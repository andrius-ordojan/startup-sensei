Today I’m joined by four time guest, Stelli fd co-founder of close.com. We have what I consider to be an amazing conversation about their pretty amazing growth being a mostly bootstrapped company to $40 million in a RR. I love talking with Sally because he is so thoughtful, but also very passionate and he and I have known each other for more than 10 years. And so there’s just this kind of common frame of reference and this understanding of each other’s history that allows us to go pretty deep, pretty quick on topics that I think matter to entrepreneurs. It’s a great conversation and I hope you enjoy it. Before we dive into that exit strategy, my new book is available on Amazon and Audible. You can of course go to exit strategy book.com to get the links or go to Amazon or Audible and search for exit strategy by Rob and Sherry Walling. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Stelli Stelli fd, welcome back to Startups For the Rest Of Us.  Steli Efti:So good to be back.  Rob Walling:It’s your fourth appearance. Your last appearance was May of 2020.  Steli Efti:Wow.  Rob Walling:May of 2020. If that day, the rings a bell with it. And it was something about how to sell during a pandemic and you were doing a lot of tugging about it. I don’t think fondly of those days. Pandemic days. I believe you’re a four time MicroConf speaker. I was trying to recall. It’s always hard to remember.  Steli Efti:I think so.  Rob Walling:And you’re the founder of close.com, your H one is stop using slow cluttered CRMs. You guys have been in business for, what is it like 13 years? Am I remembering correctly?  Steli Efti:Yeah, I think the product has been launched in January, 2013. So 12 years.  Rob Walling:And I tend to refer to you as mostly bootstrapped, meaning you raised a little bit of funding early on and then never raised again. Is that still accurate?  Steli Efti:Yeah, that’s correct.  Rob Walling:Cool. And do you want to give folks an idea of where the business stands today in terms of if you’re willing to share a RR and employee headcount?  Steli Efti:Yeah, so we are at 110 people fully remote and over 40 million in revenue. Good  Rob Walling:For you, man. Hell of a business. So when people hear this, there’s a good chunk of this audience who will know you. They will know you from this podcast, they’ll know you from MicroConf, and then there’s a chunk who don’t yet. And when I hear someone saying they built a SaaS company over 12 years, I mean it’s kind of SaaS og, right? SaaS was a thing, but I mean that’s a long time. And to also build a business of that magnitude without a bunch of funding, just a high level looking back, has the journey felt, as long as that sounds as 12 years of working on the same project or has it kind of flown by may not be the right word, but have you just day-to-day you execute and suddenly you’re here.  Steli Efti:It’s both. This sort of life is a paradox in many ways, and it feels both much longer and much shorter depending on the mood the day. But Sometimes I feel so young and then I feel so old and the time spent between those two sensations does no, this have to be that long. So similarly with running a company like this, sometimes things are just flowing and you reflect back and you go, holy shit, this has been a hell of a journey. And it’s been pretty smooth. And then there are moments where there’s trouble and you’re like, how much longer am I going to be doing this? This is too difficult. So it’s like depending on the mood and the day, but it’s definitely been a very gratifying journey for sure. A really amazing journey  Rob Walling:I can imagine. Yeah. And do you have one co-founder?  Steli Efti:Two, we have three co-founders  Rob Walling:And they all, is everyone still working or has  Steli Efti:Anything done? Okay, that is probably one of our biggest accomplishments and that probably trickled into a lot of the other things that made close special is that the three of us have been working as co-founders. We did a couple of other things before we ended up pivoting to close. So we’ve been working together as co-founders for 14 years. And I would say that our relationship today is closer than ever before and we are such different people. 14 years, there’s a lot of life that happens. So a lot of moments of crisis where everything pushes you to show up at your worst or to expect the worst or to be a little bit more selfish than you ought to be or see somebody else slack off or be selfish and all these potential for conflicts. And usually these things are the things that sort of break co-founders apart, just like any other very intense relationship. And we’ve been able to work really hard on the relationship and navigate these tricky waters and all three still work at the company and still work very intensely together.  Rob Walling:It’s really impressive on a couple fronts. Number one, it’s very unusual to have co-founders who are able to stay together that long, but it’s also really interesting that all three of you have still felt so engaged with the business because usually what happens, even if you have two, and especially with three, at some 0.1 of them is like, well, I have a life change. I have a wife and kids and I want to just move on. Or I have an idea and I’m bored with it. Whatever. There’s reasons we all move on from stuff. And with three people there’s a lot more variable. So it’s really striking that not only are the three of you still as you sit very close, I mean you’re probably really good friends I’d imagine working together that long, but that all three of you still feel like the business is invigorating to you and the best use of your time is really impressive.  Steli Efti:I think in reality, just like anything else that you really invest long-term in and any other relationship that goes on for a very long time, you’re going to have ups and downs. It’s not like all ups, no matter how great the end result is or how great the current status of affairs is. There have been times where some of us were less engaged in others. There have been many times that one of us or even all of the three of us were like, what are we even doing with our lives? Is this really what we want to be doing for the rest of our life? We’ve had all kinds of crisis of meaning and all kinds of other things. I think what has kept us together has been a combination of being very honest with each other and trusting that you can be honest and that you can be frustrated or can tell people how you really feel. And you don’t have to hide, don’t have to pretend you’re not going to be judged if you say, I’m really stressed out or I am burned out, I’m not feeling that inspired. I don’t know if AKI want to do this. You don’t have to worry that your other two co-founders are not going to conspire with a board to push you out and get your equity or some other thing, right? There’s a tremendous amount of trust. To be honest, I think we were all three quite wise in many times, recognizing that this is an emotional state that I’m in or a face and maybe this is the truth and I should act on it, but I can’t act on it right now. It’s too hot. I need to let it cool down and simmer down. I need to look at it from a number of perspectives and then I can make a good decision, but I shouldn’t just knee jerk act because it’s been a tough couple of weeks or something. And I think that more often than not, after we’ve had sort of times of crisis, it went and there was something exciting on the horizon or something engaging on the horizon. And then the other thing is I think that the three of us have built so much of a commitment to each other as well, that also sort of over the years we’ve showed up so much for each other that there’s a sort of a bond that’s very strong and a recognition that yes, maybe there’s a shiny cool co-founder over there that’s flirting with you at a bar about a new AI startup and everything’s going to be simpler and more fun. But usually that’s bullshit. And usually all problems that I have here I’ll take with me in other situations. So why not fix the problem here with people I really trust and really respect instead of just hopping to the next most exciting thing to run away from my problem. So this company’s problems, I think that all three of us have have that which people don’t usually always bring to the table that sort of perspective or little bit of wisdom. And that has saved us, I think, from making decisions that ultimately, I don’t believe that at any point, anything that we thought about of doing that would’ve been more fun or more exciting would’ve been as fulfilling and successful as what we’re currently doing.  Rob Walling:It’s a mature perspective for sure. And as you said, a lot of entrepreneurs have this, what do you call it, shiny object syndrome or a DD or grass is greeners on the other side type thing that as you said, maybe it’s, it’s an idea, maybe it’s an opportunity or maybe it’s just frustration or burnout because you do anything for 13 years, 12, 13 years, you hit points of being very unmotivated, uninterested in it. I mean, I’ve been married almost 25 years, I’ve been doing this podcast for almost 15, and I talk about same thing, right? It’s like there are ups when it’s great and there are downs when it’s like, Ooh, this is not going well at all. And I really resonate with the fact that you said, but when it’s not going well, you say, I’m not going to make a permanent solution to a temporary problem, is really what you were saying, A permanent solution is to I’m bailing, right? I’m shutting it down, I’m walking away, I’m selling my shares, or I’m just not going to work on it anymore. And that I think is something that a lot of people don’t have. It’s crazy. It’s maturity and loyalty it sounds like that the three of you have for each other. So it’s really quite striking.  Steli Efti:I think honestly, Rob, when I think back at our success, we’ve done some great things at a time, but I think most consistently it’s not been that we’ve been so brilliant that’s gotten us to where we are. It’s been that we have consistently avoided being stupid. It’s that sort of like that Charlie Munger quote of how far you can come in life if you consistently can avoid being stupid. And that’s definitely something that looking back there are very tempting times to be stupid. There’s times where it’s almost impossible not to act stupid as a founder. And in those times, I think that we’ve had the ability to sort of disconnect how we feel and realize that that may be the truth and should be acted on, but it very likely isn’t. So what is the right action is to just hold that emotion or hold that frustration, hold that anger or fear or greed and go, in Germany they say, go pregnant with it. Just walk with it a little bit. Just carry it for a couple of days. Talk to a number of people, marinate on it instead of instantly making a decision, especially decisions that can’t be easily reversed where you walk through a door you can’t go back from. And most people will act when they’re overwhelmed with fear, with greed, with whatever it is. That’s why I think a lot of companies don’t reach their potential because they kill themselves. They commit suicide rather than being killed by external forces because they overreact in situations where they should think it through a couple more times before they make a final decision.  Rob Walling:I think longevity is underrated, just staying alive and sticking around both in SaaS because as we know, it’s a long slow SaaS ramp of death. And I bet if we went back and traced close your amazing $40 million company now, but after 12 months, do you remember what the revenue was? It probably wasn’t very much.  Steli Efti:No, actually our first three years were pretty amazing. I think the first you went, oh, were they? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we’re not a good example there, but we came with a lot of unnatural momentum of running this elastic sales sales agency. We had a bit of a name in the market and all that. So the first three years were great, but we had years where growth stalled and we had years where, especially where it seemed that there were a couple of peers that surpassed us, or I even remember at MicroConf in Vegas, meeting a founder and giving him advice, and he was like, whatever. It was 5K an MRR after many years of hustling. And then I was already at whatever it was at the time, 9 billion, 11 million, whatever it was. And then two years later, his company surpasses mine and rocket ships. And if you’re long enough in the market, you’ll meet people that get richer quicker than you. And you’re like, huh, what are we doing wrong? What is going on here?  Rob Walling:There’s always something, huh?  Steli Efti:There’s always something. Oh  Rob Walling:Man, it’s funny. So I feel the same way, right? Let’s talk about this podcast, which is one of the, aside from my marriage is probably the longest thing I’ve done in my life. I guess raising kids is the other thing. I have an 18-year-old, but a lot of this podcast is just showing up 52 weeks a year. I’ve shipped an episode every week since 2010, and some people are like, wow, startups For the Rest Of Us really popular. How can I build something like that? And I’m like, I don’t know how to do it and not do it over 15 years. But then Sam Par, who for my first million, is an unknown kid. I mean, he was very young. He was in his twenties. He sends me an email when I’m in Fresno back in, I was doing Drip, so it must’ve been 2012 or 13. I still have the email in my Gmail account and it’s like, Hey, I’m in San Francisco. And he was very broey, but it was super fun. And he’s like, you, I’d like you to come to this meetup or something. I was like, I can’t make it. And then Sam Parr starts a podcast. How old is my first million? Three years, four years. And it’s 10 times the listenership of this. So to me, you, I’m like, oh, what happened? What have I been doing with my life? But then I think I have the success that I want. I have the success that I deserve. I have the success that I should be happy. It’s only through comparison that I have ever found myself not being happy with what I have. I have plenty of my life in terms of my family, my professional success, financial success, this podcast, the audience, whatever you look at, comparison is a thief of joy. That’s the quote. But I feel you that the 5K to surpassing you, it happens.  Steli Efti:And there’s a part of me with those examples, these kind of Sam pars people that you mentored and then they have a more successful company than you and all that. I have both joy and pride for them. I’m happy, I want people to be successful, but being somebody that is ambitious, being somebody that poured a lot of hard work into something and is very self-critical, you do go, what the hell am I? This is proof that I suck at this. I’m not good at this. I’m not living up. There’s this idea of full potential, which for most of my life I was chasing and I was like, I just want to grow. I want to live up to my full potential. And I think I’m coming to a stage where maybe out of convenience, maybe out of wisdom, at an old age, I come to this, what is evening? If you ask people of their full potential, we have this imaginary idea where if I did everything that I can think of myself doing, possibly, I’m like a superhuman robot. I just do all these things. And that’s not realistic. It’s easy to think of all these things and to actually live them. And when you live them, when you meet people, I’ve met a couple of people that are super successful and very, very well-known and are working harder than I’ve ever worked on to live to that sort of wake up in the morning cold plunge, this, that every minute is strict and you just fly over to this airport, do this event, fly over there, do that. And when I meet them, there’s a part of me now that just, it breaks my heart where I go, wow, they work so hard and they’re still on this treadmill and they’re not any little bit happier or more fulfilled or richer in any substantial way than they were when they were. And so there’s a part where you have to sort of realize, well, I’m doing the best I can and let’s see what’s next. Let’s just see what’s next. But there’s also something to be said for just consistently showing up in the business world. It’s just like if you cannot die, if you can just not die while maintaining optimism, fun and curiosity, which is very difficult, people that just survive usually become more cynical and then just surviving or committing suicide. I don’t know what’s better. Maybe you should just exit. If you’re just so miserable, burned out and depressed, just keep going. Maybe it’s not the right advice. But if you can survive while staying positive, curious, and having some fun, you are going to, I mean, you’re already winning, but you are going to, the chances of you eventually breaking out of whatever plateau you are and experiencing massive success are dramatic, dramatic. So if you can do something with longevity, if you could just show up day in doubt with a good attitude, with the curiosity and open-mindedness to learn to adjust where you’re not just doing the same thing that doesn’t work forever and pretend it’s working. If you can have that sort of balance of the two, it’s really magical superpower. And I didn’t do my podcast for as long as you, I did a ton of content for many, many years. I’ve been in this space for a long time, but now that I just started doing a bit more content, again, it’s surprising and humbling to get these emails and messages of people that are like, for 10 years I was reading all your stuff and blah, blah. Stelli did this for me with employees. This is a fun little experience that I have now that we are hiring people. And for the past couple of years, consistently, people would either be like, oh, I remember watching you or seeing you at MicroConf. And I thought, maybe one day I’ll work for a guy like that, and now I’m at this company or people saying, oh, when I said, when I announced on LinkedIn, I joined Close. I didn’t know about close before. I’d never heard of you before, but when I announced it, I got 15 messages on LinkedIn. Hey, say hi to Stelli. I love this content. They’re like, you’re a big deal. People know about you. And I’m like, I don’t know. I guess putting that much out there and helping that many people and showing up so much, the dividends are just even many, many years later. I can still benefit from that. My business still benefits from that. And same with you. You have such an incredible reputation. You had such incredible impact to so many people, and it’s hard sometimes you just look at the numbers, you just look at the download numbers of the YouTube views. And I remember this, he and I had a podcast, the Startup Chat for five years. We did two episodes every week, but we had plateaued for a number of years. It was just X amount of downloads, whatever it was. And then we saw all these other people that did two founders doing a podcast about startup stuff, and some of them were millions of downloads, and there was some frustration in the room. I remember I was frustrated about it, but when I think about it, there were thousands of founders that were listening to our episodes that benefited. There are hundreds, I’ve met hundreds of people. If you put it in a room, it’d be a whole conference of people that I met just from the podcast that told me one way or another, you changed my life. That’s a lot. And even meeting one person that tells you that is so moving, it’s like, wow, I really had an impact. I really did something good here. But when it’s thousands and thousands, tens of thousands, it’s a huge number. But we look at count on a YouTube and it’s like 8,000 views or something. You’re like, I’m a failure. I don’t matter totally, but it compounds. If you do it for a long time, I don’t want to rant too much about this. And it will benefit your business and your career in many, many ways and showing up consistently. It’s very, very hard to do emotionally, not to get discouraged, not to get distracted, but if you can, it’s an incredibly powerful unlock of impact and success, and it’s much more fulfilling than just doing some viral thing that gets a bunch of views, but nobody cares. Nobody uses anything that you told them. It doesn’t really make a difference in their lives.  Rob Walling:Yeah, no, I fully agree. Obviously, as someone who’s been doing this for a while, the numbers, as you said, I know I have a couple of friends who’ve been doing a podcast for years and they have 2,500 downloads per episode or something, which when I say that, a lot of people think, wow, that’s obviously a failure, but how many of us have 2,500 people listening to every word we say on a show? It’s like, yeah, you can have a lot of impact. And if you have a big impact, even on a small number of people, I still think you’re moving the world, moving it forward. I want to ask you a question about if you ever with CLO had a moment probably with your co-founders where I use this expression. I think Pel said this, Peloni founder of Balsamic said this one time at a MicroConf, but he said he woke up one day and what was it? He had deleted the credit card table or they’d been hacked or there was something that happened and he said, well, I guess it’s been a good run. I love that. I guess he literally thought the business was done, and this was years into it, and I had a few of those. I’ve had a few of those over the years. Is there any one of those moment where you guys are after the initial, the first year or whatever you’re trying to survive, but after that, did you ever think, oh man, this is going to tank us?  Steli Efti:No, so I don’t have a good story that there were many moments of crisis, right? There were many moments where, I mean, last time we talked, it was just around the pandemic. When it just started, it did raise the question, what will this mean? Is this going to be like, will we survive this? How will we survive this? But there’ve been also many sort of just internal things that happened where we did have fraudulent attacks on a massive scale, but we were lucky to catch it early enough. And it was more of a, once the crisis was averted, it was like a, oh, if we had caught this a couple of days later, it would’ve been game over. We had some moments like that, but never a moment where I thought, this is it. This is it. We’re done. No, it is also a mentality thing, and many founders have this. I am much better in a crisis than when things are particularly going well, actually, when things are going really, really well, it’s very hard sometimes to motivate myself or sometimes there’s a guilt, a weird guilt of, I know I’m not working as hard as this success right now. There’s all kind of weird things going on, but when things are going really well, it’s not my happiest time. I’m doing okay. I’m learning to get better at this, but it’s not my happiest time when there’s a big crisis. Not that I don’t enjoy it, I really worry. I have anxiety, I have stress, I fear, but there’s a deep rooted trust that I know I’m showing up and I’m going to weather this crisis. There’s something that just, there’s a voice in my head that says, you’re going to survive this. You’re going to find a solution to this. I don’t know where that’s coming from, but it’s always been there. And we’ve gone through enough of these that now it’s over many. I’ve been an entrepreneur for over 20 years, over so many crisis. There’s a very deep rooted, and we had a security issue two years ago, three years ago where something happened, something was exposed. Somebody emailed us about that exposure of something, and there was, it sort of very quickly skyrocketed into almost like panic mode where a couple of engineers looked at it and they’re like, oh my God, we didn’t realize this thing. And they extrapolate it. And even one of the co-founders got sucked into this panic mode. And the problem when I started catching up on the threat as I was reading it, the problem was growing bigger and bigger and bigger. It was really like, this is a huge issue. And the proposed sort of like, we have to email every customer right now. We have to do all these very drastic moves. And again, I thought, all right, wait a second. This is not the vibe here. It just doesn’t feel right. Let’s analyze one thing at a time. This person that emailed us, there’s all these insertions in interpretation. So who this person is and what the context is, do we really know? Let’s isolate that. Let’s research who is this person and what is that person’s intent in sending us this information? Then secondly, let’s actually how many customers were really affected by that right now nobody knows. Let’s put a team together where we research what is the security problem, how quickly can we fix it? Let’s put the most resources in just fixing it right now, and then what we communicate and to whom and who we pay money to, and the legal implications. We’ll tackle that one team at a time, one thing, but right now we can’t tackle any of this unless we know these other factors. And then we put three or four teams on these different little projects, and a day later we came back with some information that was like, okay, everybody calm down. It’s not as bad as everybody thought. Let’s take another two days to get more answers. And by the end of the week, it was like three customers were maybe affected by probably not, and we send it to a legal team, we send it to a security company. What do we really have to do? Is this really the right evaluation? Everybody came back. Almost nothing has to happen. We fixed the issue. Almost nothing has to happen. Everybody’s protected, everything’s fine. I was like, wow. We were so close to sending an email that would’ve put thousands and thousands of all our customers in panic mode. And then once that cat is out of the back, you can’t put it back in. There’s no way to reverse that. Oops. Yeah.  Rob Walling:By the way, remember the email we got the other day? Well, that was said in mistake. So now it’s like, we don’t know what  Steli Efti:The fuck we’re doing. Don’t know what fuck we’re doing. Trust us, we told you you can’t trust us, but we figured out you cannot trust us about not trusting us, but you should trust us. And that was so easy. There was such a momentum towards that action. There was such a built momentum, and all it took was one cool head at that time, it was mine. At other times it had been other people’s. I remember when I mentioned to you when we first started in the very first year, we had telephony always enclosed, by the way, inbound and outbounds. You can make calls, receive calls, enc close, you can phone tree with closed everything. And in the beginning we had free trials and we gave people complete free unlimited telephony on the trial, being a bunch of noobs and a startup we’re like, oh, free. Just do as much as you want.  Rob Walling:Listeners, don’t do that. Don’t do that. Don’t do that. Yeah. So what happened? I’m waiting for this story. This is building up for me.  Steli Efti:So then we were lucky. We were lucky that one of my co-founders out of interest would randomly look at the call logs to just see what kind of interesting calls which countries just out of an interest. And one random weekend was, this is weird. There’s these calls and they’re very long. They’re going on for eight hours. That can’t be right. And then he started digging and figured out, well, they’re calling sort of pay per minute numbers, whatever it is. And it’s like, wait a second. That account is calling 20 of these numbers, and he’s never hanging up. And then started looking into it. And I think he discovered that we had one kind of fraud account that had generated 20, 30,000 in calling costs for us in 48 hours. And we had at that point, no fraud detection. We didn’t have the systems in place to sort of flag that. And if it hadn’t been for us, just generally curious, looking around once in a while, we had sort of calculated out that within a week it would’ve bankrupt us. It’s just like we didn’t have enough money. It would’ve bankrupt, and it would’ve been such a sudden death that we would’ve seen it coming. And since then, I mean, we’ve gotten really good at fraud production and we don’t allow people to just make calls. But even since then, I’ve been amazed how consistently and creatively fraudulent scammers would use some scheme to make money with texting or calling or whatever in close or use the email capabilities or any other tool that we have. I’ve been always amazed at the creativity. I’ve always been amazed at how do these people even know we exist? We’re such a small company, especially in the first couple of years, but that was an example of that. We would’ve just gotten $300,000 in calling costs from free accounts, and we didn’t have that much money on a bank account to pay. And that would’ve been it. And if it was me and just the third co-founder, the technical engineer guy, and the sales marketing guy wouldn’t have seen it needed the ops guy that looked under the hood and wandered around to catch that early enough to save the company.  Rob Walling:So that’s getting a little lucky in that case. I talk a lot about, I’ll tell founders, Hey, to be successful, you need some combination of hard work, luck and skill. That’s what I believe, whether everyone may or may not agree with it, but I think you have to put up hard work in to do most things that are worthwhile. And I think you have to develop and build some type of skillset to do it. And then sometimes you get really lucky and you need a lot less hard work and skill than other people. But usually, usually, I don’t want to count on luck. I want repeatable things that I can do. I want to start a company with a repeatable approach. That sounds like you guys stayed alive. I know you’ve worked hard over the years. I know each of you have developed skills to be able to grow the company, and sometimes you need to get a little lucky in order to stay alive, it sounds like. So I want to ask you about a recent pricing change that you made in January, which was last month as we’re recording this, and you mentioned offline that for years your entry level plan into close was in the 39 40 $9 range. And there were folks, there’s always folks saying, oh, I would use you. This is every SaaS ever. If you were cheaper, I would use you. Right? But you said you’ve gotten a lot of feedback over the years of, hey, if you had whatever, a 15 or $19 plan that for one seat that I would be willing to do it. And so in January you launched this plan, and I believe it’s $19 if you pay monthly and 15 if you pay annually, give or take. So I’m curious to ask a couple of questions. Why did you decide to launch that plan? I’m sure you’ve been hearing the same feedback about having a cheaper plan for 10 or 10 plus years since the day you launched, right? But why do it now and then to find out is that working for you? Do you have enough data to be like, oh, this was a good choice, or is it more cannibalizing your, I guess, your $49 plan?  Steli Efti:Yeah, I’ll say a couple of things about that. One is that I think pricing is a much bigger deal in software than I realized for the first couple of years, especially once you get to some level of scale, pricing is really a big driver of growth. And I think that for many, many years, we were just too small up until, whatever it was, two, three years, we were just less than 50 people for most of the company’s history. We’re a very small team, and we just didn’t have people to really work on pricing in a dedicated manner to really do a lot of testing. And I think we always thought about, we were always a little scared to have compete on low prices and get more volume of customers because we’re such a small team and because our more higher ranked pricing always worked really well for the business and for the kind of customers we wanted to attract. But there was always this, it was always bumming us out that I would get on a podcast like this one and I would talk about clothes, and then sometimes we did promos about eBooks, other things, and sometimes we told people that We’ll give you a good deal. And then they would come and sign up for clothes and they would say, Hey, I’m a micro entrepreneur. I’m trying out a couple of ideas and I really love clothes, but my ideas are not taking off yet. Or This thing I’m doing is not taking off yet. It’s going to take probably a little longer than I thought. And there’s this competitor product and it’s not as nice as close, but it does do the job and it’s three times cheaper, so I’m going to just switch over there and then once I’m really successful, I’ll come back just, and it’s just always a bummer when people would leave because of that versus the product isn’t working or it’s not working for me. Now, you’re right, there’s always going to be people that want cheaper when it’s free, they’re going to complain that you don’t have enough features or you don’t give them enough support is going to end. But only recently have we really felt like, wow, the company’s big enough now where we can make some more investments in the growth of the business into our customer base, sort of grow earlier with them and grow with them, versus being sort of very disciplined about what kind of customer we can really serve. And when we had the internal resources to run experiment to know people can consistently work on something like pricing versus we were always afraid to touch it because we knew once we touch it and change it, nobody here will want to look into it again and have to redo the work of pricing because we’re such a small team and everybody is too much on their plate already, and it’s too early to conclusively say. I can tell you that I think two years ago, we packaged our prices and we did a big pricing change, somebody champion at close where the prices were higher and it were packaged number of seeds, and that was a terrible decision for us. And instead of helping with retention and fixing a bunch of problems, it messed with all our metrics. And it took a long time to really admit that and a long time to reverse that. This pricing change is newer, but it’s also less sort of all compounding. It’s just an entry level plan. It doesn’t touch or change everything else that we’re doing. And the instant result is that our customer acquisition is skyrocketing in terms of just how many customers we’re converting. So with a lot more customers, those customers seem to retain a little bit better. Now, what we’re going to have to look at over the next couple of months is do they grow and upgrade and how does that affect all other numbers? But we’re pretty excited about it so far, especially as I believe we’re going to see more entrepreneurship. More and more people will start things, try things. We’re going to see more smaller teams accomplish big things in the future. I want the earliest youngest entrepreneur in their journey to come and use clothes and use the power of clothes and not feel like, oh, that’s a solution once we’re sort of enterprise level ready. So I’m psyched about just getting more entrepreneurs and business owners and more small businesses on the platform, and it feels now that we have a scale and a size where we can make these investments, even if it takes a long time for us to pay off,  Rob Walling:That makes a lot of sense. Pricing changes always take a long time to figure out, because there’s retention, there’s all these things. It’s not, oh, hey, I got more people or I’m making more revenue in the next 60 days. It really is kind of a long tail. So folks want to check out close, obviously close.com, and I often recommend close.com/guides, which is, I mean, gosh, an extensive collection of sales guides ranging from the ultimate sales pitch deck 12 sales pipeline templates, sales management software tools. The ultimate sales pitch guide is just a lot of eBooks. I know you originally wrote, I think most of them, but I think maybe other people on your team have contributed to those in the recent years.  Steli Efti:Maybe the last of, I don’t know even how many there are there, but if you go back to the first 40, they’re all for me and I’m going through them now that I’m back in the content game to revisit my old videos and my old stuff, and most of them still hold up pretty well. I would have to say any advice there on how to sell as a startup, how to negotiate as a startup, how to hire salespeople as a startup, all that stuff is pretty solid. It was timeless, so I’m happy to say, so that stuff should help anyone that is doing a startup and is trying to get customers.  Rob Walling:So that’s close.com/guides, and then you have a YouTube show or a podcast, a video podcast, I dunno how you think about it, but it’s called The zero to 30 million Blueprint.  Steli Efti:Yeah. Last year people eventually pressured me into our corner at the company and said, you have to get back in the game. People want you, you, let’s revisit how we went from zero to 30 million in revenue, and let’s do a couple of seasons where we sort of break down the different stages. So you can go on YouTube and find the zero to 30 million blueprint, but also just go to Elli on X or Stelli FD on LinkedIn. I’m getting back into the game of publishing a lot of content that’s timely and relevant right now. And as always with people that listen to this podcast, especially, send me an email stelli@close.com if you need advice, if you want feedback. I’ve been a part of the MicroConf community for many years, as you mentioned, and really some incredible stories have come out of it and some great friendships. So I’m always happy to hear from people that listen to the podcast and want to connect or want to get feedback or help.  Rob Walling:Amazing. Sally fte, thanks so much for joining me again,  Steli Efti:My man. Rob, thank you. It was a pleasure.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Stelli FTE for joining me on the show. And thanks to you for listening this week and every week.

This is episode nine where we hear how it all turns out for Colleen and Hello Query. Before we get into this episode, if you’re a founder who’s interested in the right amount of funding without the unicorn or bust pressure to scale your SaaS to a billion, you’re probably a good fit for TinySeed applications just closed for our Spring 2025 batch, but you can get more details about our world-class SaaS accelerator at TinySeed dot com slash program and get onto our mailing list to be notified when our applications open in the fall. And with that, let’s dive into the episode.  Colleen Schnettler:I don’t want to have a five year side project. This is so important to me. I have so many friends and good for them that works with their life. I have actually, you know what? I have a five-year side project that makes $2,000 a month, right? And it hasn’t grown and it just sits there. I don’t want another one of those. I want to outpaced success.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. For the past two years, we’ve been following Colleen’s journey building. Hello Query. When we started these conversations, we hoped to document the path to success. Instead, we captured something equally valuable, the real raw experience of trying to get a business off the ground while most startup stories end quietly behind closed doors. In this final episode, Colleen gives us a candid look at one of the hardest decisions a founder can make and gives us a hint about what she’s working on next.  Colleen Schnettler:Well, Rob, the good news is I have tripled my MRR since we last spoke, and  Rob Walling:If I recall, it was like a hundred, 150 a month, and so you’re at five 40 or something  Colleen Schnettler:180. So although triple your MRR sounds really amazing, $540 does not a business make. So it’s been a lot of thought about what to do with this and every single one of those three sales, so that’s three new customers since we last spoke and we last spoke a couple months ago. Every single one was horrendously painful. I mean, it was follow up and follow up and follow up and onboarding calls and back and forth, and I just don’t see a repeatable path to getting new customers. That is sadly the truth. I had more people that said they were interested, like I said, three converted of that initial list, but every single person finding them has been just like a needle in a haystack.  Rob Walling:And I want to point out that that doesn’t mean it’s not a viable business, but it does conflict with the fact that we’re recording this in January of 2025, and last time we spoke, which I think was October, maybe November of 24, you said, I run out of runway by the end of December, 2024. So if you were in the position, you are now at five 40 MRRA year ago, two years ago, where you still had all this runway, I would say, well, you’re onto something. Keep pulling this thread. And if you’re like, I still have 12 months of runway from TinySeed money or what have you consulting, and I have the motivation, I’m going to keep going, but you have given this. Now, we started recording this podcast two years ago, almost to the day, and you were working on it for six, 12 months before that. So is that right? Are you almost three years into this?  Colleen Schnettler:So I appreciate that sentiment, but I would like to point out that I completely started over a year ago. So we’re talking different business, different tech stack. So when I look Atlo Query specifically, it’s really like 10 to 12 months old.  Rob Walling:And so with that in mind, we could say, well, it’s only a 10 month old business. You’re already a 500 MRR and you have a thread that’s being pulled, and some people are jumping on it even though it’s a pain to find them. So does that mean you should keep doing it or is it I’m out of money and I got to be done?  Colleen Schnettler:So that’s the hard part with these kind of small businesses is making that decision. One thing that is really important to me is I don’t want to have a five year side project. This is so important to me. I have so many friends and good for them that works with their life. Actually, you know what? I have a five-year side project that makes $2,000 a month and it hasn’t grown, and it just sits there. I don’t want another one of those. I want to outpaced success. That’s what I’m going for. And I think, although Hello Query itself is only about a year old, this idea because the previous business was a different iteration on this idea, this idea is three years old, and I am just not seeing the traction for the amount of marketing effort and sales effort and cold outbound I have been doing. I am just not seeing the traction I think I should be seeing if I was actually building something people want at the right time. And I think timing is important here too. We can get into why this business hasn’t worked, but I think timing is a big part of it.  Rob Walling:So why didn’t it work?  Colleen Schnettler:That’s a big question. And even making the decision to shut it down or keep going, even you asked me this a couple months ago and we had scheduled this podcast and I asked you to push it out. Do you remember? I was like, I’m not ready. I’m not ready to make that decision yet. Do you watch Ted lasso Rob? It’s the hope that kills you, man, every month starting in November, I was like, I’m going to shut it down at end of November and then I’d get a new customer December. I’m going to shut it down, got a new customer. So it’s just like, it’s the hope that kills you.  Rob Walling:Ask anyone who started a business and eventually had to close up shop and they’ll tell you it’s hard. You put so much time, money, and effort into making something work that walking away is a really difficult decision to make.  Colleen Schnettler:It was such a hard decision to make, but I think when I look at the opportunity cost of continuing this one customer a month, I mean, that’s not going to be outpaced returns. That’s a never ending slog. And that’s, I’ve been doing that for three years. That’s what I have been doing. So when I think about shutting it down, I think part of it is just my own exhaustion with this idea. And part of it is all the things that happened to get me to this point, why it didn’t work is a different question. And I have been thinking about that a lot.  Rob Walling:I often get asked, how do I know when to quit? And the answer is, I don’t know, but I have guidelines is really my answer. And part of my answer that I give is, are you just done with the business? Are you just exhausted? You don’t have any new ideas. You kind of don’t care about it anymore. There’s no track, and you’re just like, I don’t want to keep doing this. That’s one factor. There’s a bunch of other factors. How much traction are you getting? What are your mastermind, your co-founder, your spouse, your coach, whatever? What are they saying? How long have you been doing it? Do you normally stick with things longer than you should or do you normally quit things too early? What’s your personal bend? There’s a bunch of factors, but to hear you say, I’m kind of, it’s felt like a never ending slog, and it’s been that for a year or two, three years, it’s like, okay, I haven’t heard you put it in those terms before, but that tells me you are kind of done, unquote done. Yeah.  Colleen Schnettler:What is so hard about this? It almost feels like it might be starting to work. And you always worry, right? You always worry. You’re like, am I just one quarter away? I had three cold inbound this month. I’ve had zero cold inbound for six months and three people, one guy came through intercom and actually is paying me now. I’m like, oh  Rob Walling:My gosh. Yeah.  Colleen Schnettler:Is it working? I don’t know. It’s so hard because I knew if I had a crystal ball and I was like, I’m one quarter turn away. I’m on the right path, but I’m too early. I would slog along, man, I’m great at slogging. I can slog forever. What is so hard about this decision is it actually might kind of be working, but it’s working at this glacial pace. But you have to hold that in comparison to starting something new. Where to start something new would take me another year. You have to product, you have to build all these marketing systems, you have to build. There’s so much other stuff around a business. So this is why this was such a hard decision is because I have come so far, but also sunk cost fallacy. I can make a lot of more money doing other things. And that’s become so obvious to me recently that it’s like, do I really want to continue to pour my heart and soul and my time into this thing when people kind of seem interested?  Rob Walling:If you recall from our earlier episodes, Colleen and her co-founder split, I wondered how much she thought that impacted the success or failure of the business.  Colleen Schnettler:He was the database expert, and sometimes I wonder if he was still working with me, we would have his kind of database clout to be like, he said, it’s safe and everyone trusts him when it comes to databases. I think that was huge. I think he was building the tech, and so when he left, we literally lost anything he had created. I was completely starting over from scratch. I didn’t have a half build application. I didn’t have a design. I was just starting over completely from scratch. So honestly, I think it was a huge, huge blow. And Hello Query is my thing, and I take responsibility for how it hasn’t worked out. I don’t want to place blame, but I do think it is a big reason. It’s hard not to think. What if he had stuck it out? Could we have made this work together? I still kind of think we could have, which is kind of sad, but unfortunately it didn’t go that way.  Rob Walling:And then you told me offline, you use this phrase nerd famous in quotes as a potential contributing factor to the business not working. Describe what you mean by that term.  Colleen Schnettler:This is something actually you speak about frequently, but both my co-founder and I were very well known in our respective communities. We both spoke at conferences, we had a podcast. People loved us. And I think that brought us false positive signals because the reason after he quit, the reason I kept going with this idea is because it felt like we had all of these people who had said they were really interested. But looking back at those conversations, I’m not saying those people weren’t interested casually, but I think that was more they just kind of wanted to be part of something, which is awesome and exciting, and I super appreciate their support, but that doesn’t help us build a product business. Look at his success in courses directly ties to his popularity in his community. If you’re popular in your community, you do courses, you do coaching, that’s how you capitalize on popularity. And we were trying to build a SaaS and popularity doesn’t matter when you build a SaaS,  Rob Walling:Ta-da, build your network, not your audience. If you’re going to build a  Colleen Schnettler:SaaS, like someone has said this before, I’ve never heard  Rob Walling:This before. Yeah,  Colleen Schnettler:I think I continued down this path because I thought I had a list of 20 people ready to buy. Literally in close, I have this list of 20 people that says ready to buy. Do you know how many of those people actually bought  Rob Walling:One  Colleen Schnettler:5% close rate on your ready to buy list? Right? And I mean, these are people, I think what kind of amazes me about this whole thing is these people get on a call with me, and I’ve done so many of these calls now, I feel like I’m pretty good at filtering through bs, why someone wouldn’t actually buy the thing, and I just get ghosted hard. They get on a freaking call with me and then they ghost me. And so it’s the curse of the audience, but I feel like it’s a double edged sword because you wouldn’t have any initial interest if we didn’t have those audiences. So it’s hard to know. But I do think that’s part of the reason when Aaron quit, part of the reason I kept with this idea, even though this was not my idea and I’m not a database expert, was because I thought, oh, I got that list of 20 people that are ready to buy. So that was really where it kind of got me,  Rob Walling:Given everything that happened, I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of regrets Colleen had about Hello Query.  Colleen Schnettler:I guess I have regrets about the way I ran the business. I don’t have regrets about doing the business. I mean, I quit a job, a really good job, Rob, to do this business. It was a really good job. Oops, to do this. I mean, I regret how things worked out with my co-founder. I wish we had both been honest about what we wanted earlier. And that’s a lesson. My next business, I want a, I don’t really like doing it alone. I’m super lonely. So that’s a lesson I’ll take with me. I’ll be like, Erin and I made this mistake. I think we would both agree we made a mistake by getting caught up in all the things and not taking a step back and being like, what do we each need and what do we each want? So I’ve learned a lot about what I want in a future. I regret we didn’t handle our issues earlier, but I made some really big decisions that have put me in this position. A big one is you might remember I had that quarter million dollar contract when we joined TinySeed, which is probably why we got into TinySeed. But anyway, and I killed that a year in, you remember we talked about it, which seemed, I don’t regret that at all because the whole point of going through TinySeed was to put ourselves in a position to go big or go home. It wasn’t to ride this kind of comfortable productized consulting situation. So I don’t regret that. So I don’t have a lot of regrets. Just if you,  Rob Walling:That’s good. I think if you build a business or do any type of risky effort that doesn’t work out, you’re probably always going to have some regrets. And I think it’s important to not think that just because it didn’t work that you made the wrong decision, the outcome is actually separate from the inputs, right?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes.  Rob Walling:And there’s this great book by the winningest football coach of all time Bill Walsh. And the title of the book is The Score Takes Care of Itself. And throughout the book he says things like, and then I’d win a Super Bowl. And everyone’s like, you’re going to win next year. And he was like, good God, this is brutal. And he said, no matter what we did, no matter how hard we trained, we controlled what we could control and we let the score take care of itself. And some years he said, we had an amazing team and I was still a great coach, and we had Montana and Rice and we would lose the Super Bowl, and then other years we would win it. And I controlled what I could control and let the score take care of itself. So I think separating inputs from outputs is something that I think is often a more healthy way to look at it.  Colleen Schnettler:I like to think like that. I like to, I mean, to be clear, this totally sucks. I don’t want to sugarcoat that, but I do like to think about it. I went all in and not only did I go all in, Rob, I’m now doing it publicly on your podcast. So that’s fun for me. Only  Rob Walling:10,000 of your closest matter friends, only 10,000 of my closest friends, only tens, sorry, tens of thousands. I misspoke there.  Colleen Schnettler:Oh my goodness. So when Aaron quit, we had even talked about pulling this podcast. Remember? We were like, should we just shut this down? And then we were like, no, we’re going to ride it to the bitter end.  Rob Walling:We want to tell the real story.  Colleen Schnettler:I’m happy. I went all in on this. And I think you’re right. I controlled everything I could control. I did all the things. I did the marketing and the sales and the content and the following up and the freaking cold calling. I built the product. I fixed the product. I controlled everything I could control for, and I can’t control how many people sign up. I can’t control my MRR, and that’s a super bummer. I have worked so hard by myself, toiling in my office. And so it’s a super bummer, but I ultimately can’t control control that. And all I can say is I think there has to be an aspect of luck, a small aspect of luck here. And I didn’t get lucky, but maybe next time I will  Rob Walling:Probably heard me say, I feel like success is hard work. Luck and skill in different components and luck is a factor. It’s not the only factor. And I don’t even believe it’s the biggest factor, but I do believe that it absolutely is. And I also think hard work is something we all can control and put in the hours. There’s a skillset that you develop over the years that I think develops even faster once you’ve been part of a successful venture. Once you’ve done it, once you learn some things, it’s not that you can then apply that to the next thing directly, but it does build that skill muscle up. And until you have that, it can be hard. You can have a lot of hard work, and if you don’t have any luck and your skills are, you’re developing them, but they’re not quite at the level of someone who’s done this two, three times, it can be really hard to get past those uncertain days. The early days are so uncertain.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I think you look back again, trying to figure out why didn’t work for me, it’s like did I not pivot enough? Did I pivot too many times? I thought I would be able to pivot myself to this working right? I thought it was ship modify, ship modify. And as we talked about at the top of the hour, if I’d started this two months ago, we’d be like, this is going great. So there’s just a lot of sunk cost and emotion. It’s kind of a mess. This whole business,  Rob Walling:After months of going back and forth, Colleen had finally made her decision. I asked her what that felt like.  Colleen Schnettler:On one hand, it’s nice to have made the decision because there were many, many times this year when I was thinking about it. Should I, should I shouldn’t I, should I shouldn’t I, right? So it’s nice to have decided, and I think that’s important to move forward. I mean, it totally sucks. It is awful. I feel awful. So I wanted this to work so badly, and so it not working is a big disappointment. But I also know that I’ll get to try again, right? I’ll be able to take all of these lessons I’ve learned and try again. And it’s not like it’s, I’m 65 and I’m like, oh, I don’t have the energy. I’m good. I could do it again. It’s hard to connect the dots. You can’t connect the dots going forward. You can only connect them going backwards. But I did start this thing, this SaaS marketing gym, which has been awesome. And I think it was funny because I started SaaS Marketing Jim with Leanna Patch, who is a brilliant copywriter. And we made a lot of money in a very short period of time. And I don’t mean that to be like, oh, we’re so great. I mean, compared to my SaaS, comparing this coaching, I was like, my SaaS has made $1,200 in the past year. This thing made $12,000 in four days. Clearly this is not Rob doing something right here. So there was a bit of that where it was like, oh, maybe this isn’t this thing that I don’t love. It’s not really a passion project for me. Maybe it is time to walk away. It’s still hard though. It’s still hard, Rob. It’s still very hard.  Rob Walling:And that’s the thing that I want to call out here is obviously we’re going to end this season on a high note or ahead at the future that you have as you write off into the sunset. But I don’t think either of us want to sugarcoat how much of a bummer it is to have to shut down a business and to not succeed at what you’ve been trying to do for one to three years. But also, I’ve heard some aspiring entrepreneurs, usually it’s like a developer working a day job who’s doing just fine and says, well, what if I start something and it doesn’t work? What if I quit my day job and it doesn’t work? And I often say, well, what is the worst case in that scenario? You probably get another job at the end, or maybe you’ve learned enough that someone will acquihire you, or maybe you’ve learned enough that someone will just hire you because of the experience you have there. Or maybe you start your next thing because you met someone. There’s all these things that can happen that are positives coming out of a failure. So I want to call that out of for you. Six months ago, if we would’ve said, what’s the worst that can happen? Or even, let’s go back three years ago when you quit your job. I would say, well, the worst that happens probably is you just get another job. But now you’re at a place where that’s not actually, you’re not going back to get another job. You’ve done the SaaS Marketing Gym, which people, if they go to Google type in SaaS Marketing gym, they’ll see you and Leanne, a smiling face there. So you have this new business already that you’re excited about. I would venture to say that part of the reason that that’s going to be a thing is because of the relationships, the audience, the network that you’ve cultivated over the past couple of years in building at LA Query. And so, I dunno, I like to think of each thing. Usually if I’m going to fail at it, at least can it level me up along the way?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah. And before we joined TinySeed, we weren’t really doing any marketing. I mean, I have leveled up from a marketing perspective so much, and that’s going to be tremendously valuable with all the things I do next.  Rob Walling:Is there anything as you think back, that you would have done differently during this journey?  Colleen Schnettler:That’s tough. So practically speaking, I don’t think we executed fast enough that first year. And that’s a very practical thing, but we didn’t execute on the code front. We were building this list of people who wanted the thing, and we didn’t ship the thing fast enough. So I think shipping fast, I mean, that’s what everyone says, but it’s still true. Shipping faster, I would do differently. So much of this is kind of a, I don’t want to say a crapshoot, but in the very beginning, you’re just trying things to see if they work. I probably also would’ve started cold outreach a year earlier. Those two things together I would’ve done.  Rob Walling:Usually when people ask me about regrets with things, I often say, I wish I would’ve done X sooner. That’s usually always right? It’s like, oh, now that I know this, I didn’t know about this approach or I didn’t know that I should do that. Or I was too scared sometimes where it’s like, Rob, if you could do my whole career over, what would you do? I would’ve done video earlier. I didn’t do video really until Covid until 2020. I should have been doing video in 20, well, once I sold Drip 2016, and I just was like, Ooh, I don’t know. It’s hassle. It’s complicated. I’m not good on camera. All this stuff. I have this my own. And is it a regret or is it just a thing of, the lesson I learned is do more shit that scares you and try to educate yourself on things that you don’t know about. What are your blind spots that you should be doing? So  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I think for me, things, a lot of co-founder stuff would’ve handled that faster. Earlier I knew that was kind of a problem and I didn’t push on it. And for reasons would’ve done that faster, would’ve shipped faster, would’ve done cold outreach faster. It’s so many things. Even on the tech side, once I was doing all the tech myself, I found myself dragging my feet on. It wasn’t even really dragging my feet. I just feel like I still could have been faster. I still could have pushed a little bit harder because of the security stuff. I was scared to launch and betting because I was like, oh. I was like, oh, because I’m really good at thinking of corner cases, but when you’re just getting started, corner cases aren’t your best friend. So just so much stuff. So I think in general, that’s true, right? Do more things that scare you.  Rob Walling:When I’ve asked other founders after their business has shut down, what are things that you regret or that you would do differently? I’ve never once heard them say I would’ve executed more. So we moved too fast, we shipped too many things too quickly. We took too many risks. Nah, it doesn’t happen. Not at least not in our world. So as we look ahead then to your next weeks, months, years, what is ahead for you? What are you excited about? What are you working on?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, I’m doing the SaaS Marketing Gym, which right now is kind of a founder coaching, but it’s founder coaching and marketing. We just finished our first cohort. It’s three month cohorts, and it went really well. The people have great results, so it’s amazing to help people and then have them have actual new customers of the cold. We really focus, or I really focus on the cold LinkedIn outbound, and it’s working. I mean, it’s working, so that’s cool. So I’m going to do that. But the nice thing is, as Leanna and I are dialing that in, it doesn’t take a ton of time. So I think I have to have some big thoughts about do I try to expand coaching into a community and become more of a content coach creator? Do I do another product business? And if so, what would that look like? How would I get into that? What can I take from what I learned about Hello Query and apply it to the next thing I do?  Rob Walling:Very nice. Well, Colleen Schettler, thanks for sharing the real story. I just really appreciate you coming on here for the past two years and sharing again, the kind of the authentic journey and not sugarcoating it. And I think it will make a good story for people who have also struggled to have success and who have maybe had a failure or shut down to hear you go through it and be like, yeah, this is a normalized thing. We’ve all done this. Frankly, almost all of anybody who has had some success has achieved this, or anyone who has had some success has probably had an effort that no matter their best efforts, they’ve controlled what they could control and let the score take care of itself. And sometimes the score doesn’t go in your favor. So thanks for doing that.  Colleen Schnettler:Thanks for having me, Rob. It’s been a blast recorded with you these past two years. Obviously, I wish it had gone differently, but I gave this business everything I have and then some. So I am proud of the effort I put in and the work and the dedication I’ve had towards this business. And unfortunately it didn’t go my way this time, but hopefully next time it will. And quick reminder to all your listeners, that SaaS marketing gym.com is my new marketing founders marketing for Founders Coaching Business. First founders are loving it. It’s a small, tight knit group of other founders. Would love to have you.  Rob Walling:Thank you to Colleen for sharing not just the highlights and victories, but the real messy process of building and winding down a business. I’m looking forward to seeing what she does next. And thanks to you for listening. If you’re an ambitious founder building a B2B SaaS company, you should consider applying to TinySeed.

I’m your host this week and every week and in this week’s show I talk with Jordan Gaul, the founder of rosie@heyrosie.com. Jordan and his team have been building this AI answering service for your business calls, and he has pivoted the company from what was an e-commerce headless checkout. And this is all after raising quite a bit of money in venture capital. And so you will hear Jordan in this interview mention that they had a few million dollars left in the bank and he kind of flippantly says it. I think that’s funny because when you’re in that game, he meant I only have a few million left in the bank. But obviously having that much money in your bank account gives you some optionality, and that’s what Jordan takes advantage of as you’ll hear in this interview as you listen to it, what I don’t want you to think is, oh, well Jordan is making it work. He has a bunch of money in the bank because money doesn’t solve your problems. What solves your problems is trial and error, gut feel execution, finding that gap in the market, being committed, doing a lot of things quickly and having most of them work out. And that’s what Jordan Gaul has done both with this company and his prior effort Cart Hook. You’ll hear that in the first three or four minutes, the story of growing that to millions in a RR and then getting squashed by Shopify. It’s a great conversation. We cover all manner of topics ranging from getting started to what it feels like to build, and I’ll put in quotes, an AI wrapper moving very quickly and what it feels like to have product-market fit. Jordan has signed up to be one of our founding coaches of the SaaS Institute. That’s at SaaS institute.com and it’s for B2B SaaS founders doing a million or more in a RR. He’s a phenomenal founder and we are lucky to have him as one of our coaches. If you are interested in potentially being part of a mastermind, getting one-on-one coaching, having an amazing community, head to SaaS institute.com to check it out. It is a premium paid coaching program that we are rolling out through TinySeed. And lastly, before we get going, applications for MicroConf Mastermind matching are open right now and those are open for all levels of revenue, not just a million and up applications close on March 31st. Head to MicroConf masterminds.com. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Jordan.  Jordan Gal:Jordan Gal, welcome back to the show. Rob, it’s good to be back with you. It’s been a few years, not the first time, so not the second time. Maybe the third, fourth, I don’t know, but it’s been a while and it’s great to be back.  Rob Walling:Yeah, you’ve been on at least three, maybe four episodes, so really appreciate it. Today we’re here to tell the story of Rosie and it has been a journey. Sir, you were telling me offline you are four years between product market fits with two different apps. So you want to give summarize cart hook for folks and then kind of catch ’em up where there’s rally and then there is Rosie. And then we’ll talk about, I want to find out where Rosie is today, where it stands, team size. You don’t have to share revenue, but just anything that gives people an idea of what’s going on and then we’ll dive into other stuff.  Jordan Gal:Alright, cool. So the reason you and I almost giggle a little as we talk about the drama is because you followed along, you invested in card hook, so you’ve been getting investor updates for years. For me, probably 10,  Rob Walling:I guess 10 years. Not every month  Jordan Gal:As any of my investors know, but regular, consistent. Anyway, so yeah, card Hook had product-market fit, card Hook was a checkout for Shopify stores before that was a thing, we were one of the first and it flew, so there was a point in time where it was adding 30, 40, 50 K in MRR every month. No advertising, word of mouth, just flying. It went from a million a RR to two-ish and then six. So very quick growth bootstrap ish. We took a few bucks from friends and family, but it effectively bootstrapped in the way it conducted itself. And then it ran into a wall named Shopify. So they did not want checkouts to take payment processing off of their platform and they ended car hook’s run. So I had the taste of product-market fit, it felt good, it felt really good. And then I started a company called Rally, which was an e-commerce checkout or for everyone outside of Shopify and that was intended for what was called the headless ecosystem. That didn’t quite work. We went toward enterprise, that kind of worked. We got to a few hundred k and a RR, it wasn’t going fast enough and then we pivoted to Rosie. So I went through this big dip over the last few years, we pivoted to Rosie, an AI voice agent that answers the phone for small businesses. And it might be a bit premature to call it product-market fit, but it feels familiar.  Rob Walling:Got it. So it’s growing fast. And Rosie, when you say small businesses, do you mean like lawn care maybe electricians, cleaners where they’re out doing stuff and their cell phone’s ringing all day, right, while they’re trying to do stuff and so this rosy acts as an AI agent. I ask this knowing the answer because I’ve called your rosy number and I asked the questions, but I want the listeners to understand what’s going on.  Jordan Gal:Yes, there are a lot of businesses in the economy that rely on the phone and it ranges from I’m a painter and I’m on the job and I can’t answer the phone to I’m that same painter and it’s 10:00 AM on Saturday and the phone rings and I’m with my family having breakfast and I don’t know if I should answer the phone, but it might be a $10,000 job all the way to, hey, it’s after hours and we’re a water remediation company, we got to pick up for emergencies and it’s 11 o’clock at night. And up until now, the only option I’ve had is an answering service that I pay for a human. So it lives somewhere in between voicemail and answering services. But any businesses, it tends to be local businesses, the type that you search for online and then you call on the phone to interact with, that’s who we’re helping. It’s like a very, very gnarly problem, which I can talk about how painful the problem is has led to challenging my assumptions around churn.  Rob Walling:And can you give us an idea of where the business stands today, team size, growth, whatever you want to disclose.  Jordan Gal:So somewhere last year I came to terms with, I guess it was toward the beginning of the year of 24, I came to terms with, hey, this rally thing, it might just not work. And in that case, what should we do? We had a few million bucks in the bank, should we continue to push on? Should we close the company? Should we pivot and keep the cap table the same? So I had one of those corporate situations buy co coincidence. I was in London for a conference and I ran into a friend of ours, Justin McGill, and I’m sitting around the table with my co-founder and a few colleagues and we’re talking to Justin about his experience in ai and I have to give some credit to that conversation. It just planted a seed in the back of our minds because what we were doing is we were talking to someone who is experiencing product-market fit and all the glory and challenges of it and it reminded us of what it’s supposed to feel like. And I guess I went home thinking it’s not supposed to be this hard to grow. And I think that was the moment where I looked around and I really thought, okay, I think it’s time to make some changes. So we took the team from about 20 people down to six. We all held hands virtually and we said, do you want to keep doing this? If you want to keep doing this, I’m going to come up with another product idea and we’re going to keep the team small and we’re going to build something in ai. And if you’re in, cool, if you’re not totally understandable. So we shrunk it down to six people and I did my search around for ideas and landed on this voice agent thing and we started to build maybe May or June and then we had something functional to look at around July and then we started to bring on the first customers in August and then the first paying customers in September and now here we are in January. I think it’s really worth talking about that journey and the feature set and the decisions we made around that because in hindsight it seems to have gone really well and now we have been doubling every month for several months in a row and it’s starting to get a little serious in terms of the revenue growth. So we will blow past a million a RRR very soon. So that’s a few months worth of growth and yeah, I think it can fly. It’s a funny thing, I think this thing has wings. It’s something I repeated several times somewhere around November, December it just felt like, oh, this is how it’s supposed to feel. It’s not hard at all. Everyone just wants it and they’re pulling at you and demanding and asking and begging and want it to work. So that feeling just gave us all this confidence and energy.  Rob Walling:I remember at a certain point in the time of Drip, I think it was 2014 where all of our graphs shifted, right? It’s like churn went down, trial to paid, went up all in the right direction. And I remember pointing and telling, I think it was Derek, I said, that’s what product-market fit looks like. That’s it. And you just said a sentence that I think was similar. You kind of said this is what product-market fit feels like. I mean it sounds like this poll, this market pull, I mean it does beg the question. I ask this periodically on this podcast because question I’m going to ask you in a second because it seems like everyone has a different definition of product-market fit. We kind of know we’ll know it when we see it is what we hear often. But how did you know you had product market fair? When did you know, again, I always say it’s not a binary, it’s not a one or a zero, but when did you know you were hitting that 30 out of a hundred, 40 out of a hundred, it’s getting stronger and stronger. What was that feeling like?  Jordan Gal:It was qualitative at first and then quantitative after. So the qualitative was just the responses from people, the support chat, literally the vibe in the chat. You just hear people, oh my God, I can’t believe this is as good as it is. How do I get this here? Can you jump on the phone right now to help me this? Just very, very strong desire for it to work and to be part of their business. And then later it turned more quantitative where I was taking screenshots of profit wall grafts and posting it to rock and jazz being like, this is a joke. What is this? And then you almost start to learn more about your own product as you go. So at first when I did my projections, I put churn. I think I put churn at 15 or 20% monthly because I’m thinking this is an AI product for non-technical people and it’s not actually that good, which is one of the things that attracted me to it because I think everything in AI will be very good. And so the things that aren’t that good right now are actually the best things to build in because everyone just assumes, oh, is it a voice? Is it really going to replace a person? Yes, actually it is. But if you start now, people laugh at you and then you kind of get in the right spot for a year from now and the churn is like a fraction. And you know why? Because it’s not replacing a human. It replaces voicemail, so it just has to beat voicemail and you get ROI. And so all these things start to reveal themselves like a few weeks into having paying customers a few months later you start to basically understand your own product.  Rob Walling:Yeah, this is where you had a thesis that this was a need and it would replace a human. And like you said, you get three weeks in, you’re like, oh, it doesn’t even need to do that. This is the learning. So this is what I see separating really successful founders from those that struggle is they can both have a thesis or a hypothesis and they both build something and put it into the market and the best founders, a bunch of noise comes in, there’s a lot of noise, you’re presenting it. It was super clear. I know that it wasn’t, but you figured out the good founders figure out, they sift the noise away and there’s a bit of gut feel there. There’s a bit of conversation with team. You ask people you trust and the founders that I see, I’m not trying to make a blanket statement, but founders who struggle, they launch that and then they either don’t listen at all to the feedback and they’re like, no, my initial thesis holds or they can’t sift through it. They don’t ask for the right opinions, they don’t. You know what I mean? And it seems like you really dug through it, I guess the fact that you’re on your third one, second product-market fit, but the third time of doing this probably helped with that thought process, I’d imagine.  Jordan Gal:Sure. I think what it helps with is confidence and confidence actually allows you to say, oh, I don’t know what I’m talking about. I’m just wrong. So I learned this and move on much more so than I am definitely right, and I’m making all the right decisions because of my confidence and my experience. It’s more like when I’m on a podcast six months from today, it’s going to sound like I’m smart and I did this on purpose, but in reality I’m just kind of going with what the market and customers are telling us. Maybe that’s a good transition to talk about the feature set, which was one of the more interesting parts of the experience.  Rob Walling:Let’s do it.  Jordan Gal:Okay. So I think of this as an accordion, like out and then in, so what we did is we built a very bad version of all the features. We looked at what we thought people needed for an AI voice agent, like a receptionist that did all this stuff, that transferred calls and set appointments and connected to your CRM, answered questions, gave directions, all these different things, and we put that out there. Then we put some energy and money behind cold email because we just wanted to talk to as many people as possible immediately. So we spent money for two months to just send out 500 emails a day and that just gave us people to talk to. Then we got them into the product somewhere in August and immediately like no self-serve, no signup, no credit card, just like ugly. What happened was that we took the big feature set and went to market with it with our initial cohort, and then we immediately started to see what people actually cared about out of our call it eight features, what do people care about? It became very, very obvious that there were two or three that everyone really needed and the other ones were a nice to have. And what that allowed us to do is to then shrink back down and we removed the features, we removed them from the admin entirely. They were in code, but you couldn’t see them. And what that allowed us to do was basically identify what the features of the base plan should be. So a whole bunch of features everyone cares about these, remove all the other ones. Those are the nice to haves, the ones that people really, really need. That’s our base plan. So when we started, we didn’t have many features, so we only started with one plan. We removed the other ones. We just had a $49 a month plan. And what we came to realize was that what that is is an answering service and what the higher tiers are is the spectrum from answering service toward a receptionist. So answering service basically just takes a message. So answering questions and taking a message, that’s our base plan, that’s 49 bucks. And then as we started to grow with just the base plan, we then took those other features that were nice to haves and we added them back into the higher tiers. So it’s like we had the feature set kind of right with some changes, but we just removed all the ones that people weren’t using right away. That was our base plan. And then we added the other ones back in a fuller sense with better understanding of how people actually wanted call transfers to work or emergency things to work or sending a text message.  Rob Walling:You hear people talk about MVPs, right? It’s a minimum viable product. Usually it’s either limited functionality or it’s just not very pretty. It’s not very well built, but if it’s always a pain point, people use it. Then you hear some folks today saying, well, you can’t build an MVP anymore because everyone’s taste is too high. Or I dunno, there’s different times change, right? MVP started in almost 20 years ago now, and so it can’t be the same thesis they had then because changed. But it sounds like would, would you consider that you launched an MVP and was the accordion approach you talked about intentional or were you kind of like, well, we don’t really know, so just launch a bunch of stuff and see what sticks?  Jordan Gal:It was intentional ish. The direction of it was let’s put out a bunch of features. We don’t actually need them all. We can always remove them. So that was generally, but the actual path it took and the details not intentional, more reactive to what people told us. Now we raise money. And what that allowed us to do was basically spend on things that you normally wouldn’t spend in an MVP context. So when I called it ugly, it was functionally ugly, visually, it was not ugly. So we work with a designer called Francois from Clearly Design, highly recommend. So all of our stuff was actually pretty. Now the idea of an MVP very, very different in an AI context. Another one of the things that I’ve learned is the differences between a traditional SaaS experience and mindset and approach compared to ai. And the reason MVPs in AI and SaaS are very different things is because in AI you don’t build nearly as much as you do in SaaS. So if you want to build A CRM, you kind of can’t launch an MVP. If you want an email, for example, you can’t compete with an MVP, you’re not really going to get anywhere. But ai, you are building at the very, very top layer, the interaction layer, the app layer of whatever you want to call it, and then underneath you’re really leveraging much more infrastructure than you normally do. So yes, none of us build hosting and servers. Great. So everyone leverages that. Or maybe you have a framework like Laravel and you’re using Tailwind. So we do leverage these things, but ai, the wrapper context, you’re really leaning a lot on other services. So we don’t do the transcribing, we don’t do the voice, we don’t do the LLM in some ways, what are we actually doing? It’s just that the UI layer that allows a three person painting company to have an AI phone receptionist up and running in 10 minutes, that’s actually what we do. And in that context, an MVP much easier to build.  Rob Walling:That makes sense. That’s how you move so fast. I was going to ask you, someone listening to this who says, came up with the D in June, had something in production in July, had paying customers or something, it’s like, wow, that’s really fast. I was going to ask if you moved fast because you have money, you raised money as you said, but it sounds like it’s just a simpler product to build  Jordan Gal:And fewer people going from 20 people to six people really changed things for us and we demanded speed of ourselves. And one of the most challenging things was our development process. So at Rally being a checkout your development process and QA super strict because you can’t mess up, you can’t mess anything up in production or you cost your customers money and lose their trust. So we had a specifically built very tedious, careful development process and deployment process. And then when we went to Rosie, we had to say, we are going to destroy 90% of our process. We have to intentionally set it on fire. It’s a real challenge for our product leader, Jessica. But she’s done extremely well with it because she wasn’t ideological about the process, she was just like, well, that product needed X, this product needs y, let’s change. So a lot of the speed is attributable to that.  Rob Walling:And you’ve kind of mentioned or hinted that AI rappers wrapping ai, I don’t know, AI wrappers like a bad term now. It’s like, oh, if you build an AI wrapper, you have no defensible mode or whatever. Do you think of what you’re building? Would you call it an AI rapper? Is it something different? And how do you think about that moat? Could me and a team of people compete with you in two or three months?  Jordan Gal:It’s shorthand and it’s useful even if I don’t actually think of us as a rapper. I think the conversation changed for the healthier with deep seek because it poked a hole in the potential value. The flip side of this, the commoditization of the LLMs. And so it put a lot more focus and attention on the application layer, and I think it evened out the debate a little bit. It’s not one sided. You can make money or get crushed all up and down the stack. So I don’t necessarily think of us as an AI wrapper and there will be a lot of competition for sure, but there’s still a very honest dynamic between service and customer. If you provide value and you continue providing value, people will stick with you. So what if there’s competition?  Rob Walling:So it’s a bit of a, I would almost call it a land grab right now of the more customers you get in a short amount of time, they are unlikely to switch if what you have is working, right?  Jordan Gal:That’s right. I forget who said it, it was a great term. I don’t know if I can remember the term correctly, but it was like UI commitment or dedication or  Rob Walling:To where someone gets used to using your app. And especially with non-technical folks, my parents are older and they don’t, man. They learn exactly. They learn exactly which button to click. So that’s what you’re referring to is like, Hey, you’re an electrician or a lawn care person. And stereotypically they don’t want to learn a new ui.  Jordan Gal:I have some very funny conversations on Twitter with technical people who are like, this can be done so much cheaper. I’m like, yes, you keep having that conversation, go for it. That is the same reason why if you go to our site, we have not taken on a vertical normally in SaaS. What would you and I recommend to ourselves and to other people? Don’t try to be broad for everybody. Find a niche. The niches are big enough, I kill it for one type of customer, then expand. And this, I think it’s the exact opposite. So I see a lot of competitors doing really well, very niched, ai, voice for veterinary clinics, ai, voice for doctor’s offices, ai, voice for restaurants and so on. And I think it’s just not the right time for that. I think one of the more interesting aspects of building an AI in general is that new markets are forming. If you think about our market, the phone, gigantic problem, enormous problem answering the phone, dealing with it, not missing phone calls, just gigantic. It’s very rare in our economy that you have that size of a problem and there are no solutions. That is just rare. And it only happens in this context because that solution wasn’t possible. So before you had voicemail and you had answering services that people pay two bucks a minute for and are generally not that happy about. So now all of a sudden this third option comes around that’s going to get filled in by competition. I think that land grab slash demand rush calls for being very wide and horizontal and everyone’s welcome and this is easy to get started with. It’s against specialization in many ways. We’ll see if in hindsight, that’s a good call in about a year, but we’ll see.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and I want to call out, as you said, it’s rare that there are problems that are huge that have no solution because people see money. Big companies are smart, they’re dumb and they’re smart, but they do see big money and they’ll move into a space. And so everything’s crowded in quotes, but these technological shifts move all of it and make it possible. The internet did this. The worldwide web, when it came about, it was suddenly like, oh no, this can do all. And social media was another one I think of even Web 2.0, email the iPhone, yes. Remember the iPhone coming out suddenly there was this huge rush. Even remember Facebook apps that was a big rush, VR that didn’t pan out the way. Drones, ai, crypto, and some of these panned out and some didn’t. But they at least created this space that suddenly there was a lot that could happen that wasn’t possible last  Jordan Gal:Year. And the key is that there’s demand for it because crypto feels like a huge innovation, not much demand outside of gambling, but AI is different. So I do think about the email context a lot. If email comes out, are you building Drip or are you building constant contact, right? If it first comes out, you don’t need to go niche in specialty, you just go, Hey, we’re MailChimp man, it’s everybody.  Rob Walling:And it’s simple. And I think Constant Contact might’ve been the first, or it’s kind of the first one that’s still around. An AWeber was the first one to do sequences of emails is my memory. And these are, we’re talking like 99 talk about early and they were so simple and they’re built in Pearl and they’re hosted on a server rack in downtown Manhattan in a cage, and you have to go, you know what I mean? It’s that stuff,  Jordan Gal:Yeah, crazy.  Rob Walling:And you have to raise half a million dollars just to get the thing built and deployed, but it didn’t need to be Drip. It didn’t need to be complicated at all. There were no workflows, you didn’t need ’em. And if you could just communicate with an audience, you could build it. I want to circle back to something you said earlier. I know someone listening to this is thinking about it, you built a bunch of, you built eight features you said, and then you’re just like, voop five gone up in the premium. Did anyone complain? Because I know that there’s someone listening being like, Ooh, everyone’s going to be mad when I take their stuff away that they’re paying for  Jordan Gal:In software. We have a lot more flexibility than we think we do, whether it’s raising prices, taking features away, or just coming up with other solutions. So what we did, let’s say for the call transfers, we just asked people, do you want to keep using it? We’re about to take it away. Do you want to keep using it? And they said, yes, we just flagged it. Okay, fine, you can still see that link. That’s it. Move on. They just knew that we weren’t going to support it and it wasn’t going to be good, but they were like, I love it so much, I want it. And we said, cool, we’ll come back to you with a better version of it in two months right now it’s going to go away for everyone else, it’s going to stay for you. And so in our admin individual features literally have their own links, so we just remove the link, simple as that. That’s actually how we reintroduce them also is we would email people and say, do you want to try the new call transfers? And they’d say, yes, we just give ’em a URL and then they would just go there directly from the URL.  Rob Walling:I like that idea of, because we used to do that all the time. Feature flags were such a popular thing when we were trying to, I say popular, we used them all the time in Drip to figure out for testing and for this type of stuff. There were features we built RSS to email is I hate that feature. And we built it because there were some early power users that were like, oh, if you just had this, I would switch from X, Y, Z. And I’m like, I will never use it. I don’t endorse that feature. It’s a pain in the ass. It’s brittle as hell, but I’m going to build it for you five because I knew then they would then talk about it. So we have a feature flag and I bet probably tens of thousands of users of Drip at this point and I bet there’s like a hundred that have that enabled, right? And that’s the thing, you’re going for tens of thousands of paying customers. I mean that’s your goal, right? Because tell people about your price points.  Jordan Gal:Sure, we’re at 49 point 99 and 199 and we have some weird issues around minute usage because our cogs are directly tied to minute usage usually. I don’t even like to think about cogs in the software context because normally cart hooks like 5,000 bucks for AWS for $500,000 in revenue. This is not that. It’s more linear and I don’t like it because people think of us as minutes. They say, do my minutes roll over. As soon as I heard that, I was like, we got to get away from this minutes thing. We want to focus on value, not the number of minutes. The pricing has been good to us so far. So in December we launched our self-serve onboarding and that was the turning point. So up until then it was do we have it right, do we have the feature set, do we have the price? Do we have all this other stuff? But it was ugly to help to get people onboarded and we purposely did not build the onboarding because we assumed we don’t know what the onboarding should be. So once we understood the base plan feature set, we looked at it and said, out of these base plan features, what is absolutely necessary to get any value at all? And we built that into the onboarding. What is the minimum number of things you need to do to just get value from this thing? And that’s what our onboarding is. The other part of our onboarding, I learned this from Justin McGill actually, was to take the value that’s in the admin and drag it out into the marketing experience so that it starts there. Instead of saying, here’s a wall that you need to get over to get value, AI has this opportunity. You see with CHATT PT, you see it with Midjourney, you just come into this product, you type something, boom, you have value. So I felt we needed to provide that type of an experience. So if you go to our site, the onboarding is actually part of the signup process. So it’s not, if you want value, get over this hurdle of creating an account. Instead it is come in, give us a bit of information about your business. So Google business profile is our primary path. Our secondary path is your website. Our third path is your, just give us a business name, but the primary path gets taken 80% of the time you put in your Google business profile, we pull your information, it’s very structured data in Google, and then the next thing you see is your AI voice agent and you have a few clips and you can just hit play and it’ll say, thanks for calling Pet Busters in Illinois. How can we help you today? So you get a little taste of the value upfront and then we ask you to create an account. And then when you get to the onboarding, we’ve already ingested your website, Google Business profile, all your information, your business hours, all this stuff, and you’re like, whoa, I’m almost done. So that onboarding is kind of what changed the trajectory. And we just put the other features at the third step and just said, keep exploring. So you get through the onboarding, you get the value, you get a phone number, you can call your agent and you are blown away in less than three minutes. You are a painter somewhere in the suburbs of Illinois and you sign up on your phone while you’re in your truck and within three minutes you’re like, holy cow, I have this thing. I made this thing, it knows my business and can answer my phone. And that creates enough desire to get through the last part of onboarding, which is actually forwarding your phone calls to us.  Rob Walling:And as someone you who built Cart Hook, that ran rally that required the onboarding was not three minutes to see value. No, the onboarding was extensive and it was often getting developers, right? Right. So you’ve seen both sides of it. I see both sides of it with TinySeed companies. You are in an incredibly luxurious position right now. I mean, I’m blown away. Three minute onboarding, that’s amazing. If you can do it, do you wake up every day and pinch yourself and think this is it? This is great.  Jordan Gal:So this is one of the few things that I can actually say was completely deliberate and it was a reaction to pain card hook was pain rally in terms of onboarding pain. And one of the requirements in this product was self-serve. And I think that has served us well because voice and AI is really, really powerful. And when something’s really powerful, you’re tempted to bring all that power to the user and that’s what creates onboarding friction. So a lot of our competitors are sign up for a demo or build this visual workflow and choose your AI model. And we were like absolutely not under five minutes to value and to onboarding. So that was very deliberate and it does feel incredible. Part of the product-market Fit Sense came after we launched self-serve and we watched completely non-technical people sign up, get their phone number, make a phone call and then put their credit card in. So we put the credit card on the other side of testing your agent. One of the more important experiences we had was around pricing. So maybe it’s worth kind of taking a little detour into that. That kind of surprised us in general. When we first started, we had a seven day trial with a credit card required, and for the first few weeks we looked like geniuses because everyone was converting. Seven days goes by your credit card on file, you convert and it felt good. And then we looked under the hood at the usage and I was like, we are building our castle on quicksand, not even sand like wet quicksand. And it’s because people weren’t using it. So what we did is we switched from a seven day trial to a 25 minute trial, and what that did is it went from time to usage based. So now everyone that converts is an activated user that’s already converted their behavior, which is partly why our churn is so, so low, no one’s converting that isn’t using it.  Rob Walling:That’s the thing usually with a lot of SaaS credit card upfront, the first 30 or 60 days, the churn is a lot higher and then it drops way down because people are using it as an extended trial.  Jordan Gal:Yes, they want to try, fine, I’ll pay you the 50 bucks because I’m so interested in this. Let’s see if it works. We flipped it on its head and that has made everything much, much healthier. And so when we did that, we took the credit card requirement away from the onboarding and we put it on the end of the onboarding as an optional step. And so to see someone come in self-serve, make a phone call, and then put the credit card in means they were impressed enough that they said, I don’t want this to go away. I’m going to put my credit card in even if it’s not required. And then 25 minutes goes by and then they convert and all of a sudden we have a real user as opposed to, Hey, seven days has gone by and now we have more revenue.  Rob Walling:And for folks listening, 25 minutes is not a linear time, it’s minutes of talk time, talk time, it’s someone calling in and it’s 25 minutes of interacting with Rosie. Yeah,  Jordan Gal:It can be one day or 30 days. I didn’t care. I thought the numbers would kind of even out. And so it would kind of reveal itself to effectively be a six day trial or whatever else.  Rob Walling:Now here’s the interesting thing you said, building a healthier business by doing this because you’re making sure that only that the people who convert are only those who are actively using it. But if you didn’t do that, if you just did the credit card in the seven day, you’d have more revenue right now you’d grow faster significantly as a founder, how do you wrestle with that? Is it just long-term the right decision or how do you internally think, boy, let’s say you said you’re doubling every month. You could be quadrupling every month literally, and that is pretty tantalizing, right? That’s actually what we see with some of the big Silicon Valley companies, the payment process or not Bolt AI where they raise all this money and they’re trying to dah, dah, dah, and then they just crash and burn, right? So how do you reconcile that as a founder who’s ambitious, you want to grow as fast as possible, but you’re like, well, I’m going to not put the pedal to the metal. I think it’s an unhealthy business.  Jordan Gal:So maybe two things. I think the most important thing is we saw it as an experiment. We did not say we’re changing the way the whole thing works and we’re taking this big gamble to build a healthier business. We were like, let’s just give it a 30 days and see if that works out better. So that made the decision to go into it lighter. The second part of that is I have seen what churn does and I have Googled maximum churn given growth rate and  Rob Walling:It’s not good. Yeah,  Jordan Gal:It’s not good. If anyone doesn’t know what I’m talking about, there is a formula for your maximum MRR given your growth and your churn and you do not care about it at 50 KMRR, at 300 KMRR, you really care that your maximum is three 50 because here we are, the wall has arrived at card hook. We found the wall because we were churning at 15, 15% a month. So we were skyrocketing but churning like crazy. I called it a washing machine. And if you recall, what I did is I went to the support team and I said, what percentage of your interactions are with people that will not become paying customers? And they were like, at least 50% at least. And I was like, that’s an absolute disaster not only for the support team, but also because we’re wasting time on people that don’t care as much and we’re not giving time to the best people. So that really gnarly decision at card hook to force a demo and only take on people that we thought were right and raise prices at the same time, that taught me you actually are better off building a better business as opposed to a faster business. So I was more open to it than we saw it as an experiment and it worked. And then there’s, there’s one final step in the process that just came out I think earlier this month in February that has again changed the trajectory again and that was what we call premium ui. So up until the beginning of this month, you looked at the feature set on the marketing site and on the pricing page, and then you signed up and you just didn’t see the premium features. You would basically have to ask us, Hey, that call transferring thing or this custom training, can I hear more about that? And then we would say, yes, that requires this higher tier. So we had no mechanism for people to discover the higher tiers instead of just jamming it in there. We very deliberately went with the designer and a product team and said, how do we make this not only incredibly attractive but also self-serve? Now you go through the onboarding and that third step, the keep exploring is now expanded. And as you navigate the admin, there are individual elements with a little yellow star and you click on those and we reveal the feature and we clearly state this is a premium feature that requires these plans. Do you want to use it? Here’s what will happen. And building that self-serve, now we have a mechanism for increasing arpu. So now everyone comes in at the base tier at the $49 tier, and now the percentage we’re almost at 50% of our revenue is now at the higher tiers. And then that starts to argue for expanding the strategy around that lower tier. Do we have a free tier? Do we lower it to 29? Now that we have more confidence around a self-serve revenue expansion, now it starts to factor into our marketing plans and our advertising and our positioning and pricing and all that.  Rob Walling:Man, I’m looking forward to following this story both through investor updates and having you back on the show in, I don’t know, six or 12 months to kind of follow up because everything changes. I mean, if you look back at the past five or six months, it’s changed dramatically for you. And I imagine building in AI in that world, things are going to change quick for you again,  Jordan Gal:Yes. I just sent a tweet out yesterday that encapsulates this extreme optimism and paranoia. I think that is the appropriate stance for the CEO of this company is we are going to push so hard, we’re going to crush it, we’re going to get to 10 million ARR in 18 months, and at the same time at any minute, someone could release something, someone could do something like, so we have to hurry. And I think ai, that’s what founders in this space right now are feeling. No one should be overconfident about anything. Unless you’re lovable and you got the 17 million a RR in three months, then you’re fine. Be comfortable. There you are.  Rob Walling:Yeah. So folks want to read that tweet. They can head to Jordan Gaal, that’s GAL on Twitter. And of course if they want to check out Rosie, what we’ve been talking about for the past 30 minutes, the AI answering service for your business calls, they can head to, Hey rosie.com. Jordan, thanks so much for joining me. Thank you very much. I want to give thanks again to Jordan for coming on the show and sharing his wisdom. He is a founder that executes, and oftentimes when I’m saying on this show, the founders I know who succeed, do X, Y, and Z, he’s one of those founders that I think about. He is, if you know coding, he’s a design pattern for doing smart things, executing well, getting done, moving fast, a little bit of gut, a little bit of data, and being super scrappy and making it work. So it’s always great to have Jordan on the show and I hope you enjoyed the conversation.

This is season four, episode eight, the penultimate episode where we hear Colleen Schneller with her back to the wall as she’s trying to find product-market fit. Before we dive into this episode, I want to tell you about SaaS Launchpad. This is the best course I’ve ever created, and it is the best course that I know of early stage SaaS founders. You can get it at SaaS launchpad.co, and if you head there, you can download for free one of the videos. I think there’s 26 or 27 different videos, almost 10 hours of content, and you can download one of ’em for free to get a taste of the content. But this is the meatiest most prescriptive course for early stage SaaS founders that I know of my team and I spent, I’ll tell you what, I thought it was going to be about three months, and I think we wound up spending 10 or 11 months outlining recording, editing, producing. It is very dense with material. We have amazing guests like Derek Reimer Lee, Anna Patch, Ruben Gomez, Ross Hudgens, bunch of names that we really enjoyed building the course, and it’s getting rave reviews from the hundreds of folks who have purchased it. So SaaS launchpad.co. If you’re interested, let’s dive in to TinySeed Tails.  Colleen Schnettler:The product is totally different, but the job to be done is the same, and we couldn’t make that first product really work the way we want it to, but this feels very doable with the tech that I already have.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. We’re now in episode eight with developer and entrepreneur, Colleen Schneller. The last time we chatted with Colleen, she decided to make some changes. It no longer made sense to cater to engineering managers, so she decided to shift her focus to helping marketers, which caused its own frustration since the market was pretty crowded,  Colleen Schnettler:I was going all in on marketing data analyst. I think I mentioned this last episode, but doing the whole cold LinkedIn DM thing, started a newsletter, targeted those people, built a guide and engaged as many of those people as I could in actual conversation. I had honestly, kind of an abysmal response rate from my cold LinkedIn outreach. I don’t know if that’s because marketers are just overwhelmed with choice, but it wasn’t great. The few people I did get on the phone, they aren’t using their database as a tool to provide any kind of signal, so they have many, many different data sources. They’re almost overwhelmed with data sources, but one of those data sources is not the database  Rob Walling:That makes sense. So they have all these tools, these Mixpanel or product analytics or even I imagine tracking incoming conversions from ads and SEO and all that. And yeah, none of that’s all third party data.  Colleen Schnettler:There was some interest, but it was more of a, that would be nice to have. There was no, this is absolutely something I need to do my job. And a lot of them are using data aggregators like a segment or something like that, and those tools just pretty much pull in your data from all these different sources, try to aggregate it. Some people use big queries, so they are using databases, they’re just not using their main or primary database,  Rob Walling:And so would an approach there be to do a bunch of integrations and pull that data in and aggregate it?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I thought about that. That was one of the things I looked at because I could be an aggregator, I could sit on top of BigQuery, but learning more about that, it’s pretty tricky. I actually have a founder friend, and that’s what his business literally does, and maintaining those integrations can be really, really painful. So without, again, it comes down to I would totally build that if I thought it would work, but I don’t have any kind of unique take on it that all of these other data aggregators, I’m not like, oh, I’ve seen this one hole in the market and I’m going to solve it. There was nothing like that. It was like, this is a space. There’s a lot of players in this space. Most people use Segment. Can you build something better? And not being a marketer, I think this is where maybe the fact that I’m just learning marketing that is both helpful and harmful, it’s helpful because I’m approaching it with beginner eyes, so I’m able to kind of see things people take as kind of just ground truth, but also it’s hurtful because I don’t have deep industry knowledge, so I can’t say this is the very specific problem that is wrong with Segment. Here is how I can solve it,  Rob Walling:And it’s hard to enter a competitive crowded space when you don’t have an obvious position. That’s  Colleen Schnettler:On my it’s, I mean, it’s just not worth it without having 30 people saying, yes, I need this one very specific thing. So I saw a lot of people’s problems even getting segment data. One person I spoke with walked me through getting his segment data into Big Query and all this custom stuff he had to do, but that was, I couldn’t see how that wasn’t just an isolated problem he had because of his unique data structure.  Rob Walling:And that’s one of the hard parts about all of this is there’s so much noise among the signal. Sometimes all the signal is kind of noise. Talk to 10 people, they tell you 10 different things. It’s like, you told me to talk to my customers. What do I build now? You can’t build what they all said because 10 different products. So where did that lead you? Where does it stand? Where does hell query stand today?  Colleen Schnettler:The one thing that the marketers did seem to have in common was a general hatred for GA four, and so I kind of went down the GA four path for a while to learn more about that space to see if there was something I could build on top of GA four. But again, what I learned there was I wasn’t a power user of Universal Analytics, so I can’t say there’s this one feature in universal analytics I really miss that I want to build out in GA four. So anyway, I didn’t think I was the right person to build a GA four wrapper, for example, although I spent some time investigating it to see if that was the right choice. I don’t have a strong enough opinion about what I would want in that kind of a product, like what Data insights are not being surfaced. And so I did not think that was the right direction to go.  Rob Walling:Eventually though Colleen did find a new direction, one that led her towards an epiphany. She found a new customer who wanted to pull their own data. This had a reconsidering an idea that she had tabled in the past.  Colleen Schnettler:The product is totally different, but the job to be done is the same, and we couldn’t make that first product really work the way we want it to. Why that is, it’s neither here nor there, but this feels very doable with the tech that I already have. So it’s ambitious, but it is full circle and it is something I can build, and I have someone who will pay me for it, so I’m going to do it.  Rob Walling:That’s crazy. How much will he be paying you for it?  Colleen Schnettler:One 50 a month.  Rob Walling:A hundred. And you already have a customer paying you 60, right? 59?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah. Well, they’re both. So now I have two customers paying me 60 bucks a month.  Rob Walling:Got it.  Colleen Schnettler:And this guy told me he’ll upgrade once I have this SSO embedded features,  Rob Walling:It’s going to be at $210 of  Colleen Schnettler:MRR  Rob Walling:Soon. That’s got to feel good. Two customers though, for, I mean, it does Rob. It does feel good. I know. I know. We’re laughing because it’s true, because it is been a long journey. So here’s the interesting thing. When you were going to build, or you built the query builder back in episode one and two, there was something with where embedding it in an app was going to be complicated because it doesn’t look and feel like their app and it’s like, Ooh, it’s really hard to make it, but now it’s just a text box, right? I mean, it is a tabular display of stuff, but  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, so the biggest difference is, I mean, it’s a completely different product, but yeah, the UI will be less just because it’s less obtrusive in terms of what the UI is versus what we were looking at building first.  Rob Walling:A while back, Colleen mentioned she had six months of runway until she ran out of funding, which would’ve taken her through December, just three months from when we were having this conversation. I wanted to check in and see how she was feeling about that timeline.  Colleen Schnettler:I have mixed feelings about it. This whole season of this podcast shows a really real journey, and unfortunately it just hasn’t gone the way I thought it would, and man, but I don’t want to do anything else. And that’s the weirdest thing, because before I got into TinySeed and before we got that initial big contract, it just seemed inevitable that this was going to work. There’s nothing I will outwork anyone. I will do anything. I am coachable. I have all of the skills, literally all the skills to make this work. So the trajectory that it’s taken, which is really not working, is a super bummer. But also, I don’t want to do anything else. So I do think I’m going to stick. So for this business, and it might be this is the wrong business, everyone, and you can speak to this, everyone who has found product-market fit says you will know when you are building something people want, you will know. So I can tell you right now for sure, that is not happening to me. I am not building something people want. I am cold calling and trying to get people onboarded, and it’s like just pushing this boulder up the hill. You want this thing, you want this thing. And I’m not. So this last pivot to customer facing, this is my last pivot on this business. So one thing I don’t want, and I know a lot of people who do this, and that’s fine for them, but I don’t want a side project that goes on for five years making no money or little bit of money. Oh, it’s making $200 a month. I should keep it up. No, I’m here to go big or go home. I’m kind of an intense person. I am all in. So yeah, so that’s why I’m giving myself till the end of the year, I have a specific goal of where I want to be by the end of December. And if I’m not there, then I’m just going to walk away.  Rob Walling:And it’s really good to have that clarity because otherwise, how do you answer that question of when to quit? When do I quit? I get this question all the time, right on the podcast, people ask you, and it’s like, it sounds like you’re pretty clear on knowing when to quit that it’s not today. It’s either end of December or it’s not depending on this kill criteria. So I dunno if you’ve read the book, quit by Annie Duke. There were a couple things in it that I took away from, and one is kill criteria. Knowing when to quit and kill criteria involves a date and some type of number usually or some type of milestone that if you haven’t hit this by that date, then it’s done and you can adjust along the way, of course as you get new information. But that’s exactly what you’ve defined. Here is a date and a number,  Colleen Schnettler:And I decided I need to do that because I do want to. I want this to work so badly. So that’s why I kind of gave myself those guardrails to be like, if you’ve been doing this for two years and it’s still not working, and to be fair, a lot happened in there and we sold the other thing, but that’s probably a sign. It’s not the right thing. You’re not working on the right thing.  Rob Walling:And I say this the time that this is the hardest part, or at least I guess it’s the hardest part mentally, I think because you just don’t know and no one can tell you, I can’t sit here and say, oh, you should definitely take this approach or this direction because none of us know you’re trying to do something novel. And this is one of the hard parts of entrepreneurship is that fuzzy time before product-market fit. But as you start building something, people want your product matures, 5K, 10 KMRR, things become clearer. And then by the time you hit 50 KMR, it’s really clear what you’re building, who you’re building it for. It should be, unless you’re really getting lucky, which can happen. But this part’s fuzzy. This part is hard to even prescribe. The frameworks for it are really loose. I mean, to talk about customer development or lean startup or I have this course in this book called SaaS Launchpad. I get as tight as I can with it, but I can’t be as prescriptive as I can. If you were to come and be like, Hey, I’m a 20 KMRR and I have 20 customers or 30 whatever, and I can be like, oh, great, I can playbook the out of this. I know the next steps. I can almost blueprint this out if exactly what I would do in which order of blah, blah, blah. But where you’re at is just like you’re just searching. You’re trying to find it. You’re using Founder Gut and you’re making a lot of hard decisions with incomplete information. A ton of noise.  Colleen Schnettler:Lots of noise. I mean, I haven’t talked to you in a couple months. So one of the things I tried in that gap was going after product people. And I mentioned that the marketing people didn’t really want to talk to me. The product people all wanted to talk to me. I got on so many calls and Rob, there were several people that I was sure a hundred percent sure they were going to sign up and try it out. And I just got ghosted so hard by these people so hard. So yeah, I don’t know. It’s a messy, weird middle ground. To your point, signal to noise getting on these calls, these people were like, yes, I need this to make product decisions a hundred percent. And just disappeared. Won’t respond to emails, won’t respond to LinkedIn. Messages just gone poof.  Rob Walling:Those are the road. Those are the speed bumps that you encounter. You can let ’em be roadblocks or you can just let ’em be Speed bumps, keep driving, pivot.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I mean, there’s just filtering that out at this stage. It’s just trying to filter that stuff out. It’s trying to figure out what people really want, what’s actually useful, and really defining that value prop for people, which even now with what I have, isn’t crazy clear. Even to me. I have a big sales demo on Monday for a big company, and I’m sitting here thinking, what is the one thing that I can show them? And I’m like, this is the thing you need. This is why you reached out to me. This is the thing. So even defining all of that, it’s messy and it’s hard, and you’re kind of building and showing people and building and showing people, and you kind of hope, or at least that’s how I work. I hope to iterate my way to the correct.  Rob Walling:As the end of Colleen’s runway approaches, she’ll have a lot to consider. Can she hone her value prop and find a bit of traction with a handful of paying customers in order to extend her runway? That’s next time on TinySeed Tails.","PublishedAt":"March 6, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-763-tinyseed-tales-s4e8-one-last-pivot"},{"Title":"Episode 762 | Doing Great Work, Hierarchy of SaaS Skills, and Public Deadlines (A Rob Solo Adventure)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 762 | Doing Great Work, Hierarchy of SaaS Skills, and Public Deadlines (A Rob Solo Adventure)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25:05\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 25:05 | Recorded on March 4, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nAre public deadlines a double-edged sword for startup founders?\n\n\n\nIn episode 762, join Rob Walling for a solo adventure where he covers several topics.

I am your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I’m on a solo adventure where I’m going to walk through Paul Graham’s, I was going to say recent essay, but it’s over a year old now. It’s called Doing Great Work. I think it’s a fascinating look at the steps that it takes to ship amazing things and to build incredible things on this planet. And I’m going to focus that a little bit more on being an ambitious Bootstrapper rather than Paul. Graham thinks of things like probably Airbnb and what DoorDash did they invest in or Instacart, these really kind of game changing apps that everyone winds up using. But for the purpose of this podcast, we want to build real businesses for real customers that pay us real money, which look Stripe and DoorDash and those actually are as well, but that’s not the focus of this show, and so I’m going to edge that or focus it more on things that relate to what you are probably building. Then I’m going to talk about whether there’s a hierarchy to skills If you’re building a SaaS, this is based on an X Twitter conversation and dive in to a couple other solo topics. But before I do that, applications for MicroConf Connect, which is our online community and forum are open today and they close March 5th. Since we do custom group onboarding for new connect applications, we take folks in batches once every month, and if you get in now, you will have access to our MicroConf Connect live session, which happens next month in March with Asia Gio. She’s going to be talking about, well, all types of amazing stuff that Asia talks about. So if you’re interested in potentially becoming part of MicroConf Connect, do you want to dip your toe in the water MicroConf connect.com? It’s only open for a few more days and closes on March 5th. Let’s dive in to my first topic. I’m going to link up this essay, how to Do Great Work by Paul Graham, and when I noted down this essay, I put a couple bullet points. I said, doing great work isn’t easy and you must be ambitious and hardworking to even consider it. Paul Graham has four steps to do great work, and he says, this is how practically everyone who’s ever done great work has done it from painters to physicists, and obviously he includes startup founders in this, I would assume. So step one is to decide what to work on. Step two is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. The third step is notice the knowledge gaps, and the fourth step is boldly chase outlier ideas. And the reason I wanted to talk about this in this episode is whatever you are building, whether it’s a lifestyle business or an ambitious SaaS startup, I think the first three steps probably apply to that. But the fourth step of boldly chasing outlier ideas I think only applies if you want to build really ambitious products or companies that get really big, but deciding what to work on, learning enough about it that you get to one of the frontiers of knowledge and then noticing the knowledge gaps to me is a fundamental part of building something that other people will value and businesses will pay for. It’s extremely rare that someone gets so lucky that they enter a domain or a space or a vertical and they build something right from the start without learning enough about it to get to the frontiers of knowledge and then noticing the knowledge gaps and they’re right. It’s kind of like trying to hit a bullseye on a dartboard or it’s kind of like trying to roll a particular number of 57 on a 100 sided die, maybe even a 500 sided die. They don’t make those. I have a 100 sided die and it’s almost like a golf ball, so you roll it, it just rolls forever. It’s so much easier to roll 2D tens, but I digress. The idea of you coming into a domain that you don’t understand and seeing a huge gap without first getting the frontiers of knowledge and noticing those knowledge gaps is a one in 1,001 in 10,000. This is the thing I see people try to shortcut and they don’t try to shortcut it by learning and getting to the knowledge gaps faster. What they instead try to do is build a bunch of bullshit and throw it against the wall to see what sticks, thinking that if they launch a hundred or a thousand products, that one of those is going to magically take off through sheer luck, and I think that’s a terrible game plan. I hate relying on luck because as much as we can say the harder you work luckier you get or you make your own luck by trying a lot of things and putting in a lot of time and developing skills and working hard. As much as we can say that, and as much as I believe that you can’t control luck, and I’ve seen more than one, and by that I mean dozens upon dozens of companies just get sides swiped because they were unlucky platform risk competitors. I’ve told stories on this podcast about people getting unlucky and then about folks who got lucky, A friend of mine who’s sold his business for $20 million literally and always says, I just didn’t work that hard. I got really lucky. I hit things at the right time. Don’t rely on that because almost no one succeeds, mostly based on luck. So what I want to encourage you to do as you think about building a product is decide what to work on, then learn enough about it that you get to one of the frontiers of knowledge and then notice the knowledge gaps. I’m going to give you an example of this. When we built Drip back in 2012, I knew that email marketing was a cornerstone of every business that I had built up until then, including software businesses I had built, including my consulting days. I maintained an email list of interested people including launching my first book, start Small, stay Small, including launching MicroConf. All of those relied so heavily on an email list, and I knew that email marketing could be better, could be easier to use. It could have a built-in JavaScript widget that allowed you to easily place it on every page of a website, some basic things. I decided what to work on, and then I learned enough about it that I was like, oh yeah, there’s no easy JavaScript widget. That’s the gap in this market. And so Paul Graham talks about knowledge gaps. I actually think there’s positioning or kind of market gaps. And then what we learned after we launched is that there was actually a massive gap in marketing automation, which is a term I had never heard, didn’t know what it meant. People started saying, Hey, are you trying to unseat these big marketing automation providers like Infusionsoft, Marketo, Pardot, Silverpop, there’s a bunch of others, but what we now know today as just email marketing was much simpler back then. And so it took me a while to wrestle with this to reorient the company around. We are going to become a lightweight marketing automation tool, but eventually I decided what I wanted to work on and then I had to educate myself on marketing automation. I had never used any of those marketing automation tools. I had never even logged into one. And there were folks like Brennan Dunn giving me advice because he, I believe had an Infusionsoft account. Keith Ack had an Infusionsoft account, he’s a founder of semetrics now funded by TinySeed, and I remember literally emailing him saying, we’re thinking about building these automations. How do they work in Infusionsoft? Infusionsoft, by the way, renamed itself keep, and they recently sold the private equity for less than one XARR multiple because they didn’t have, they just stopped growing. They weren’t releasing software fast enough and they didn’t keep up with the market product-market fit drifts. And so what I realized was, and it was, I mean it was a hard realization. I am not saying in retrospect, I was a hundred percent and I knew it was just this amazing thing that I was totally convinced of. I was trying to learn enough about it to get to the frontiers of knowledge, and I was noticing the knowledge gaps and the knowledge gaps in this case were, they were positioned upmarket. They were charging way more money than you needed to still make a lot of money as a software company, and their sales process was terrible. They locked you into one year contracts. They had a mandatory upfront $2,000 fee. People hated it, but there was no alternative. And at the time, I didn’t want to build a marketing automation platform. I didn’t really know what it was. It sounded really boring. It sounded like a lot of work, to be honest. I’ve never been afraid of hard work, but I thought that it would be a tough business. There was a lot of competition and there were a lot of things going on in that space. And so Paul Graham’s fourth step is boldly Chase outlier ideas. Now, let’s be honest, drip is not nearly as much of an outlier idea as Uber or WeWork or even Stripe or Facebook or Google. There’s different levels of outlier idea, but eventually I did a ton of soul searching and I came to grips with the fact that pivoting Drip and becoming full blown email marketing was already in the works. Derek and I had talked a lot about that, and it just made sense. It’s like, oh, I think that’s a legit need in the market, but the idea of going full-blown into marketing automation and adding all the automations and the triggers and the actions and all that was something we really had to wrestle with. That’s just one example. There are literally dozens and dozens within the TinySeed portfolio, 192 companies, and I would guess they’re 40, 50, maybe more. It’s probably even more than that maybe is it even a hundred of founders who learned enough about a domain and whether they learned about that working a day job, whether they learned about that on their own by doing cold calls and interviews, whether they had a brother-in-law or their aunt who had this issue at work, they didn’t just hear about that and go build it and hey, everything worked. They had to decide to work on it. They had to learn enough about it to get to the forefront of the knowledge, and they had the notice, the knowledge or the positioning or the market gaps. All of these things take time and patience and skill, and when I say it takes time, maybe it takes you three months to get there or maybe it takes you a couple of years. If you think about the first line of code that Derek wrote for Drip was December of 2012. We had a first paying customer, I believe June of 2013, so it was about seven months later. We launched to the world in November because we did a staged or phased launch across our 3,400 emails that were on our list. And then we did not find what I would consider product-market fit until August or September of 2014, so it was almost two years from the first line of code until I would say week plus plus product-market fit. Product-market fit is not a binary, it’s a continuum, but we found that after a couple years because it took us a ton of time to learn about the space and the market to get to the frontiers of knowledge and to notice the knowledge, the positioning, and the market gaps. So am I saying you have to commit to an idea from day one and it’s going to take you two years to get to product-market fit? No, none of that, right? The story is just to illustrate that. Oftentimes if you want to do great work, if you want to build something interesting and ambitious, and again, ambitious for us, what is that 5,000,025 million a RR? It’s different than Paul Graham’s definition, but if you want to do that, you’re not going to do that by building a much small projects and throwing against the wall to see what sticks because you don’t have the knowledge and the understanding of where to take it. And you do have to put in hard work and develop skills and maybe get a little lucky to build great things. My second topic for today comes from an X Twitter conversation. Looks like it happened back in August of 2023, so it’s still relevant. Alexander Schnebel asks, do you believe someone with x plus years of experience as a software engineer has an unfair advantage when bootstrapping a business compared to someone who doesn’t? And I responded to Alexander and said, they have an advantage, but it’s fair they put in the time to build that skill. Someone with software engineering plus hiring slash managing experience is better off someone with those plus marketing or sales has even more of an advantage. And that exchange got me thinking about is there a hierarchy? Would I put one skillset at the top? And specifically he says when building a business, I mean when building a SaaS company. And so I started thinking, there’s engineering skills where you can build software. There’s marketing and sales, there’s what we could name, how many skills, a lot different departments, customer success or great skill, customer service. Those are important, but they’re certainly less important to going from zero to one with a SaaS company. And so I gave it some thought and I picked the four most important skills based on my criteria and how I see people succeeding and I put ’em in order. The number one is marketing or sales, and I say marketing or sales because if you have a low touch funnel and folks are mostly self-service, then it’s marketing because you need to drive a lot of traffic and you need to build an incredible funnel and retention and all that stuff. And if you’re selling a high price product, obviously you need to know sales and have I seen people with almost no product skill, very little engineering skill build successful SaaS companies purely based on their marketing or sales acumen I have Now, is the product usually pretty and quite buggy and they eventually lock up and have a tough time shipping features? Usually in most cases, yes, unless they find an engineering co-founder who really keeps the quality of that code base up. It usually in the long run is a detriment, but can they get to five, 10, 15 million, 20 million a RR mostly bootstrapped just with marketing and sales? Yes, absolutely. I’ve seen it over and over and over. I could give examples. So marketing and sales by far the number one, and look, I was saying this back in 2010 with start small, stay small where I have this line of market comes first, then marketing, then aesthetics, and then functionality. I think I put a distant fourth, which I’m not sure I would actually agree with that. Still things were were a little different back then. Did I put aesthetics forth? I don’t even remember. It doesn’t matter. I put a market first, product class, market first. That was a refrain that I used to have to say a lot when I was speaking at engineering events, trying to educate developers on how to launch products. So marketing and sales, number one, I’m going to be controversial here and I’m not going to put engineering. Number two, I’m going to put product as number two. Product is that sense of what should I build? Not just what market should I enter, what vertical should I attack, but specifically what should we put in this product? How should it look? How should it interact? How should it operate? Because product understanding, much like I talked with Brendan Fortune here, what was it four or five episodes ago? Product understanding is not something everyone has and it’s critical to building something people want and are willing to pay for. And just because you can write code does not mean you know how to build product. This is a big mistake I see non-technical founders make where they say, I need a SaaS product, so I’m going to hire an engineer and they’re going to go build the product. And I’m like, okay, do you know what they should build? And oftentimes it’s like, well, no, but they know how to build it. And I was like, but do you know what they should build? And then the other thing is do you know how they should build it? Meaning do you know what the screens should look like? Do you know what each individual page should do? Do you know where this checkbox should go and what not to build? Do you know what to leave out? There’s so much product thinking that has to go in this early stage that I think as engineers we just think, oh, I’m just going to write code. I’ve been building apps for this credit card company or for this bank or for this municipal government for years, so I know how to build a product and you don’t. You know how to write code and you know how to write software, but that is not a SaaS product. So I put product is number two. Engineering, indeed is number three. And I think you can succeed without engineering skills on your founding team, but in the long run, I do think you need an experienced engineer who’s guarding that code base fiercely. And fourth is hiring and managing people, hiring well and managing well. This is one that’s often overlooked because a lot of us think that we can do it all on our own. I want to be that single founder, solo engineer, and I’m going to build an amazing product and get it to half a million a RR or a million or 5 million, whatever your goals are, and I’m going to do it a loaner. I’m going to do it with a bunch of contractors because the complexity and the expense of hiring team members and managing them, I don’t want to hire or manage, so I’m going to do it on my own. I tried to do that. I thought that that was the way that I was going to be successful, and I kind of did it right. I got to about 150 K in annual revenue with a bunch of small software products, and it was fun. It was really boring. By the time I tried to do ambitious stuff, I needed to hire a team. I needed people to be on board and to be committed. And so one thing that I see folks who have successful SaaS companies where they know how to market, they’re good with product, they found product-market fit, and they’re engineers and they’re shipping and they’re doing all this stuff, but they can’t hire or manage people, is they hit a ceiling quite quickly. And oftentimes they burn out because they’re doing everything themselves. They are on a hiring treadmill where they hire people and they either are mising or they’re not managing them well, and so they constantly are churning through people and they just can’t make headway or make progress. And so could hiring managing actually be maybe number three above engineering feasibly, I could probably steal man an argument that says hiring and managing, if you are really good at it could feasibly Trump engineering. But those are the four skills, and those are the order I have in marketing and sales, then product, then engineering, then hiring and managing. So think about that. If you’re a software engineer, your skillset of course is critical to building the SaaS, but it’s much less critical to the success of the business than you might think. This is why and start small, stay small. 15 years ago, I wrote product last marketing first because nothing happens until you get someone to pay you for your product. And that’s where marketing and sales are number one in my book. My last topic for today is it’s a story. It’s a story from 2015, boy, it might’ve been January of 2016, and it is the one time in the history as Derek and I were building Drip that we committed to a deadline for a feature that we publicly committed. And it was that one time that we forgot a big development task or a big product task. The moment it was like it was absolutely Murphy’s Law that the moment we announced it, we realized, oh, we shouldn’t have done that. So we took the tact as we were building Drip that we obviously wanted high feature velocity. We wanted to ship as fast as possible, but code quality was always extremely important and we didn’t see the need to generate external pressure, meaning go on social media or email the whole list and say, Hey, next month on March 21st, we are going to be launching this huge feature. Because we were intrinsically motivated. We were two founders of this company and we were a small enough team that the DNA was to just get stuff done fast, but at high quality. So what I’m saying here probably doesn’t apply if you have a 50 person engineering team. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. I don’t know if I could scale this to an org that big, but we really were a high performing, high functioning team, and we all moved to ship quickly. And so putting deadlines, especially public now, we could put some internal deadlines where I’d say, Hey, do we think we can get this done by next Wednesday? Do we think we can get this done in three weeks? Realizing that the further out you think about the cone of uncertainty gets more and more uncertain, right? It’s like if I say three weeks, do I really mean three to four? Probably two to four. But if I say, can we get this done by tomorrow? It’s probably tomorrow, right? I’m more certain about deadlines that are closer to me. So we would talk internally about when we thought we could ship it, but we never went public with those deadlines. And then in mid 2015, we embarked on the biggest and frankly the longest duration wise feature that we ever built with Drip, at least pre-acquisition, and it was to build visual workflows. So we had all these automations, but it was, if you think about Zapier, where there’s a dropdown list that says, Hey, this is the trigger and then this is what it does. And we had automations in there and they were doing great, and we were growing. We had product-market fit. It was great, but the hardest part is you just had all these automations doing things independently instead of them being linked in a visual chain. If you go to HubSpot or I’m trying to think of who else has this now, but back then, of course it was Infusionsoft. Oh, it was active campaign. They had actually a really nice visual builder interface. So we set towards doing that, and I remember Derek and I talking about, I think it’s two to three months and it took five months, and there were reasons. It was a complex task. We wanted to do it really, really well, and we wanted it to ship at the level of our taste of our product taste. And so we got to the point where it was about two weeks prior to launching, and we knew it was two weeks prior to launching because the code was checked in and we were testing and it was some final things we were implementing. And so I went on Twitter, did a blog post, emailed everybody, and I put this blurry, we blurred part of the visual builder and said, something incredible is coming on this date two weeks out. And we were like, this is so cool. We get to, people were conjecturing and wondering, and the internet was a buzz and we were so excited about it. And I’m pretty sure I did that in the morning. And by the afternoon, one of us realized this changes our entire onboarding flow. Onboarding took weeks to build our onboarding. And Drip was really extensive and it worked really well and we had never revamped it. And we knew that once we had workflows, visual workflows in there, the onboarding didn’t make sense anymore. So suddenly we were like, we don’t really have time to redo this. So we jumped into a conference room and it was just like panic DEFCON five type thing. And it was Derek, myself, and I believe it was Anna who was our customer success person. And we said, what do we need to change? And we spent an hour just hashing out what can we do to make this work? And then we pulled in a different engineer, Ian off of the tasks he was working on and Derek set to get in designing, and we were like, we really want to hit this deadline. We could push the deadline out. Obviously, I don’t actually know how many people would notice. There’s always that thing of you’re paying more attention to your deadlines than other people are, but it was stressful and I remember thinking, I’m never doing this again. In the end, we made it, we got onboarding redone and everything was fine. It was a stressful couple of weeks. So the lesson is not, I’ll never do that again, but I think the level of rigor that I had at the time about dotting on the I’S and crossing all the T’s was not enough that I could call my shot like this, because if you’re going to do this, you need, I think to have checklists and sanity checks and double checks and probably a few brainstorming conversation, just thinking through, if I’m going to commit to this, have I thought of everything? Because really we hadn’t, we’d forgotten this thing and it was the one time that we really committed to something. So I think there are a couple takeaways here. Number one, public deadlines can be helpful, but I think if you’re going to commit to one that you need to be pretty damn sure that you have thought of everything. And so the big mistake I think we made was not committing to the public deadline, but I think it was not being rigorous enough with thinking through everything that needed to happen there. But the other thing that I would say is I don’t know that public deadlines are that necessary in most cases. I think internal deadlines could definitely be helpful for everyone working towards a thing, especially if you have multiple teams. You have sales and customer success and support who all need to be on board and trained up on a feature. Of course, at that point, you got to have some type of concrete deadline. But I think people also overindex on specifically public deadlines and perhaps overuse them because we certainly function quite well without them for a long time. So that wraps up this episode of Startups For the Rest Of Us. Hope you enjoyed a little walk down memory lane as well as some thoughts on Paul Graham essays and Twitter X conversations.

Before we get into the episode, if you are a SaaS founder, doing at least 1 million in a RR are going to be there soon. You should check out SaaS institute.com. That’s our premium coaching program for founders doing seven and eight figures. We have our first two coaches in place, Jordan Gaul, who many of you know from bootstrapped web, founder of Cart Hook, founder of Rosie, as well as Mark Thomas, who runs growth at Podia and formally worked at Powered by Search. Both have been TinySeed mentors for many years, and both are exceptional at helping SaaS founders figure out their roadblocks, figure out those bottlenecks and get things going. So SaaS institute.com, if you are looking to be in a mastermind group with four other ambitious seven and eight figure founders, if you’re looking for amazing one-on-one coaching community, a couple in-person events per year, there’s a lot going on and we’re putting together an incredible group of folks. And with that, let’s dive into the episode.  Colleen Schnettler:There were like hundreds of competitors and I was like, who are these people? And so it’s a little bit of a rant and it’s good for capitalism, but it’s bad for me in that these products are really good. And no matter what you think is unique, it’s probably not. Someone’s probably doing it with more money and better ui. So you really just have to put the work in to make the product better. The product development has to be a continuous cycle.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today in episode seven, we’re back with Colleen after almost four months since our last conversation in the world of startups, four months can feel like an eternity. I was eager to hear how things are going. So Colleen, when we last left your story, you were building a tool aimed at directors of engineering. How did all that play out? Where do you stand today?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, yes, it’s been a few months and it has been quite a wild ride. I’m going to be honest. So my first vision last time we talked was going to be this product, and I was targeting engineering managers in the hopes that it would help their developers save time by allowing other teammates, like non-technical teammates to build their own reports. And so the first I got some kind of initial, which when you’re trying to go zero one is really fun, and it kind of felt like there was a lot of energy and momentum around the initial product, but truthfully, that fizzled out pretty quickly. So at that time, it kind of felt like I had more of a, oh gee whiz, this is cool and not a wow, this is actually a useful product. I’m going to integrate into my workflow. So at the time, there were maybe three or four people who were actually interested in using the product to build reports. So I worked really closely with them to say, how do we decrease the kind of cognitive overload for the person using the product? So you’d come into the product and it’s AI on top of your database to build reports, and you say, but what do I want to know from my database? I don’t even know what I can ask. So I built in suggested questions based on your schema, and then I shortened the time from, someone has this book, I forget her name, but it’s called First Time to Wow. And it’s this idea of you get something in front of your customers, how do you wow them quickly? So now I have it set up in a way where you come in, it shows you a sample question customized to your database, you click it and you immediately get a chart so you can immediately see a visual that represents the data, you can add it to dashboards, all of that to say there was a lot of early development working tightly with potential customers. But as I continued to go down that path, I just wasn’t getting the engagement I thought I would get from developers and engineering managers. When push came to shove, it just felt like they were casually interested, but this product was not really solving a pain point. And I think part of that was because you can’t put it in front of completely non-technical people yet the AI is just not good enough. So a lot of development work, talking to a lot of developers, talking to a lot of engineering managers, but ultimately I don’t think they’re my target market.  Rob Walling:Early stage founders are often faced with this dilemma. When is the right time to move on from an idea and how do you know when that’s the right direction?  Colleen Schnettler:That is such a hard question because I feel like for every successful bootstrap business out there, you’ll hear both sides of the story. You’ll be like, this person was successful. They pivoted so quickly, this person was successful, they stuck with it for three years. So I was really just going on what I felt was the right decision. And for me, the reporting that I was looking at targeting engineering managers and developers that was going towards embedding reporting for customers and looking deeply at that space, I just didn’t think I had any unique angle. I mean, there’s a lot of products out there that’s embedded reporting for customers, and they’re really pretty good. And I didn’t have any kind of unique takes. So at one point I even almost took a consulting job building embedded reports for a potential customer in order to learn more about that space and the limitation of that space. But I decided not to do that because talking to a couple different people, it seemed like the requirements were so disparate. And I didn’t want to get myself back in that situation where I was a consultant who thought I was building a product, but I was really just consulting.  Rob Walling:And so you find yourself at a decision point. You decide, well, this isn’t the right idea for me, or this is not how I’m going to proceed. What next? Are there fallback ideas that you’ve fall back to or is it searching for the next thing?  Colleen Schnettler:So actually, to be completely honest, I went and spent a week in the woods, and that gave me some time to really think about, do I want to pursue this embedded reporting idea? Do I want to stick with this idea and try another take on it? Do I want to shut the business down? Obviously a huge opportunity cost to continue to pursue this idea. And what I landed on is I’m not done with this idea yet. I want to take another swing at it, come approach it from a different direction.  Rob Walling:I’ve talked for years about the value of founder retreats, taking a break and spending some time away from the computer can give you the space to find some clarity. Colleen’s time in the woods seemed to reinvigorate her interest in a previous idea, a report builder for marketers. So I was wondering what led her back to this idea.  Colleen Schnettler:I actually hired a marketing coach to help me figure out an ICP, and I sat down with him and there was this immediate thing that happened where before he was a marketing coach. He was a marketing analyst, and he was like, oh, I literally would’ve bought this tool. This was a problem I ran into all the time where I needed data from my database. I think you can really reach these people by teaching marketers sql. So teach marketer sequel and see if it resonates. And so I said, all right, let’s try it. And marketing I think is really good for me because I’m a developer and I’m really, really interested in the marketing space. It’s something I really want to learn. And one of the things I do well is kind of learn in public. And so learning about the space and talking about the space is something that comes very naturally to me. And like I said, it’s something I’ve wanted to do anyway. It felt like a good alignment of things I wanted to do and potential customers.  Rob Walling:And so where do you stand today? Do we have a product in the market? Do we have folks using it?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, so I am all in on this new idea. And the new idea is I help marketers build better reports. I’m targeting marketing data analysts, people who are marketers. So there’s actually, I’ve been in this space for a while now. There’s a big difference between data analysts who are pure data people. They’re with Python and R and whatever. And then the marketing data analysts and marketing, those people are marketing first. So they’re trying to take their existing data and figure out how to use that data to do better marketing, to sell more product. And so I’m all in on those people. I started a newsletter. I am on LinkedIn. I’m sending thousands of cold dms on LinkedIn. I have a whole strategy behind helping them get data out of their database using sql. So that’s kind of what my newsletter’s about. I have a couple users and I have my first paying customer, which is pretty exciting.  Rob Walling:Wow, that’s amazing. How long ago did that happen?  Colleen Schnettler:Two weeks.  Rob Walling:Okay.  Colleen Schnettler:Just happened.  Rob Walling:So they’re paying, are they using it as well?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah. What’s interesting about this person is I got on a call with them and they hate my ui. I don’t know how else to say it, but they’re like, this product isn’t even very good. And I was like, oh, okay. But I do think it’s interesting that this person was like, this product isn’t very good. So I didn’t think they were going to convert. And then it was kind of fun. I was in the woods having my soul searching, and I didn’t have Stripe notifications set up. So it was two days later I realized they had converted and I sent them a message and they were like, yeah, well, I needed to run more queries. I was like, awesome. But I mean, this is still the wild west. This is still my plan is focus in on these marketing data analyst people with everything I have. I think what I’m going to find is their data is in many different data sources, but try to find, I’m just really, really trying to find that one pain point, one little niche where I can just grab a foothold while simultaneously, I’m a one woman shop now because budget is tight. So simultaneously making the product something that these people want to use. And so it’s crazy.  Rob Walling:This is early stage where everything’s cloudy and you wish you had 10 times more hours to get there faster. Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So what is the product today? Is it I can type out an English sentence and AI turns that into a SQL query and then pulls data out? Or is there more than that?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, so the product today is, it’s a chat with your database, but you ask, it’s fine tuned to you ask a question, it returns to SQL Query. You can edit the sql, which was funny, that was a heavily feature, but no one actually does it. It’s like people just want to know that they can, they want to see it. They want to see it. You can edit the sequel, you run the sequel. It gives you charts. It gives you tables that you can export or add to a dashboard. So the dashboard seems to be kind of an interesting thing. Right now, the marketers so far, and again, it’s a very small sample size I’m working with right now, they seem to really be leaning into what can I do? What reports can I build with this? And you also have a live shareable link. And so one of the things I’ve thought about is you can do triggers, you could do triggers off your database, which is actually something I’m really excited about. My one paying customer really wants me to do that and I need to talk to more people. But I don’t know, I think there’s something there. I think there’s possibility there. The goal is to have something, they come in, they set up, and they don’t have to log into Hello Query. So if you look at product analytics tools or some other tools, even like a Google, they send you emails once a week, here’s what you need to know. And you’re like, sweet, I’m happy with that. So that’s kind of where I want to go with this.  Rob Walling:I’m just curious how much your first customer is paying you.  Colleen Schnettler:$59 a month,  Rob Walling:You decide on that amount.  Colleen Schnettler:I literally made it up.  Rob Walling:Usually how it goes. Yeah, we have TinySeed companies come in and they’ll be like, our pricing is 499 and 1,002 thousand or whatever, high end tools. And we will look at their data and I’ll say, why are these people paying you $29? And they’re like, well, so when we launched, we launched at 20. You know what I mean? And it’s like it just shows you that’s what happens. 59 will become 99, we’ll become, when you build something people really, really want, that number goes up fast. There’s one interesting comment you made to me via email. I want to surface because so many people listening to this episode will have felt this or might be feeling this now, but to quote you said, the bar for product is so high in today’s market, or at least my solution is not compelling enough to have a low bar. There’s this prevailing wisdom that if someone wants something bad enough, they’ll put up with a mediocre ui. But it seems every category is crowded. And I hear this, I hear this from folks getting started of the days of a crappy MVP may be gone, and I can either confirm nor deny because I do know that there are some folks, there are some areas where you can still build crappy MVPs and they work, but there are also places where it’s not. And the more technical your audience, the more design focused, whatever, they pick up on products that are really and not poorly built, but that don’t look amazing, don’t have amazing UX and don’t feel finished. We can tell you and I can tell as builders when a product is finished. So what does that mean for you then as someone who is building a product and has what we might call an MVP now with one customer? What is that sentiment that you sent me imply for your journey?  Colleen Schnettler:Honestly, I think it just seems that the products are so good and it seems like every niche that you can think of, that’s what it feels like to me has five or six products. There’s no world of like, oh, there’s one competitor and they have a crappy product. People are just building better stuff than they were 10 years ago, right? 10 years ago. You’re like, oh, this thing, it looks crappy, but it does exactly what I say it’s going to do. And that kind of worked for some people, but I just feel like the level of polish you need in a product is so much higher now. And it’s funny because I think of it because the very first version of my product, I thought it looked pretty good, and then I put it in front of people, like five people, and I was like, oh. And they were like, Ooh, where do I change the name? And I expect to be able to do that in line, and this font looks weird and it’s too big. And I was like, but it does what I said it was going to do. Okay.  Rob Walling:Yeah. When you’re talking to engineering managers or even marketers who have this high bar for the tools they use now, right? Because things are polished. Makes  Colleen Schnettler:Sense. Yeah, things are polished and I don’t know, it feels like this whole revolution of everyone, shipping product is great, but everyone is shipping a product. So there is a ton of competition even in, so when I was thinking if I wanted to do other ideas, I was talking to friends that work in other industries. I talk to someone in insurance. I talked to someone who’s in this really niche, really niche industry you’ve probably never heard of. And I was like, definitely they don’t have tools because no one even knows what they do, but they do. She was like, yeah, we have five competitors. I looked at the schools I looked at, I was looked across anything where I knew someone, environmental survey companies. I was like, all of these sectors have products. I think I even told you I filled out, they call ’em request for proposal for this really niche thing. I was like, no one’s going to apply for this or submit a proposal to this because no one has ever heard of this. I didn’t get it. But that was another example of there were hundreds of competitors and I was like, who are these people? And so it’s a little bit of a rant and it’s good for capitalism, but it’s bad for me in that these products are really good. And no matter what you think is unique, it’s probably not. Someone’s probably doing it with more money and better ui. So you really just have to put the work in to make the product better. The product development has to be a continuous cycle. If  Rob Walling:I ever prediction for where you’re headed, and this is just none of us can predict where you’re headed with the product, but I feel like it won’t be inventing a new category or it won’t be building something that has no competition. It will be figuring out, as you get into this, now you have your ICP. What tools do they use today that they’re already paying for that are not good, that are either way overpriced? And I don’t mean 20% overpriced. I mean five x what you could charge half or a quarter and still mint money or that are really, they’re polished and you can do a lot of things, but they still don’t work. And there’s either a major deficit in a big competitor or there’s a corner of the market that isn’t being handled. And I think it’s kind of being in the game, increasing your luck surface area by just being there, having the conversations, building something. And I think the difference between success or failure will be if you can find that spot where you fit in the market.  Colleen Schnettler:I agree. I think one of the things with what I have now, if you look at it as chat with your database, build reports, that’s not really solving a problem. What is that? That’s cool, but what is it? What is the problem you are solving? What can you do with that? I think general, some people, so chat with your database is not and any way unique. Everyone’s doing that and a lot of the companies doing it are trying to position it as the data analyst for your company. I don’t think that’s right. I think that is still too vague. People are still, the whole point of hiring a real data analyst is they tell you what you don’t know that you don’t know. So I think you’re right. I think this is all about exploration. This is about finding out what tools they’re using that maybe aren’t good enough. It might be an aggregation of tools. I can see a world where it’s dump everything in Big query. I do it for you, dump everything in Big Query. And I sit on top of Big Query because Looker gets really expensive really quickly. Yeah. But again, this is the beginning still. I’m still in the beginning.  Rob Walling:In the last episode, Colleen was frustrated at her lack of progress. And now that she’s 22 months in, it feels like she’s just getting started again. And you know what? Sometimes that’s just how it goes. Sometimes you have to pivot your idea. Sometimes you lose a co-founder. Sometimes it takes a while to find a problem worth solving. That’s being a founder. In talking with Colleen after this interview, she has about six months of runway to find some traction. Six months to find a signal in all the noise that indicates she’s working in the right direction.

It’s common, and it’s unfortunate that so many people kind of fall into that trap as well as the build it and they will come thing or just the, okay, so I built this product, now how do I market it? I see this question on Reddit and it’s like, geez, dude, are you kidding me? It is startups For the Rest Of Us. I’m your host, Rob Wallen. Each week on this show, I cover topics related to building ambitious, yet sustainable B2B SaaS companies. So you could be bootstrapped, mostly bootstrapped, maybe you’ve raised buckets of funding as some of the listeners do. Historically, the show has focused on bootstrapping, but really it’s about building independent, self-sustaining startups that aren’t tied to this need for fast, fast, fast growth, billion dollar outcomes, and the constant influx of additional capital. In today’s episode, I answer listener questions. It’s a good mix of some voice questions, some intermediate questions, and I think I even have an earlier stage question to answer as well before I dive in to the questions. If you have not checked out SaaS launchpad, that is the best course that I know for early, early stage SaaS founders. So it’s all about finding ideas, vetting ideas, trying to do some validation, building your product, getting to launch, doing marketing before you start coding, doing marketing before you launch the product, and finding those early adopters and early users. That’s at SaaS launchpad.co if you want to check it out, is by far the best course I have ever built has almost 10 hours of in-depth video content that is just packed with tactics and strategies and all the stuff that I espouse. This is stuff that I don’t have in any other books. It’s things that I touch on here and there on the podcast, but have definitely not gone into this depth ever in anything that I’ve released. So SaaS launchpad.co if you’re just getting started. And with that, let’s dive in to our first listener question.  Craig:Hey Rob, a longtime listener, first time caller. Thanks so much for the podcast and for the SaaS playbook. I listen to the podcast every week and I’ve read the SaaS playbook five or six different times, and each time I extract new information and insight from it, it’s just such an incredible resource for bootstrap founders. So first of all, thanks so much for all you do. A little context, I’ve built a B2B SaaS company, which provides an analytics platform to HR teams to help them make data informed decisions about their talent. So think about things like collaboration, insights, employee engagement, drivers, predictive attrition. And for this we use a variety of different data sources such as HR systems, business systems, and employee surveys. For MVP, we built many components such as our data Mars and pipelines, but for others, we decided to white label other SaaS solutions. For example, for the surveys, there’s so many great survey platforms out there, we just couldn’t justify custom building something given the relatively low expense we would incur by white labeling an existing solution. Ideally though, we would prefer not to have these dependencies on other SaaS companies because we would like to flexibility and control over the cost and features within our platform. Since we are a bootstrap startup, however, we found white label components to be a quick and low cost method of achieving product-market fit and launching our MVP. So I’ve got a few questions around this. Number one, how would you advise thinking about the mix of custom-built versus white label components, does the optimal mix vary based on growth stage? And number two, is there an inflection point at which we should consider prioritizing a migration away from these white label components? And then lastly, if we were to sell the company one day, does the reliance on other SaaS for specific capabilities impact our valuation versus a fully custom solution? Thanks for your time,  Rob Walling:Greg. Thanks for calling in and for the kind words at the top of your voicemail, if you’ve read the SaaS playbook five or six times, I take that as a real compliment and I take it as a sign that it’s probably providing some value to you. So thank you for that. I really do like this question because it’s not super common that people will completely white label big areas of their app. I guess I’ve seen folks like they’ll do an integration with an electronic signature app if they don’t want to build that functionality. So I’ve seen it done here and there, but it sounds like you’ve done this with multiple white labeled vendors, which is obviously a good way to, as you said, get to market faster, not to have to build all this functionality. I will admit I do see white labeled integrations like this as a form of technical debt, and it’s one of those that it may never come back to bite you, and that’s great, and I think that’d be a big part of my thought process here is if it’s not broken, I would probably not prioritize fixing it very highly unless I felt like the white label vendor or that part of the app was existential to my existence as a company. And so if I was doing half a million dollars a year, unless one of the vendors is jacking up their prices or they’re not reliable or there are bugs or there’s downtime, obviously then it’s broken and I would consider prioritizing fixing it. But with none of those things in place, if there’s not anything going wrong with any of them, I could see getting to a million a RR before really considering swapping them out. And the way I would think about it is which of these is the biggest platform risk? Really what this is, it’s a form of platform risk. Now it’s lower risk than something like building on X Twitter or making a Facebook app or making a Shopify app. Certainly lower risk. And if you go back to the episode where I talked about platform risk, I talked about how there were eight levels and three different factors that contribute to those. And I believe what you have only has one of the factors, which is a technical reliance on a third party, you are relying on their white labeled solution and the API for your product to properly function. So one of Craig’s questions is how would you advise thinking about the mix of custom built versus white label components? And for me, white label is a risk. There’s platform risk and it’s a form of I guess technical debt, something that long-term. I mean, if I’m going to become a 10 million a RRR 20 million a RR SaaS company, I have to undo this at some point. Much like if I’m going to become a 10 or 20 million a RR SaaS company, at a certain point I have to go back and fix some of the crappy code that I wrote in the early days when I was trying to get to an MVP. These are different, but they’re similarities. And so the mix and the way I would think about it is I want as much of my custom code that I own, that is my custom IP as possible as makes sense. But of course there’s a balance here. If I can get to 250,000 or 500,000 annual recurring revenue much faster by using white label, I want to probably consider that. Then Craig asks, does the optimal mix vary based on growth stage? And I think it does. I mean, there are people that are building a hundred percent in no code trying to get to 10 KA month so they can quit the day job so they can then rebuild it with code. And I would never want to be running a million dollar SaaS company that was in no code personally, I’d be so worried about the brittleness and the scalability and platform risk and just all those things. So it really does to me, depend on the growth stage. One of the reasons is the further along you get, the more valuable it is. And if I have an asset, let’s just say you’re at a million or 2 million a RR and throw out a five XARR, multiple growing fast, checking five to 10 million business, that’s when I mean stuff’s real at that point. So that’s when I start getting nervous around these kinds of dependencies. The technical debt, the platform risk that I’m talking about when I’m supporting myself and team members, I’m paying people’s mortgages. I have something worth millions of dollars, makes me more and more nervous. Then Craig asks, is there an inflection point at which we should consider prioritizing migration away from these white label components? I mean, I would do it one at a time over time, and maybe you never replace all of them. You go with the least risky one last and the one that is performing really well for you and it’s inexpensive and it’s easy street, what are the factors there? Jacking the price up, there’s bugs, there’s reliability issues. These are all the things that can contribute to that. And so I would probably start thinking about it around a half a million a RR, maybe a million, and I would have a list probably in priority order of what I thought we should do. And then you put that into your roadmap at a certain point. Do you do one every quarter or one every six months? Depends on what else you’re trying to ship. And then lastly, Craig’s question is, if we were to sell the company one day, does a reliance on other SaaS for specific capabilities impact our valuation versus a fully custom solution? It depends. It depends on is it 10% of your functionality? Is it 80% of your functionality? There’s a big difference, and are they causing you any problems? Right? That platform risk will probably be factored in, but only if it is, again, more than just a small bit of your functionality. And if you have 10 modules in your web app and one or two of them are white labeled, I could see someone probably saying, well, I’m going to buy it and rewrite those custom, right? But if five of your 10 are white labeled and it’s some pretty complicated piece of functionality, then someone thinks, well, I want to want to buy it and rewrite those, but that’s a ton of work. So they would probably factor that in. So the answer there is kind of maybe it really depends on the extent of it, how hard it would be to recreate that functionality and whether there have been any issues at all with the white labeled components to date. So thanks for that question, Craig. I really do appreciate you writing in with it because one that we haven’t heard on the show before. My next question is from Ian, and Ian was kind enough to send in a question and then they kind of answered their own question a couple of weeks later. So let’s listen to his first voicemail, which was a question about a VoIP system as well as a way to get to his SaaS metrics.  Ian:Hi, Rob, longtime listener, first time caller. First off, I wanted to thank you for all the great work you’ve done to help bootstrapped founders and co-founders like myself. Startups For the Rest Of Us has been helping us and encouraging us since we started our business back in 2016. My name is Y Han and I’m the co-founder of Wash Dry Fold, POS. We’re a bootstrapped B2B SaaS company that offers point of sale and management software exclusively to laundromats that offer wash dry fold. We built this very niche software because we needed it in our own laundromats located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We’ve recently sold our thousandth point of sale system and hit the 1 million a RR milestone. We just hired a full-time employee and I need help finding the right tools to help us scale. For several years now, I’ve been searching for a software that would centralize virtual phone lines for all employees while also providing a way to centralize our inbox for tech support, customer service sales, et cetera. Beyond this kind of VoIP slash CRM functionality, I also really need in-depth SaaS metrics like LTV based on custom cohorts. We already use ActiveCampaign, slack, Calendly, WooCommerce, and all the Google tools, but I’m really struggling to find a solution that pulls everything together and adds all the functionality without adding multiple new subscriptions that then everyone on the team has to learn. It’s something I’ve researched, but I’d love to hear from a B2B SaaS veteran or from somebody who has deep experience in the space. Thanks so much again for all you do.  Rob Walling:So when I heard this question, I thought to myself, Hey, that’s a pretty cool niche and congrats on getting to a million ARR in such a small, what I would consider a small market. It’s not huge, but that’s great. The things that came to mind when Ian asked this question, and then I’ll let Ian answer his own question with the solutions he went with. When I think of a VoIP solution to centralize all the phone numbers, I think of open phone or Grasshopper and Grasshopper’s older school, it’s been around for what, 10, 15 years, but open phone. I know a lot of startups that use it. And then for in-depth SaaS metrics, if you’re using Stripe, I would be using one of three ProfitWell chart Mogul or Bare Metrics. Those are the most popular. We see it across TinySeed and MicroConf companies, but those were the things that came to mind. And then for crm, I don’t know, I think of close.com that integrates outbound VoIP with CRM functionality, but I don’t know. I don’t know if they do inbound. I would guess not. And so I was thinking that these are three different tools. These are not, there’s no one tool that does all of what Ian has asked for, but to have Inbound VoIP to have CRM separately, well, I’m like, okay, well pipe drive and close and active campaign. Since you’re already using Active Campaign, I’ve heard their CRM functionality is not the worst. And so maybe that’s a piece I would use. And then of course, SaaS metrics already weighed in on. So with that, let’s cut to the chase and hear what Ian decided to go with.  Ian:Hey Rob, it’s Ian. I sent in a question a few weeks ago and I just wanted to give you an update because I think I have a few answers for one for VoIP. I ended up going with Zoom, and it turns out you can bundle a lot of their stuff to get really good values, and they’re still, even with a Zoom Pro license, it was still half the cost of RingCentral and some of the other more VoIP central services. So I think that’s a really nice resource for someone looking for something similar. For the CRM piece of it, I think we’re just going to go with active campaign CRM functionality because it’s got the basic stuff that we need. And then the third thing I was really looking for was SaaS metrics, and I’ve kind of dove in deeper on that. And there’s certain things like net revenue retention where I haven’t really been tracking all the metrics that I should have been tracking or the way that I should have been tracking them specifically because with certain customers, I guess if they add a seat, which for us would be adding a store, that’s an increase in that customer’s spend, but we just track it by store and not by actual customer. And so there’s a lot of kind of funny things that I probably need to go back and recategorize go find when they first started with us and calculate their LTV and all that kind of stuff. And so it would be nice to still know a really good SaaS metrics software that somebody’s used and liked, but at the same time, I’m realizing that I don’t really even have all the right data to get the right metrics out of the SaaS software, at least in the past. So anyway, just wanted to give you an update on everything. Appreciate what you’re doing, always listen to new episodes, so keep doing what you’re doing and thanks. Bye.  Rob Walling:So obviously, thanks for weighing in on that, Ian. I didn’t know that Zoom had any type of VoIP functionality, so that’s really interesting. And it’s less than RingCentral, which is yet another one of these phone centralization platforms. And then Ian did wind up going with ActiveCampaign, which is cool, and I’m not sure if they’re using Stripe. And so the solutions that I suggested may be a little trickier to get to. But with that, you’ve heard both my and Ian’s take on this question. So thanks for writing in Ian. If you want to invest in founders, you can do so through my world-class accelerator and Venture fund TinySeed. We are currently raising our third fund after having raised and mostly deployed almost $42 million across our prior funds. If you’re an accredited investor or the equivalent in your country and you are interested in indexing across dozens, if not hundreds of B2B SaaS companies that are hand picked by myself, a r, and our team at TinySeed to be the companies that we believe will succeed, you can head to TinySeed dot com slash invest. If you enter your info there, it goes straight to a R. You’ve heard him on startups For the Rest Of Us, and you can have a conversation with him if you have any questions or you can receive our deck and our memo and just the thesis of what we’re investing under because we are a unique venture fund and SaaS accelerator. So if you think you might be interested in putting some capital to work in ambitious, mostly bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders, head to TinySeed dot com slash and invest. My next question comes from X Twitter where a listener named or Lee, he’s at sunglasses face on X Twitter, and he asks, what change in mindset do you notice between founders doing $100 MRRA thousand dollars, 10,000 MRR and a hundred thousand MRR? It’s an interesting question. It’s worded in a way where I’m not sure I accept the premise of it. It implies that if you’re doing a hundred or a thousand dollars a month, that you have a different mindset than someone doing 10,000 or a hundred thousand. And if you think about it, the founder doing a hundred thousand MRR was probably at 10,000 a year or two ago and a thousand a few months before that and a hundred a few months before that. And so it’s the same founder, and I just don’t know that your mindset shifts that much, but I kind of want to answer a related but a different question or just reshape the question. I feel like orally might be asking, what mindset do you need to be successful? What mindset shifts do you need to have internally to get to a hundred thousand MRR? And the interesting thing is I think there are three components to success, hard work, luck and skill. So if you have a lot of luck, I actually don’t know that you need any mindset shifts. You just get lucky and that happens. But that is by far that the minority of founders that I see being successful. So let’s take a look at hard work and skill. I think the mindset of those two things is you put it in the hard work and you do the grind, and you do the things that sometimes you don’t want to do, and you build your own skills and you don’t shy away from saying, well, that sounds hard, that sounds uncomfortable. I don’t think I want to go do SEO or figure out how to do pay-per-click ads. I just want to go eat ice cream instead of eating spinach and working out, and yet I want to lose weight. So that to me is just a big mindset for success, is someone who is willing for a time to grind, to put in the time and to do the things it takes to grow the company rather than the things that they want to do. Your desire of what you want to do to grow a company has very little with the optimal approach to growing that company. Another thing that Einar and I talk a lot about is that the successful founders that we see within TinySeed, and the number is right around 15% of companies that we have backed are above a million a RR. They’re seven or eight figure annual recurring revenue SaaS companies. So I mean, it’s a big chunk. The industry average, and I don’t actually know where a R got this number, but the industry average is 4%. And so we obviously have picked some good companies and hopefully have also helped them with the mentorship in the community and the advice and the money help them accelerate. But something we see with our TinySeed founders is the ones who succeed, they get a lot of stuff done quickly, they ship a lot of things, and they’re right enough of the time, and they’re not always right the first time, but if they take a marketing approach and they roll it out, or if they build a set of features or whatever it is they’re trying, they just figure out how to make it work 55 60, 65, 70% of the time, there’s some percentage that’s above 50 that they’re generally right and their gut is pretty good. So the mindset of shipping quickly and not being in analysis paralysis is important, but also the mindset of generally weighing options and picking the most likely to succeed and having a pretty good founder gut, but also just a good rubric in their head of what’s the next thing that is going to move the needle? What’s the biggest bottleneck in my business? And how can I relieve that? How can I eliminate that bottleneck such that I then discovered the next and the next one? And to me, growing a company is almost entirely about identifying the next bottleneck and eliminating it and then discovering the next one. It’s this never ending. Yeah, it is a never ending hamster wheel. Now that I think about how depressing and this week on depressing startup stories For the Rest Of Us, let’s talk about the never ending hamster wheel that you’re on as a SaaS founder. It is, and that’s why the payoff in the end of being able to sell it for millions of dollars makes it worth it, in my opinion. But it is sometimes, I don’t want to say sad truth, just the uncomfortable truth I guess of this is going to be hard. I don’t see many people building SaaS companies who are like, this is so much fun, this is great. It’s like once you get in it, you’re like, woo, this is hard. But it’s worth it because either it becomes extremely profitable or you can’t exit for that, that never have to work again, money. I’ll even take or Lee’s question in a different way. What do I see in founders? What mindset do I see in founders who get stuck at a hundred or a thousand or 10 KMRR and never make it past it? They make the same mistakes over and over. They don’t get out of their own way. They move slowly. They only do things they want to do. They launch multiple products at once because they can’t just focus on something and grind. They think they want to build a media company or an audience and then try to sell it to them. Don’t do that. If you’re building SaaS, build your network, not your audience. It really is. It goes back to the don’ts. What was it? A year ago, 18 months ago, I had an episode of Seven Things You Should Never Do As a SaaS Founder. Go listen to that episode. And then I added an eighth a couple episodes later, but it was just that long list of the same mistakes that I see founders and aspiring founders making thinking they can sell everything on Twitter and they don’t have to do any hard work. It’s common, and it’s unfortunate that so many people kind of fall into that trap as well as the build it, and they will come thing or just say, okay, so I built this product. Now how do I market it? I see this question on Reddit. I built it. Now how do I market it? The reason I come across it is then someone will mention me my name or SaaS Playbook or TinySeed MicroConf. So then I get an alert and I go out and check it out and it’s like, geez, dude, are you kidding me? All this information that’s out there. I mean, I guess that’s the mindset is the mindset is you should have sought out someone who’s done this before and who is trying to give advice. Hell, I give 30 minutes of free advice on this podcast every week and every other week, 15 minutes of free advice on YouTube. Or you can spend $10 and buy one of my books. Or you can spend $500 and buy the SaaS launchpad course. So you can go from free all the way up, but realize I’m saying the things that can help you not make those mistakes. And of course, if you’re listening to this, you already know that, but the mindset of there’s no one else out there who has done it before me, or I’m not going to spend the time to go seek out advice and learn about this stuff. I’m just going to go build something that’s a dangerous mindset. I left that mindset long ago. I did used to have the mindset of, well, I need to figure all this out. I’m going to figure out a new path. No one else is doing the path that I want to do, which of course was bootstrapping. And really there it was almost no one else doing it, and it was like base camp and Joel Poll skate at the time when oh five when I was blogging about this. But I’ve let that go. And now when I go to do anything, when we launched on YouTube, we hired a consultant and a content producer. When we launched on LinkedIn, we hired a consultant. Someone knows this better than I do, and they’re ahead of me, and I’m willing to pay both in time and in money to learn that very quickly. Now, if I didn’t have as much budget as I do these days, running a tiny seat of MicroConf, in the old days, I would have educated myself. I would’ve gone to the subreddits, to YouTube, to audio books, to podcasts to try to figure out what do other people know about this topic that I don’t? And that mindset of learning from others and taking advice and not just listening and being like, eh, that doesn’t fit with how I want to grow a business. And so I’m going to say in my head that it just doesn’t work, or I’m going to do this other thing anyways, even though people are saying, don’t go B2C and build a two-sided marketplace and don’t build a media company and don’t price your product at 10 or $20 a month and don’t try to go with one time sales or whatever the advice is, but that doesn’t work anymore or that makes me uncomfortable, or it makes me think I’m going to have to do stuff that I don’t want to do, like market and talk to customers and actually do sales calls. Whatever it is, it’s that mindset of I am going to actually learn from others and I don’t have to do exactly what someone else prescribes, but I’m at least going to factor that in when I ask for other opinions and when I go out and read a book or listen to someone talk about this on a podcast, that I’m going to not dismiss them and I’m going to be open to learning. I think that that desire to learn and the openness to learning from the right people, I think is a mindset for founder success. So thanks for that question orally. I hope it was helpful. My next question is from Timo from Germany. Timo writes, I run a two-sided marketplace for German speaking talent living overseas. We monetize by offering a paid subscription to employers. I’ve hired a salesperson to call free signups to sell them to the paid plan, which has positively impacted our free to paid conversion. However, we don’t reach everyone and some people simply don’t want to take the call. When we offer people the chance to voluntarily book a call by email, we get very few bookings. But since I know the calls work, I’ve considered making them mandatory to unlock certain features. I’ve never seen anyone do this after signup, which makes me wonder if it’s a bad idea. What are your thoughts on making calls mandatory? We are B2B only, and the subscription costs 90 euro per month. So the cost for one quick call shouldn’t be an issue. Yeah, I would agree with that. I know you generally do not recommend free plans, but in our case, the free plan lacks the ability to contact candidates. So there is no value in the free plan other than testing. Thanks for the work and the podcast. This is a great question. I would try it. I would just try it. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen anyone do this, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try it. And I love stuff like this where you’re getting creative with it and you know that something moves the needle and you want to, how do you incentivize someone to do the thing that moves the needle where you can either offer ’em a carrot or a stick, you either penalize them for not doing it, or you offer them a gift or a reward for doing it. And in this case, I guess you’re kind of doing both. You’re penalizing ’em and saying, well, that part of the app isn’t available, but also you’re rewarding them right by saying, Hey, you get this feature or this upgrade or this whatever, by doing a call with us, I think I would try it. I just don’t know what else to say other than it might work. And just build it in a way that you can roll it back easily. You get it all in one commit and try it for two weeks, four weeks, whatever makes you comfortable. And my guess is you’ll know pretty clearly within a few weeks of rolling this out, I like the creativity Timo, and thanks for writing in. My last question for the day comes from James M. James appeared on this very podcast several months ago. He is the co-founder of talti and is also now a TinySeed mentor. So James asks, I have plenty of questions around hiring at the senior level. How do you balance cashflow with high salaries? At what point is a head of engineering more valuable than a senior engineer? And for product-led startups, what should team composition look like? So I’ll start with the last one actually. For product-led startups, that means not sales led, right? So this is low touch funnel, or you may have sales calls, but low touch funnel, what your team composition look like. So the answer is it depends on your competition. If you’re the only app in the space, you need fewer engineers because you need fewer features to stay competitive. But if you’re an email service provider or a CRM, you need a lot more engineers because you just need to keep pace or you will lose product-market fit. So it does depend, but usually whatever the founders can’t do, meaning if you don’t have any engineering founders, then your first hire has to be an engineer to build, to write the code, build the product. Your second hire and product led is almost always customer support because you will be a higher volume, probably a higher volume app with a lot of customers. And so you’re going to have a lot of emails and live chat if you offer it. And then after that, it just depends. That’s where you look at what’s your bottleneck, because I don’t, I don’t believe that there is a great rule of thumb. If there was, I would’ve tried to come up with it, but I don’t believe there’s a great rule of thumb around team composition with a startup because it really is what’s your next bottleneck? And that depends on so many factors like you’re pricing your market, your competition, on and on and on. To me, it’s that decision point. Every time you have enough money to hire that next person, you ask, what’s the biggest bottleneck in the company? Oh, we have too many sales demos. Great. I need to hire a salesperson. Or we don’t have enough leads. It’s like, great, I need to either hire a marketer or I need to replace myself, hire someone to take stuff off my plate. So me as a founder can approach marketing and sales. So that’s where I’ll leave the team composition. The answer is, it kind of depends, but that’s the framework of how I would build my team up. The previous question was, at what point is a head of engineering more valuable than a senior engineer? And I think, I know James is technical. I think to me as the founder, if I don’t want to be managing engineers, or at least technically leading them, meaning with the technical decisions, probably by the time I’m at three engineers or four engineers, I’m looking to either hire from outside or promote from within and ahead of engineering. Could be like Derek was at Drip, which was, you are the team lead and you’re technically leading them, but I was still managing all the team members at the time. But if you find a head of engineering who has management experience or you are willing to train them up, I mean, again, around three or four engineers, if I didn’t want to be managing engineering myself, I’d be looking for someone to take that off my plate because it is work and it’s one-on-one meetings, and it’s all the overhead of being a manager that you don’t necessarily want to have for the rest of the duration of running the company. And then James’s first question was how do you balance cashflow with high salaries? And I guess my answer is the same way you do with low salaries. If I’m hiring someone for two or $3,000 a month versus 10 or $12,000 a month, it’s similar math. It’s just different. It’s just a different amount. I tended to run my companies at about break even because that maximized growth. If I had raised funding, I would’ve started burning cash. I believe Asalt is self-funded, so they can’t burn. But for me, since the beauty of SaaS is that it is MRR and it’s recurring and it’s subscription, I kind of looked at if we grew five grand or 10 grand a month, that was enough for that next person because it wasn’t spiky. Now, if you are in a spiky business where maybe you’re taking a lot of annual payments or you have a usage-based component to your pricing, you just do the best you can. I mean, you can always bring in a fractional CFO to help you model stuff out. You could talk to AI about modeling stuff out. And to be honest, I’m guessing there’s a tool out there that could potentially be built for this. But usually what I see companies do, TinySeed companies say when they’re growing quickly and they’re trying to balance cashflow salaries, they get in a Google sheet, they project stuff out, and they do the best they can. It’s always scary hiring more senior level talent. This is why a lot of us resist doing it because it’s a big bet, and cashflow is a big concern. But oftentimes I find if you make the right choice on one of these risky bets, the upside is so asymmetrically in your favor that it can definitely be worth doing. So thanks for those questions, James. I hope that was helpful. That’s my final question for today. Thanks so much for joining me this week and every week.

If you want to be part of a world-class accelerator, receive the perfect amount of funding, mentorship, advice, and community. Head to tiny c.com/apply. And now let’s dive into the episode.  Colleen Schnettler:It’s just good to remember, for most people that don’t quit, it eventually works out. Most people, if you look at these success stories and you really dig into them, most people that don’t quit, it eventually works out.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the wild rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today in episode six of this season of TinySeed Tales, we’re diving back into Colleen’s journey. It’s been a whirlwind since we last checked in with twists, turns and moments of uncertainty, but that’s what makes her story so captivating. It’s a tale of resilience, ambition, and the pursuit of something bigger. So buckle up and join me as we explore the latest chapter in Colleen’s Adventure. And last week’s episode, Colleen and her co-founder Erin, had decided to go their separate ways and Colleen seemed to be quite stressed  Colleen Schnettler:Right after we recorded and we recorded so quickly on the heels of the co-founder breakup. I was pretty upset. You’re absolutely right. There was a lot of stress, there was a lot of anxiety in terms of what to do next. And my immediate gut reaction was, I need to walk away from this idea. I need to walk away from this name. I’m just going to do something else. I have other ideas. I’m going to pursue a different idea. And it had been a while since I had shipped code. And so I really was having a little bit of self doubt about what it takes to get an app from zero to paying authentication, the whole deal. And so I wanted to ship something and I wanted to go in a different direction. And so at that time, I had this idea, I used to be a podcaster, and we always had this problem finding and managing sponsors to the point where we literally stopped taking sponsors. The overhead was just too much of a pain. So I started going down that direction.  Rob Walling:Four months have passed since our last conversation, and Colleen dove headfirst into a new project called Get podcast leads.com, seeking to scratch her own niche and solve a familiar pain point in the world of podcasting. But as the dust settled, she faced the harsh reality of market viability. There was certainly a problem there, but would the market actually pay to solve it? So I asked Colleen how she launched it.  Colleen Schnettler:Launch would be a strong word. I think I tweeted about it once.  Rob Walling:Hey, that’s what we call an Indie hacker launch.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, well,  Rob Walling:Savage,  Colleen Schnettler:It  Rob Walling:Was brutal. Sick burn.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I don’t know. So I launched it, launched on Twitter, so I tweeted about it once and I did start DMing people. I know everyone podcasts. And so I am fortunate too that I actually know a bunch of people that own podcast hosting companies. So it was kind of cool to be able to go right to the source and talk to those guys. And what I found out when I was doing that is podcasting is a tough market. Low margins, podcasters are broke. So the fact that they would shell out additional money seemed unlikely. It could have been, I think it could have been a productized service, but still it’s not like if I’m going to do productized consulting, I should do it in Rails and make real money, not for podcasters who are like, I’ll pay you 20 bucks if you find me a sponsor that’ll pay me 200. The math of the business model just didn’t seem like it was going to work out  Rob Walling:And trying to figure out how to ask this question delicately, but could you have found that out before writing the code? And do you feel like you were, do you have a regret about spending the time writing the code or was getting your shipping muscle working again worth it?  Colleen Schnettler:First of all, Rob, you crush my soul all the time. It’s fine. You’re used to it like artist history. I’m used to it, so it’s fine. You know what? I think I knew before I built it that this was going to be the outcome, but building it for me was more about getting that muscle of shipping activated again because it had been so long since we had shipped because I hadn’t gone zero to full app in such a long time. I just needed to activate that muscle. And I had really wanted to play with the AI APIs and I hadn’t and was on the sidelines watching everyone, and I was like, I want to get into this. This is the future. And so the podcast thing was cool because there’s this huge podcast, API that I bought data from and then ran it through Deep Graham to transcribe and then ran it through OpenAI to try to extract sponsors. So I got to piece all these different APIs together and I had a lot of fun and it gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to ship something. And so I do not regret it, but I do think I already knew the answer because again, if you’re getting a podcast sponsor for 200 bucks, so what are you going to pay for that? Not much.  Rob Walling:Yeah, economics don’t work out. Do you think it is tasteless to say that podcast was your rebound relationship after Hello Query? It was like I knew it wasn’t going to work out, but to regret got you back in the game,  Colleen Schnettler:It’s totally appropriate. That is absolutely correct.  Rob Walling:Well get podcast leads.com may not have been the runaway success she envisioned. It reignited her so-called shipping muscle. It was a necessary step, a rebound relationship of sorts that ultimately led her to her next endeavor.  Colleen Schnettler:So then I was at the bottom of another trough of Sorrow. I was like, oh wow, this was a terrible idea, which I think I knew, but I really just wanted to ship something. So now you’re at the bottom of the curve again and you’re again like, crap, what am I going to do? And so I went back full circle to what is my unfair advantage here? And it’s hard with this. You have to separate sunk cost from Unfair Advantage. And so that was really my struggle is it was another time of a lot of kind of confusion, anxiety, whatever, whereas well as my unfair advantage that I have been immersed in reporting for two years or is that a sunk cost? And I just walk away and I realized that I still think that’s an unfair advantage that I have been immersed in this world of internal reporting. And it is a problem. People want to solve it. It is so clear. It is so hard as someone trying to start a business just to come up with a problem that people are willing to pay money to solve. And I was like, okay, if I take all of the complicated emotions around what I have already done going down the Hello Query route, if I separate that from the practical, logical, what is the business opportunity here, I still think there’s a business opportunity there. And I had been playing around with all these APIs, and so I was like, I wonder if there’s a way I can combine what I learned with GET podcast leads and the new tech out there and the original vision. And so what I have now, what I just launched, it’s AI assisted SQL Report builder. So it’s still called Hello Query, but it’s a different product  Rob Walling:And describe how it works, who would be a user at a company? And I know that I’ve seen the interface, it’s relatively simple, so describe what it does.  Colleen Schnettler:So I just launched it last week, so it’s still very early in terms of ideal customer. So what I am finding is when I first built it, I had thought it would be more for the developers to kind of remind you how to write SQL because we’re not all checking all the time, but everyone I have talked to wants to put it in front of their non-technical teammates.  Rob Walling:Internal  Colleen Schnettler:And internal  Rob Walling:Users.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, internal users. And so what that looks like is that looks like Jim from Accounting asks a natural language question that’s converted to SQL under the hood, it’s run against his database. And the product though is the reports, Jim, if those are the answers that Jim wants, he can then export it to CSV, export it to Google Sheets. He can schedule that report to be sent to him and his team every week rerun and sent. So the product is really all the reporting around the initial query.  Rob Walling:This reminds me of a quote that you said in the last episode where you said, looking back, we should have shipped SQL to CSV because we could have done it quickly and you and Aaron conflicted on that viewpoint. This feels like an AI assisted SQL to CSV or at least the vision that you had. You agree with that?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, a hundred percent agree. And the AI also, I wasn’t even going to ship that. I added that. It was almost going to be more of a marketing gimmick to be like, oh, ai. And then people were so excited about it and I was like, oh, right, okay, people are so excited about this, so this should be part of the offering. But yeah, that’s exactly what this is, is this went back to, I was like, you know what? Let’s go back. Let’s think about what I wanted to do. And I wanted to do little take off little bites of this problem, little bites at a time, put it in front of people, let the vision change as needed.  Rob Walling:And that’s something you and I have been talking periodically about how do you get just a little more data or a little more information so you’re not guessing and you’re not just thinking and ruminating because you and I can sit for two hours and guess what people are going to do. And in fact, I think it was three weeks ago, you and I had a chat and you were asking the question of, I’m concerned no one’s using it, it wasn’t launched yet and I’m concerned, are people going to be willing to hook up production databases? And on that call I said, well go ask them. Right? Should you just launch? It was a question, should you just launch? Go tweet it, I’ll retweet it, see if people do it. And what was that experience like for you?  Colleen Schnettler:First of all, amazing and amazing because for whatever reason, and I think it’s just the way that the speed at which we were working in terms of shipping product last year, there was a lot of thinking. It was like we have to ship the right thing the first time. So we have to have figured all of this out, which is terrible. But I do think it’s important to remember we got into that mindset because have you heard that thing? All advice is true. I dunno, it’s some famous article. It’s kind of like all advice is true because it worked for the person giving you the advice. So you’re always going to have people in the business building community who have both sides of this. You have the people who ship frequently and iterate. Then you have the people who are like, oh, we spent two years building this thing by talking to our customers and this thing is amazing and successful. And so I say all of that to kind of explain why we were in such this. We’re going to think the perfect product the first time. And so going back to this whole, one of the biggest reasons I think this particular product could fail will be because people won’t connect their production databases. And you’re like, well, you can just find out. I was like, yes. I can literally just find out. It doesn’t have to be. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. Maybe this group will, maybe this group, I can just ship the thing that I’ve built and then see if people hook up their production databases.  Rob Walling:And this is a luxury, there’s this often this debate of should I build an audience? And you’ll see Laura Rotor and Jason Cohen and I on Twitter the other day saying, not for SaaS. If you’re going to sell info products, build an audience. Not for SaaS, not worth it. There’s other things you should do, but there are exceptions to it. And I’m not saying exceptions that you should build an audience, but where it is nice to have a group of people who know who you are and whether that’s a thousand followers on Twitter or 2000 or whatever, you tweeted it out, here’s this thing, here’s a GIF of the screen, click here to try it out. And that is a really nice luxury. If you had no social media following and you had no network, no community, you could still do it. Hell, we’ve all been there. I did it 15, 20 years ago and you’ve done it yourself, but this sped up the process is what it did.  Colleen Schnettler:That’s what I was thinking as you were saying that this just makes the feedback cycle faster because I can access people who are my target audience faster,  Rob Walling:And I feel like it’s a virtuous cycle because it ties back into the shipping muscle comment you made earlier of you shipped and then you get really quick feedback and that feedback is the dopamine rush of good or bad, I’m doing something. And that’s where the build in public hashtag, I could take it or leave it. I think the biggest benefit of building public is not, Ooh, look at me and I’m going to get customers from this. I think it’s the feedback loop of really quickly, especially, well, if you’re building in public and you’re targeting the people who are actually listening, because the problem is if you make anything that’s not for indie hackers or developers and you put it on Twitter, you get indie hacker developer feedback and not, and usually, which is the opposite of what you actually want, but in this case, developers could feasibly bring it inside a company. Maybe they’re not the target user, but they at least know how it works.  Colleen Schnettler:And again, I think in the end, not that there’s ever an end, but I don’t know if I’ll be targeting developers or finance teams or C-Suites. But yes, the developers will have to touch it at some point and they can be the people, often the people being asked to pull these reports, so many people were like, oh yeah, I get asked to do this all the time. It’s such a pain, not my job. So they are for me, for them to pull it into their company.  Rob Walling:And so where do you stand today? Then you launched this thing three weeks ago, you got feedback, people hooked it up to their production database. Do you have more learnings and you know what features they’re going to build next? Is there more research thinking, data gathering to be done?  Colleen Schnettler:It’s tough. I mean, this whole thing is tough. If we all knew what to do, we’d just do it. I think I learned enough with a very small group of initial people who are interested to know what needs to happen next in terms of feature sets. So I am trying to, I don’t dunno if I’m going to go the whole week, marketing week, coding week thing, I don’t know if I’ll do that, but I am trying to make sure I stay in a cadence where I’m talking to people and I’m building and what I have learned. So I feel like there’s this whole concept with building a business, especially as a solo founder of Emotional Runway. I don’t know if we’ve talked about this, but it’s like this concept of, okay, so it’s this concept of emotional runway where this is a ultra marathon. This isn’t going to be done despite what people on the internet tell you, you’re not going to shift something in a weekend that’s going to make you a million dollars. It’s like highly unlikely. And so what I have found for me is I really, really enjoy being in the code. I like talking to people, but it’s very draining. So I’m trying to balance the talking to people and especially when you talk to people and you think your idea is so brilliant and they’re like, I can’t use it because of this or I can’t use it. I mean that’s demoralizing. That’s hard to come back from and come back from and come back from. And so what I’m trying to do is I’m trying to spend a week, maybe 10 days shipping a new feature that I know I need and then following up with these people who are trying it to see how it’s working for them. So kind of getting that cadence as I go forward.  Rob Walling:It sounds like a good plan. Shipping, often, shipping early shipping, often small pieces to piggyback on your emotional runway, I have this thing that I tweeted once and now I say it now and again and it’s funded. Companies fail when they run out of money. Bootstrapped companies fail when the founder runs out of motivation, and I would count, you’re a mostly bootstrap company, and what I see, what we see with TinySeed and outside of it is some people will have some traction after a year or 2, 3, 4 years. They’re at 4K, MR, 5K, but you just get so tired of doing it and you watch other of the success stories come out and you feel like, can I just, so that’s where bias towards action mostly working on the right things and getting enough of them correct that you have momentum because once you lose momentum, it’s demoralizing and you can only beat demoralized for so long. And so that’s where you’re shipping your shipping muscle that you’re rebuilding right now as well as the fast feedback cycle, I think is going to help with that motivation. It helps refill, it helps shorten your runway. No, the opposite. It helps lengthen your runway or helps kind of refill your motivation, your bucket so that you can keep going.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, absolutely. And whenever I start to panic a little like, oh my gosh, this isn’t working. Okay, I only shipped it two weeks ago, so it’s a little early for that, but I try to think about that, right? I’m like, okay, this goes on as long as I want this to go on, right? In a positive way in that yes, this needs to work on a relatively quick timeline because got to pay the bills, but also I can spend a year, I can spend five years, this can be my, I want this to be my future. I don’t want to go get a job and I want that so badly. I think it’s just good to remember for most people that don’t quit, it eventually works out. Most people, if you look at these success stories and you really dig into them, most people that don’t quit, it eventually works out  Rob Walling:One decision that I think you’re facing that still feels very muddy, and I want to bring it up because it is muddy. I want to show people listening to this that in hindsight, after this season airs and they’re like, well, Colleen was wildly successful with Hello Query. She always knew she would be. She knew exactly what to build. Everything’s great and up into the right, but looking back in the midst of it, you usually really are uncertain as to what you’re building, who you’re building it for. It’s very muddy, right? And one good example of that is right now you’re building this AI assisted SQL to CSV reporting engine for internal BI users, for people to query stuff. And that’s kind of where you have interest and that’s kind of what the product is today and you’re adding features on. But there’s been this other request, a few of them around, well, could this just tie into all of our marketing tools and allow us to query what Google Analytics plus Mixpanel plus Heap plus just whatever marketing stack to, I would love to just ask my marketing stack questions. How many trials do we have last month? How are they converting? Are they up? Just whatever people can imagine that. Maybe it’s a dashboard, maybe it’s not, but that is a different direction. Those two are not the same thing. The marketing query engine or the marketing versus an internal BI tool. What are your thoughts on that decision, and is it weighing on you? Are you uncertain about it? How is that going for you?  Colleen Schnettler:You’re right, they’re not the same thing. They’re two totally different directions, and I find both of them to be really appealing.  Rob Walling:In the world of startups, decisions are seldom clear cut. Colleen finds herself at a crossroads torn between two compelling directions for her product catering to internal BI teams or tapping into the excitement surrounding marketing analytics. It’s a classic case of the curse of the audience, a dilemma that highlights the challenges of navigating the murky waters of finding product-market fit.  Colleen Schnettler:On one hand, I think if I went the marketing route, people would just be, I think people in my network, this goes back to is it worth having a social media following? My people would be so excited if I put AI on top of your Google Analytics. They would be so excited. That is one direction and people have asked me for that. And then you have this other thing, internal BI tool, and honestly, I don’t really know. I am just taking my best guess. And my best guess is that one company in particular that has approached me about the internal BI tools, like a pretty big company. And I realize there is a demand for this inside big, bigger established businesses on the BI side, and that’s a customer that would probably pay a premium price for it. Whereas marketing data marketers have a lot of money, but I also think they have so many tools, so many tools that their disposal already, and they probably already kind of understand Google Analytics. So I don’t know if that AI on top of Google Analytics is as valuable. So that’s why I’m going BI tools, but I think this is a false, there could be a false demand signal. If I launched the Google Analytics thing, my people would be so excited. So that’s why I’m really torn on the decision, to be honest with you. I think I could go either way.  Rob Walling:I call that false demand, the curse of the audience. And if there’s two curses to it, one, you tweet it out or you email your list and everyone’s like, oh, I want to check out what they’re doing. And everybody’s really interested and then they’re not actually that interested to solve a problem, but they just want to interact with you. And then the other curse of the audience is when you burn through your entire audience, I did in the early days of Drip where it was like I have whatever, 10, 15,000 people on an email list and Twitter following and everything, and we launched this product that was kind of half baked. It was like MVP, and people looked at it and said, it just doesn’t do enough. And so a lot of churn and then we rebuilt. We had Drip 2.0, it was actually really good automation, all this stuff, and when I went back to my audience, they were like, yeah, we already took a look at that, and people didn’t want to try it again. Yeah, it was crazy. Multiple people said, oh, I didn’t, that’s what it did. Because they had all given me the benefit of the doubt the first time. So that’s why one of the reasons I wanted to call this out is A, it is a very fuzzy and cloudy decision, and neither you nor I know what the right answer is, but the right answer is to keep pushing forward and to try to get more data on both fronts and to make the best decision you can. Being a founder is making hard decisions with incomplete information, and you’re the perfect example of that right now with just incomplete information on all the fronts, and actually I posit that it doesn’t get any worse than when you are pre-product market fit. That is when you have the least amount of information and the most cloudiness, and that’s why it’s harder to save, write blog posts or build frameworks or write books around the pre product-market fit phase that you’re in, because it is just so kind of, it depends. You have to get more data, you have to make a decision. There is no, if you were like, Hey, I’m at 10 KMRR, I have 10 customers each paying me a thousand dollars a month, they are all either healthcare startups or IT departments of law. I’d be like, great, I can rock and fuel that. We can get that going. There’s an engine there, but until you get there, it can feel a bit like wandering in the desert and it’s just you got to keep going, got to keep shipping, and you got to keep gathering data, which is exactly what you’re doing at this point. We move towards wrapping up the episode, but I left the recording going, Colleen and I have been recording this podcast over the course of almost eight months, and I asked her how she was really doing  Colleen Schnettler:Fine. It’s more just like I’m still in the phase where I don’t know if this is going to work or not, and it’s like, so it can be a little bit hard to get on here and be like, yeah, this is totally going to work. I know I’m making all these decisions. All of that is true. But you don’t  Rob Walling:Have to say it’s going to work though. Don’t feel like you have to say, don’t even feel like you have to be upbeat. Say that. Yeah, you didn’t have to say that. You don’t have to fake it. You don’t have to even be upbeat. You could come on and I could intervene and you could be like, I feel terrible about this, and I’m super doubtful and I’m thinking about shutting it down. If you wanted to say that, say that. Be authentic to yourself. You’re not there. I don’t feel  Colleen Schnettler:Like you’re there. I’m not there. No, but it is talking about it. I’m like, all of the things I said are true, and I do feel good about it, but also, man, I guess it’s just we’ve been recording this podcast for so long and it’s like, what do I have to show for it? Right? I’ve been doing this for so long, it feels like, and it’s like, man, here I am again, not making any money.  Rob Walling:It  Colleen Schnettler:Just a little, it’s fine, but it’s just a little like, oh, you think after doing this for a year, I’d be a little further along  Rob Walling:At this point. I stopped the recording. I think most founders have experienced this feeling, wanting to be further along, wishing they had a clear direction to work toward. One thing is certain Colleen’s journey is far from over with each twist and turn. She learns, adapts, and keeps shipping even when it’s really freaking hard. Colleen stands at a crossroads torn between a couple of promising options. What decision will she make and will she find traction? That’s next time on TinySeed Tails.","PublishedAt":"February 20, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-759-tinyseed-tales-s4e6-does-ai-pivot-success"},{"Title":"Episode 758 | Do Free Trials Suck?, What Moves the Needle, and More Listener Questions (with Derrick Reimer)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 758 | Do Free Trials Suck?, What Moves the Needle, and More Listener Questions (with Derrick Reimer)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t45:09\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 45:09 | Recorded on February 18, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 758, Rob Walling is joined by Derrick Reimer to tackle a variety of listener questions.

This week I’m joined by fan favorite Derek Rimer, and we answer listener questions ranging from do free trials suck, how do you decide what moves the needle in your business? And two or three other listener questions before we dive into the questions. TinySeed, the accelerator I run for Bootstrap SaaS Companies is open for applications until February 23rd. Head to TinySeed dot com slash apply to find out more. And if you’re interested in the right amount of funding, amazing world-class mentorship advice and community, that’s c.com/apply. And with that, let’s dive into listener questions. Eric Rimer, welcome  Derrick Reimer:Back to the show. It’s good to be back. It’s been a couple of months, I  Rob Walling:Think it has indeed. I’m stoked to get into some listener questions with you today. I always hear after our episodes go live that people really enjoy our conversations and our rapport, so  Derrick Reimer:Awesome. Well, I enjoy having them.  Rob Walling:It’s good to have you back, man. So I’m going to dive into this first question from anonymous about entering a market with an established competitor and anonymous writes, Hey Rob, I wanted to first thank you for all you’ve done for the bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped community. You’re an inspiration to me and countless others. My wife and I love listening to your podcast Every chance we get, and you have inspired us to take this next step in starting a bootstrap SaaS business. So I need to pause there. There’s a couple things. Number one, I’ve been called Chief Instigator. Chief troublemaker. People will say, my spouse is mad at you. And I’m like, why? And they’re like, because you convinced me to start assessment. So I get the feeling that when Anonymous writes this, they’re both thanking me and also kind of punching me in the ribs, like, I will never forgive you for convincing me to go down this path.  Derrick Reimer:It cuts both ways.  Rob Walling:It really does, right? Yeah. Certain times. And then the fact that anonymous listens with his wife, I think is hilarious. This isn’t you, right? You didn’t write this question in.  Derrick Reimer:No, but my wife does listen to at least our episodes, and then I think she’s listening to Colleen’s episodes right now. We hung with Colleen  Rob Walling:Tiny tails. Oh yeah, yeah. It’s always fun when you know the person, right?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Cool. Oh, so we’ll continue. I hear this every once in a while that what he says is, my wife and I love listening to your podcasts, and I think they’re forcing their wife to listen. Do you love? And she’s humoring you. That’s kind of how I questioned it. But no, thanks for the comment there. So back to the email. My question is about how to launch a SaaS product in an established market. The market I’m entering is led by a company that has existed for five years in a relatively immature space. Although they have been successful, their business has not adequately invested in their software, which sounds familiar and often uses deceitful tactics to make the sale, which also sounds familiar. I believe I can catch the company flatfooted and lean on many of the strengths smaller startups have at their disposal, such as speed, design improvement, listening to my customers, et cetera. If I’m a new player entering the market, how do I properly address my competitor to prospective clients while being professional? Do you stay above the grain and focus on how my service and customer experience is superior? Or do I explicitly point out the limitations of the competitor, the outdated product design, deceitful tactics, high turnover? Are there legal risks I should be aware of? Thank you, Rob. I look forward to hearing your insightful insights. And before I toss it to you, Derek, to take the first crack, I want to read a brief poem, a brief disclaimer. I love to chat. I love to share. This is an original composition between me and chat, GPT. By the way, I love to chat. I love to share about startup’s growth and how to prepare. I’m not a lawyer, I don’t advise on contracts, filings, or legal ties for lawsuits, trademarks, taxes, to find a pro. That’s what they do. So take my thoughts, our thoughts, use them, right, but for the law, get legal insight.  Derrick Reimer:That’s the best legal disclaimer I’ve ever heard.  Rob Walling:There it is. Alright, so we’re not lawyers. We can’t give legal advice, but we are two guys on the internet who have opinions. So you want to weigh in on this one  Derrick Reimer:First? Yeah, yeah. So I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong here. I mean, you see a whole spectrum of approaches around this. My approach has generally been to try to craft the narrative around how you’re a better choice for your target market than the competition. So keeping it kind of framed positively on what you bring to the table and drawing helpful comparisons that speak to the customer’s underlying motivations. So with Savvy Cal for example, we tout ourselves as more thoughtful and more collaborative than most of the other players in the market, specifically our largest competitor. We have a comparison page where this narrative is sort of fleshed out a bit, and we claim that and we back that up with features that support that and things that are kind of unique to our product. So we’re really focusing on this is what we have to offer and we’re telling this narrative that hopefully resonates with you and it’s not necessarily a narrative that the other competitor could tell because they’re doing different things. So instead of saying, this competitor uses deceitful tactics, you could say, we will never lock you into X, Y, and Z, or we have a transparent cancellation policy. And if you’re talking to someone who has experienced those deceitful tactics with that other competitor, that’ll resonate in a particular way. But worst case, you’re just expressing something positive and noteworthy about yourself. So that’s how I think of it. I usually avoid those stupid checklists are skewed and biased where you get all the green check marks and everyone else gets all the red Xs. I think people see through those pretty easily. So I usually try to stick to more of a narrative around what’s the story of why your product’s better and keep it mostly focused on yourself, but obviously identifying those areas where clearly you’re casting yourself as separate from the others.  Rob Walling:I like that. I think there’s three. There’s a continuum of what you do here. Do I name ’em by name and put a bunch of negative press out about them? Or do I say nothing that maybe the two ends of the continuum? But let’s just take three points on that continuum. You’ve just named one, which is you’re not mentioning a competitor, you’re just calling out your pros. And I think that’s the most kind of chill, relaxed, non-confrontational way to do it. And if that’s, it’s totally viable and reasonable, I think it’s a good way. If that’s your personality, that’s how you do it. Let’s take a middle ground, which is, are you tired of deceitful sales tactic? You know what I mean? You are a little bit all up, but you’re not naming ’em by name. That might be in the middle. And that’s what we did. Well, no, the drip, remember when the drip homepage was just a long form sales letter and it did call out a few companies by name and it was like Marketo part, Infusionsoft. I think it was never MailChimp and HubSpot by the way, because I just always respected those founders. I respected the companies when I was write that marketing copy and get all angry, it wasn’t at them. We did name some folks by name on that homepage. And that of course is the third one is to come out and name people, not people I guess, but competitors, company names anonymous, asks, are there legal risks? There’s legal risks with anything. What’s going to happen? We’re not, lawyers can’t give advice, but what’s going to happen is if you put the company’s name on your website, they’ll either completely ignore it and not care, or they will come and write you a cease and desist or a huffy worded email. The odds of someone suing you without ever giving you any notice is really, really low. And we do see TinySeed companies from time to time get cease and desist of this manner. Or again, a huffy email from a CEO demanding, it’s a legal threat, but it’s just some CEO pound on the table. So we did it, we named companies by name, but the thing was they were so big we were nas just little gnats compared to them. And I think if we’d gotten big enough, they probably would’ve said something, but it was literally on our homepage. So it’s a risk tolerance thing, but I don’t think there’s a ton of risk. I agree with you. Having no, having a comparison page like us versus them to me is fair game. And that’s pretty common alternative to them. You’re trying to rank for stuff at that point in Google, and so people can compare. I agree with you about the check boxes. You can do the checkbox thing or not, but I think there’s a continuum here and a little bit of it comes down to your personality as a founder. You and I both know people who are just, they just give fewer s than you and I do is how I would phrase it. Or they’re just a little more aggressive or they like getting into arguments. They like sparring, they like to kind of have conflict. A friend of yours and mine, Matt Sing does not give a shit if someone’s mad at him. You know what I mean? And to his credit, that’s his personality. So him as a founder would probably go all the way to that third stage that I talked about, which is just name him and fight it and it brings him energy. For me personally, conflict and arguing or being called out. I can do it and I can handle it. I have the thick skin, but it is exhausting for me. And so I have to pick as I’m doing marketing or as I’m doing sales or thinking about this, I do have to think long-term, what problems do I want to create for myself? Starting a company, trying to get something off the ground, you’re building it, you’re creating a lot of problems for yourself just in doing that and which other ones do you potentially want to stir up is kind of the way I think about it.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, and I think that the other thing to consider is what is the brand you want to create, which is a little hand wave, but are you entering a space where you’re going to be the bulldog fighting everyone and you’re going to attract a certain type of customer who that resonates with? And other people will be totally turned off by that. If you’re just super negative and you’re just going after another company, then you’re sort of painting yourself. You risk painting yourself as a company who is just a response, a negative response to somebody else versus something that’s positive. And I think that that can paint you into a bit of a corner with your market as well. And certain people will just be grossed out by your marketing if it’s all kind of point finger pointing at someone else. So I think it’s like who do you want to attract? And it just comes down to strategy, I guess. Where do you think the opportunity is? Is it with and the industry too? I think there’s certain product spaces where it’s just inherently more combative and then others where it’s not. So it’s knowing your space, I think too,  Rob Walling:And knowing how your customers and potential customers view this competitor. There are some companies that are just despised, they’re just widely hated and it’s like they charge too much, they gouge us, their support sucks. I mean, let’s name a few names. Most people I know who interact with Salesforce in any way as a customer, do not like them. I’ve never actually been a customer. No, I have. Because we were paying six figures a year for Slack, for MicroComp Connect. It was outrageous. They were so hard to deal with and they were a pain in the ass. So if I was competing with Salesforce, would I throw shade at them? I would because I know that people don’t like them. I mean, Infusionsoft back in the day was the classic example. Anyone who used Infusionsoft, which is now called Keep, and they just sold the private equity for a one x less than one X error multiple, if I’m being honest. No one liked their software. It was just old and clunky. And so it was easy, it was an easy target and I never felt like I was being so aggressive in the copy. I keep saying it was you’re in my company. But I wrote the copy. I remember I writing those, the homepage in that and being almost angry for our customers. Customers would come over to Drip and they would just tell us horror stories. And I was like, that sucks. And that was kind of the motivation of like, ah, that how I justified it to myself. And I don’t know that it ever came off. I don’t know if it came off aggressive to people, but it felt justified. Now if let’s say I did that to Stripe, I think Stripe is pretty widely loved. I know some people have complaints on my Stripe account, whatever. There are some things on the edges, but compare Stripe versus PayPal. Most people don’t like PayPal. And I would say most people like Stripe. I like Stripe. Punching at Stripe in this way I don’t think would go over that well.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, it’s just bad strategy. I think that is a good point. If I were competing with Salesforce in some dimension, I mean whether you’re attacking them by name specifically or you’re attacking kind of the notion of the Salesforce type product where it’s like they’re going to try to aggressively gouge you and they’ve gone so far at market that they have highly optimized pricing, you will pay through the nose just sort of what they stand for. And they don’t have total control over that. It’s the reputation they’ve gained from the decisions they’ve made in the market. And so you’re putting yourself in the position of you’re an advocate for your customer and you’re telling the story that resonates most with your customer is the most important thing,  Rob Walling:Right? Anonymous asked several questions, but one of them is, do you stay above the grain and focus on how my service and customer experience is superior or do I explicitly point out the limitations of the competitor, outdated product, blah, blah, blah. And for me, we’re talking marketing website right now, but what if you get on a sales call? What would you do? So for me, I would want to find out if you’re currently a customer of that competitor, that’s what they’re comparing you against. You have to point out the differences. To me. Usually I would say something like, oh, you’re comparing us to X, Y, Z competitor, or you are currently a customer of X, Y, Z competitor. Would you like to hear how we’re different? That’s how I would phrase it. Would you like to hear how we’re different people tell us that we are much easier to use? Obviously our sales process is different. We’re month to month, not a year, whatever you point stuff out. I think if I was on a sales call and the prospect started leaning into, yeah, I feel like I really got hornswoggled in this hole. That’s a good one. Horn Sled 1887 called it once it phrased back, I dunno why you that I feel like I got really tricked on this thing that yeah, we hear that quite a bit. It’s a bummer. We definitely don’t do that. You know what I mean? Yeah. I would kind of almost go with the vibe of the person I’m talking to a little bit and that’s different. You can talk as much smack as you want on a sales call versus putting it in public on a marketing site. So I think those two things are different. So thanks for the question anonymous. I hope that was helpful. Our next question comes to us from X Twitter. This is Sander Fish at Sander Fish who asks often it feels like SaaS success is an accumulation of many small decisions and improvements over time. And me jumping in, I think any success, anything you build is you build a brand, you build a reputation, you build an audience, you write a book, you build. Yeah, I think you build any company. I think most things in life to get good at running or lifting, I think it’s all that small decisions and improvements over time. So I like this Sander fish’s question is how do you identify what really moves the needle? And I think we should limit this one to SaaS and not talk about all the other things I just mentioned because is really how do you identify Derek Rimer as founder of Sical? How do you identify what moves the needle in your business?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, it’s a great question. It’s a very broad question, but I guess I’ll start by riffing on the high level of this, which I think it comes down to, comes down to having a strategy, which is just the most simply put, how do you win at the game you’re trying to play? So this implies that what game you’re playing, are you trying to build a rocket ship unicorn? Are you building a TinySeed type scale business? Are you building a true lifestyle business? So it’s like what game are you playing to orient yourself around the kind of success you’re trying to achieve? And then once you have that set, then you can start working with a strategy of how do we get to the goal that I want? Do you want to work four days a week and spend a bunch of time with family? Like okay, that’s going to mean different decisions on moving the needle towards the success you’re trying to achieve. And then once you have the strategy, then you can tactical decisions in support of what you’re trying to achieve. So if you’re trying to grow really, really fast, then making some endeavoring down a path towards a channel that’s only going to send you a trickle of prospects a month, probably not a great decision. You need to orient your sites higher. Maybe that means you need to raise a little investment to be able to take a bigger swing at something. So I think it’s orienting what constitutes moving the needle for what you’re trying to achieve. And that’s something you have to define first. So sort of a non-answer, I’m not really answering specifically, but that’s how I think about figuring out what even constitutes moving the needle.  Rob Walling:And it really depends on the stage of the business obviously. I mean we can say it depends, but I do think there are certain founders I know who are better at identifying what moves the needle. And there are certain folks who are not as good, and this is that thing that a R and I talk about a lot about the TinySeed founders we see succeeding, they do a lot of things, they ship a lot of things relatively quickly and they’re right the majority of the time. And by majority, I say it on this podcast over and over, it is not 90%, it’s some number, it’s 60%, 65 set. I don’t know, you’re right, just enough, but you’re doing a lot of stuff. You’re not flailing, but you’re shipping high quality things quickly, whether that’s features or marketing or whatever it is you need to ship. The biggest question that I ask myself as any business I’m doing, whether it’s SaaS or whether it’s MicroConf or TinySeed, there’s always one and only one bottleneck is how I see it. And now I’ll take that back. There are usually, there’s one that is the most critical at the time, and then there’s five that are below that. But oftentimes you don’t even know what those five are until you fix that first one. And you don’t know if fixing that bottleneck will get you another 50 KMRR before you see another bottleneck or if it’ll get you $500 of MRR before that next bottleneck. It’s really hard, at least for me, I can’t see the second one, but in almost every business, every tiny C call or even when we’re doing strategy and r and I talking about how to grow TinySeed itself, how to grow MicroComp, how to whatever, make more revenue, get more people in the audience, it’s like what’s the next step? What’s the one thing? And if I’m thinking about SaaS in early stage, it’s like I have no one interested in buying this thing that I’m thinking about building that is the actual bottleneck. It’s not the product, right? It’s interested people, it’s sales, it’s marketing, it’s interest. And if I’m doing 10 KA month and maybe I’m not growing, usually you can look and be like, oh, it’s because churn is high. That is my single biggest buy, 11% churn. This is business on fire. I have to fix that before anything. And if I’m at 10 KMR, that’s probably lack of product-market fit. If I’m at a hundred KMRR and it’s 11% churn, that’s a whole different conversation. That’s my short answer is what is the bottleneck? I mean, we are right now with TinySeed, we’re launching a premium coaching plus masterminds and stuff. So it’s similar to the tiny seat accelerator, but it’s paid and it’s for 1 million a RR founders between what’s 1 million end up. That itself is something that we’re working hard on. And how do we decide what moves the needle? Well, we look and we’re like, well, right now we have no one committed to paying for this, so how do we get that? And then it’s like, and we need a coach or two and we need the program itself, which we know a lot from TinySeed. So those are the only two things we should be working on is finding more people and finding coaches. Once we have those, we can do anything else. And I think the biggest problem that developers especially and makers and builders do is they either don’t know or they kid themselves. They convince themselves that the bottleneck is actually the product and features. So fun. It’s the fun part and it’s easy to just be like, well, I’m going to tell myself that’s the bottleneck. But it’s like that usually it’s usually not the product.  Derrick Reimer:And I think it’s a good point that there’s usually one thing, but that one thing may set off a cascade of different sub things that need to happen. And so I think to take the example of fixing churn, it’s like that one comes up all the time where it’s like, well easy, just fix your churn. It’s like, okay, well that is much easier said than done. So then it means maybe you’re attracting the wrong type of customer. You have problems in the product where you’re not meeting their needs and so they’re churning out maybe you’re, so it could be prequalification, could be product problems, could be on and on and on, positioning, marketing, all this kind of stuff. So then you start breaking the problem down and you start busting this up into small little things. But I think the hard part can be you get lost sometimes in the forest when you do this and then you find yourself five months later you’re working on something and you’re like, wait, is this in service of the thing that is still the biggest problem? Are we still trying to reduce churn? Do we feel like churn’s in a good place? So I feel like the game is having that step back to reflect on what’s really bottlenecking the business, and then oftentimes it means six months to a year of work that is in service of that, but you’re going to kind of lose sight of that. You have to get down into the weeds on actually working the process. So I think that probably takes regular check-ins and reflections on what’s the state of the business? Is this still the biggest problem? Are we still prioritizing our day-to-day tasks in service of that thing? And that’s the challenge I think  Rob Walling:I agree with you. Yeah, it’s easy to lose it when it’s over a long-term like that. This is where, as much as I don’t like process long-term planning, any of that, this is where it makes sense to be like, Hey, what’s our plan for this week, this month, and this quarter, maybe this year? It depends on the maturity of the business. If you’re early stage, it does not make sense to do that, but with my businesses Micrograph TinySeed, they’re six years and 15 years old and they’re multimillion dollars and there’s multiple employees, it actually does make sense for us to sit down and be like, loosely, what do we want to do in 2025? What is that? We don’t have a strict annual plan of every week this happens, but during the year, I think we’ll do this. And then we start looking at quarters and breaking it down, and we do look at what’s going to move the needle. And if you’re a SaaS company and you’re early stage or even middle stage, it’s like I could see this is where you do say, well, 2025 is the year I conquer churn, and Q1 is going to be these things and month one is going to be these things. And that I think having some type of plan that’s written down somewhere could be a Google Doc with a few bullets or a spreadsheet or something that you refer back to, can be helpful to keep, as you said, forest for the trees, right? So thanks for that question, sander. I hope it was helpful. Most marketing agencies promise growth, but never move the needle. But Cory Haynes and the team at Conversion Factory, they know how to deliver results. Derek Rimer said that under Cory’s marketing leadership savvy cow broke into the market with a successful launch and steadily grew to several thousand customers. And Eunice coup of less annoying CRM said that their first a b test with conversion factory delivered a 20% increase in visitor to trial conversions within the first two months. Imagine having a senior copywriter, a designer, and a web developer at your disposal to turn every marketing idea into a reality. Head to conversion factory.co and mention this podcast when you book a call to get $1,000 off your first month. That’s conversion factory.co. Our next question is from Austin on how to sell slash market a SaaS before it’s built. So you can tell I did take a few early stage questions. This time I’ve been doing only the later stages, but I forget I’d bounce around considering this question is from August of 2023. Sorry, Austin, Austin’s like, we just hit a millionaire r bro, I don’t need you. We’ve  Derrick Reimer:Pivoted five times and we’re not even doing that.  Rob Walling:Totally. It’s not relevant at all. I still like the sentiment question. Hey Rob, thanks for all the great advice you put out. I hear from advisors that you need to start working on the marketing already before or while building the product. Download my free ebook, start marketing the day You start coding Rob Walling dot com and your email address back to Austin’s email. I’m working on a SaaS product together with a co-founder. He does the programming and design while I do marketing, product development and sales. My question is how do I sell the SaaS that hasn’t even been built yet? How can I build an email list when I don’t even have a product? Should I do marketing already? Now before the product is launched, we work on a talent management SaaS where businesses can put milestones that need to be satisfied in order to get to the next level. Example to go from programmer to senior programmer. This SaaS is pretty general to general. Any ideas for marketing this before it’s built? That would be very much appreciated. Thanks and best wishes. Austin, what do you think Derek? Rimer?  Derrick Reimer:Well, I consider taking the opposite and saying arguing that you should not market before you start coding, but I didn’t. The conflict, I didn’t think I could steal that. That’d be  Rob Walling:Great. Radio. Yeah, the April Fools, I’ll bring it back for April  Derrick Reimer:One. Yeah, so yes, you should market, you launch your product. I guess to be more specific though, I was thinking about what does this look like at the earliest stages and trying to think about what do I see working right now in the year 2025? I mean, historically it was like build a landing page, drive traffic to the landing page, and I think a lot of that stuff fundamentally still kind of works. I mean, I think there’s more noise than ever out there with so many different startups trying to get attention all the time. So I think just strategically, I would be thinking focusing initially on your network. I mean, presumably you have people that kind of fit this target market in your circles where you can, they have some kind of warm connection to you, even if it’s just like a LinkedIn connection or something. So people you can have conversations with to get their buy-in directly and then try to amplify this messaging in places where other people who aren’t in your direct network will be able to see it. Your casting vision about the change you want to see in the world, maybe you have a manifesto or something, and it’s like this is enough to gain someone’s a couple seconds of engagement as they’re scrolling by in a feed to catch their attention. And so you’re just trying to build some anticipation around the product you’re building. And then while you’re doing that, you’re testing positioning, you’re writing a landing page with the headline and maybe you’re driving some traffic to it. I think a lot of those tried and true techniques for testing out positioning still work.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think so. And you don’t have to sell it before built, but I do think you want to market it.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah,  Rob Walling:Right. I mean, selling is be like, all right, so give me money. Well, I don’t mean some people talk about pre-sales. I’ve never ever pre-sold anything. I have pre-market everything. And yeah, it is more competitive every year. It always is. And frankly, the tactics that I outlined in start small, stay small are 15 years old now. And so a lot of people know them. I mean, they came from other places too. I think a four hour workweek outlined that the smoke test and all that. I still put up a landing page for anything that I launch, including a new book with SaaS institute.com. As of today, as you and I are recording, this is a headline, an H two a sentence and an email capture form. And I get it that at this point I have an audience. I can just say, talk on this podcast and talk on Twitter and such. If I did not, I would still do exactly that, and I would still be talking on Twitter. I would be in founder Slack groups and on, I was going to say Facebook, but founders, it’s like where do founders hang out? That’s the real question that you hang out there. You have conversations, you do what you said, which is you get a landing pitch up, and then if you’re selling something that’s quite expensive, well, you actually want to get conversations. You want to get into conversations with potential prospects. You’re not trying to sell it. You are trying to find out are we solving a problem that they have? That’s usually the big early thing. If you know that they already have this problem and they are already paying for other software to do it, then the next thing you’re trying to figure out is, well, how are we going to be different? I don’t want to be a commodity. So that’s what you’re trying to assess out. We did this with Drip as we were launching. It’s like, well, we know people need to send email. There’s 300 other competitors that do it, so how are we going to be different than MailChimp infusions stuff to all these, right? And you did it with Avial where it’s like, well, we know that there are other scheduling links that exists. So I know that it’s a pain, but if I launch an exact clone of a competitor, I’m not. I mean, my little, I’ll get to three KMRR we, but you’re not going to build a great business if you build a commodity. So it’s as much, it’s customer development, it’s customer conversations, and it is, I think there’s a lot of learning that can happen here, not just marketing and selling  Derrick Reimer:When it’s in the vaporware stage, the goal is different. You’re still trying to inform the building process very much with reading what the market needs. And maybe hopefully you’ve gotten to the point where you feel confident enough to start investing in product that there is something here, but that’s not a place to stop. You need to continue the refinement of what exactly we’re building and who’s it for and how are we going to get these people. So as you’re proving out the product hypothesis with building, you’re also proving out the marketing hypothesis and the sales hypothesis with trying to read the sentiment as you’re putting this messaging forward.  Rob Walling:Last thing I want to throw in is if you put up a landing page, but I don’t have a product, what do you put on it? You put a headline that addresses the problem or the pain point that you’re fixing, and you put a sentence of text. My first book Start Small Stay Small, was a headline that said A developer’s Guide to launching a startup. And then I think it had one or two sentences of copy that was it, email capture, and it said something like, finally a book written for someone who wants to launch a product or someone who wants to start a company without 5 million of venture capital in your bank account. It was something that was it, and it was an email capture. Now it’s a book, it’s not a SaaS, but if I was doing a SaaS, that’s what it would be. The same thing of I’m solving a problem, this is it. Opt in if you want to fix that problem. And again, if there’s already existing solutions, then you can’t just say, I’m going to help you send email to your marketing list because a solved problem. It’s like, how am I going to be different? Why are the other solutions failing? So thank you for that question. Hope it was helpful. Our next question is an audio question from Noah Tucker.  Noah:Hey, what’s up Rob? This is Noah. I’ve been listening to your podcast weekly for years now. I’m the founder of a company called Social Snowball, which is an affiliate marketing platform for Shopify brands. And we are mid seven figures of a RR. And my question for you today is about free trials. We have always been very generous with free trials. We offer a standard 30 day free trial, and we’ll sometimes extend that if a brand asks or if we’re working with a partner and they want an exclusive deal, we’ll do a 45 day free trial occasionally, for example, and obviously this is great for the sales team, it helps get deals over the finish line that maybe are dragging their feet a little bit because it’s just an incentivizing offer, but it comes with downsides. And what we’ve realized is that a lot of brands during their trial period aren’t really taking onboarding that seriously and are kind of slacking off and losing excitement to launch. And they don’t have as much urgency to launch their affiliate program with us because my theory is that since they’re not paying, they just don’t really have that sense of urgency and they’re just kind of like, oh, we’ll get to it later, and then their 30 day trial completes and they’ll ask for us to extend it. And then sometimes it just continues to drag out until the brand just forgets about it or loses interest. And this has been a little bit of a challenge for us to work through. So I’m curious to what your thoughts are on considering just chopping the free trial altogether for a few months and seeing what happens and just kind of adjusting accordingly. Another idea I had is basically offering a refund for the first month. If the merchant, our customer completes all of onboarding. So if they finish the steps and then they won’t ask for a refund for the first month, we’ll give it to them. So there’s an incentive for them to actually set everything up or they won’t be eligible to get a refund on that month. But that’s just one idea I have. I’m super open-minded to anything you could suggest. And yeah, thank you so much for taking the time. I appreciate you.  Rob Walling:So I’ll start by saying I actually really like that idea of that Noah threw out of if they finish their onboarding, then their first month gets refunded. I think that’s pretty clever just to start. I hadn’t thought of it, and when he said it, I was like, that’s not the worst idea. But beyond what are your thoughts?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, so I think, I don’t know, free trials are tricky because it comes down to what is the goal of the free trial? So is it to give the customer time to set up, do they have resistance to pay for this until they make it through some kind of long setup process, or are you letting them kick the tires and learn about the product to themselves before they make a decision about going forward with your product? So they, in that preliminary buying phase, we’re still sussing out the options, or are you trying to actually give them a certain amount of tangible value before they pay? So you’re trying to say your customers refer a certain number of people before you’re obligated to pay us just to give away some value for free. Based on what you’re describing, it sounds like you have people coming in who are, you said not taking onboarding seriously or they’re losing excitement. So it sounds like they might be more of the aspirational type of customer where maybe they’re looking around at options, but they’re not ready yet to move forward with this. So I would be thinking like, well, is there value in letting them explore around or is that better that you control that process and just like, well, let’s watch a demo or have a live demo with us to explore this first before we get you into the product. I don’t know if it’s worthwhile to try to force them to have a stronger sense of urgency about the project. I mean, maybe it’s just not the top priority right now, but they’re doing a little preliminary research, so I dunno about arm twisting tactics to try to get them to do this right now. Although maybe they’re encountering something in the product where, oh, this is looking like it’s going to take longer to set up. So yep, this is maybe a for later type of thing. So that also could be something to look at. Are they getting tripped up at a certain point where like, oh man, I have these 10 different settings forms to fill out and there’s way too many decisions. Can you shortcut that? Can you make it easier to that minimum viable activation path? So there could be something in the product to look at too. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on with these trials, but these are some things I would think about.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that. I think you’re right on the money. I would give you a bullseye emoji. If we were on Blue sky, did you just invent an acronym? An MA minimum viable activation Path? Derek Remer, just coming up with the great thing. We might want to workshop that a little bit with chat GBT to get a better acronym.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, probably. Yeah.  Rob Walling:So yeah, you’re right. I mean social snowball is the H one is scale your affiliate revenue with creators and ambassadors. And so if you are trying to get an affiliate program set up, you can imagine you got to install some tracking snippet on a website. There’s stuff, and if you’re at a big bigger company, it’s like, well, I got to get engineering involved, I got to get it involved. When they say it, you’re like, this is only going to take six months. But having known the founder of ambassador get ambassador.com, Jeff, and seen him just deal with exactly this where it’s like, well, they’re not installing it. He was working with a big Fortune 500 company. He’s like, it takes them 90 days to install this line of JavaScript on a website of all the security and all the other stuff. So I’m not opposed to Noah’s idea of refund that first month. Some motivation if they get it installed or I’m sorry if they get onboarded. The real thing I would ask though is, is that motivating for them? If you’re dealing with a Fortune 500 company, let Target, they’re here in town and I was going to do affiliate tracking for Target. Do they care? Does the person buying care if they get the first month free? No, they don’t. But I don’t know what social snowballs customers are motivated by. So that’s the first question I’d ask. The other thing is, it is so common, especially if you’re selling to enterprise, and I’m not trying to make that assumption here, but let’s just dip into that real quick. Paid pilots, there’s a reason there are paid pilots and it’s like, you know what? Let’s do a 60 day paid pilot or a 90 day paid trial you could call it. And they do pay and then they have some type of motivation. It’s that time pressure. And this is always the thing where people say, well, I’m going to remove the trial or I’m going to remove, it’s not going to be a 14 day free trial. It’s going to be you log in and you can send X emails or you can book X amount of meetings. Well then there’s no time pressure and time pressure can be a good thing to get people motivated. And that’s kind of what Noah, I think what Noah is struggling with here.  Derrick Reimer:If it is a larger company and you’re like, okay, we need to get approval to pay for starting to do this thing, the question becomes, well, how far can we get without paying, without getting finance involved? So it could be a function of once you get the finance ball rolling, if you make that happen sooner, then that unblocks the project almost. So there could be some, when you’re selling to larger companies, these interesting dynamics start to emerge where I’ve heard Jordan Gaal talk about this too, how some have seen more success like asking for a large sum upfront from a larger organization because that means it’s taken more seriously or it’s viewed as a more legitimate. So  Rob Walling:Yeah, what’s funny is Jeff who started ambassador, which was affiliate management, I’m not going to say it’s similar to it, but it it’s the same category of this. After he sold Ambassador started his next company, and you know what it is, it’s onboard.io and the H one is onboard better and reduce customer churn. It was such a problem getting people onboarded. That was his number one thing. He could close these, he would close these big enterprise deals. And exactly the problem Noah’s running into is he was like, they’re just not getting onboarded and it’s a team. It’s like I got to get eight people at Target Best Buy, Verizon, whatever on the same page, and they’re all from different departments. And it’s like, how do you do that? His next SaaS was a tool just to do that because it was such a pain point for them. And it just shows you that this is probably not an easily solved problem, but it really does come down to what are the incentives and if you need to keep a time constraint and make ’em pay, I love coming back to the very first thing you said, which is what’s the purpose of a free trial? Because when you’re starting out in a new category or not a new category, but when you’re entering an existing category that’s competitive. People might want to poke around and see your product, and that’s what the trial’s for. But if you’re MailChimp, do you need a free trial? Everyone know how you send email, you don’t need a free trial. You just get in and you do your stuff. There’s just certain times where I just don’t think a trial is warranted at all, and I like that. Cool. So thanks for that question, Noah. I hope it was helpful. Our last question for today is from Xavier from France.  Xavier:Hi Rob. This is Xavier from France. I am working on this niche that I will qualify as a B2B C ish kind of niche, and I would love to have your feedback, your feelings about it and to know if it rings any bells to you. First of all, this niche has some good qualities that you mentioned. It’s small enough for big player to not care about it. It’s targeting to help people in their main job in the job with which they make a living. But my concern is it’s this kind of job fueled by patient in which the salary are very low. And for sure, my product won’t help them to make more money. It’ll just help them to execute better the job to make them win a bit of time, but at the end of the month, they won’t win more money because of my products in any kind of way. Because of this, I think the price that I can target for my project can be more than between the five or 15 USD per month as another B2C solution. And this is where my concern is because as you said over time is not that good price range for any people who wants to bootstrap a company. So yes. So this is a bit my wonder about this and I would love to have your feedback about it. Just keep up the good job. Your show is amazing and your content helps me a lot. So see you soon and thanks a lot.  Rob Walling:So to recap, he said this is for people to help them at their day job, but that the day job has a low salary and it won’t help them make more money. It will just help them execute a better job of what they’re doing to win a bit of time back to be more efficient. And then he says, I think I can charge between five and $15 per month. So he’s asking for feedback. What do you think?  Derrick Reimer:Sounds like a really hard road. I’m gathering that this is sort of, he’s describing this as B2C, but in a business context. So they’re using it for work. It’s not just for personal life stuff, it’s for work life stuff, but it’s sold. He’s imagining selling directly to the worker so that they can improve their productivity. I’m assuming it’s probably some kind of productivity thing, which I would say this sounds like almost zero willingness to pay. This sounds like a free, something you would install for free on your phone, free mobile app or something. I don’t know. I mean, one thought that just occurred to me is if this does benefit the business, is there a way to sell this to the companies that are employing these people? Because now you’re improving the productivity of their workforce and it’s not an expense that’s on their dime. But again, not knowing what it is, I’m not sure if that’s at all feasible for this, but I would be thinking how to make this more B2B, because trying to sell directly to the consumer sounds like a really, really tough road.  Rob Walling:Yeah, me as well. I mean, this breaks pretty much every rule of anything I would launch ever again in my life. It’s just a low price point B2B two B2C ish. So I agree. Can you sell to the business? The other question that I had about this is, do these workers even care if they’re more efficient? Because a lot of people just don’t in their day job. Some people care and want to get better, especially if you are a sole proprietor, you run the business. But then that’s back to being a business owner. And that’s not what he’s saying here. If I’m an auto mechanic or I am a dental assistant or a nurse’s assistant or a construction worker, and do I care if I’m, I, of course always cared if we’re more efficient, but we are entrepreneurs. That’s why we we’re kind of built a little bit different. But most of those people in those roles really think, man, I wish I could get more done in this day. I don’t know. I genuinely don’t know. And so are you solving a problem no one has or no one cares about?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I mean if he says it doesn’t lead to them making more money at all, and I’m like, well, that’s the problem. That sounds suspicious. I mean, even if there was some kind of vague tie of if they can prove to their employer that they are this much more efficient, then they have become more valuable and therefore should be ultimately compensated more in some fashion. But he made it very clear, this probably won’t have any link to their compensation, which is a good tell that the business won’t really value this. They won’t necessarily value  Rob Walling:This. Yeah, it’s hard to weigh in further without some specifics because it’s not detailed enough, I think, to really offer strong opinion. But that was it from Xavier. I hope that was helpful for you.

Before we get into the episode, applications for my SaaS accelerator. TinySeed are open from now until February 23rd. If you are bootstrapped or mostly bootstrapped SaaS founder and you’re interested in the perfect amount of funding, mentorship, advice, and community, head to TinySeed dot com slash apply  Colleen Schnettler:And I know what I want even though I have failed at it over and over and over.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the wild rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. We’re back with Colleen Schettler for episode five. Colleen is a developer, entrepreneur and co-founder of Hello Query. Last time we spoke, Colleen and her business partner Erin, were at a turning point in their business relationship and since then, Colleen and Erin made a tough decision about the future of the business. I’ll hand it over to Colleen to explain.  Colleen Schnettler:So what we had done in the past two weeks is we had actually hired a contract Laravel developer to help Aaron to speed up the development process. We had agreed that we would have an MVP of Hello Query to put in my side project, simplify upload on Monday. I had expected it to be done and he told me it wasn’t, which is okay. Estimating software timeline requirements is very, very hard. But then he told me that when he sat down to code on Hello Query, he just could not summon the energy for it. He said he was burned out and he would just sit down at his desk and he would just feel an overwhelming sense of dread and burnout’s tough. So many people in our community have experienced it, and so I said maybe if you came to some customer calls, because I get a lot of the positive dopamine endorphins, the one doing all the customer calls, and so I asked him if he wanted to join me on these customer calls and he said no because he was concerned that would just increase the pressure. Now, it’s not only do I have Colleen to answer to, but I have all these customers, so I took a beat too because my question is do I beg him to stay or do I let him go? Right? And so I had to decide because here he is on the phone telling me he’s totally burned out. He has no excitement for the product and he just can’t bring himself to work on it. So what we landed on that day was we landed on why don’t we both take a break, think about what we want and come back and talk again in a couple days.  Rob Walling:During that time, in the back of your mind, did it feel to you like it was going to end or did you still have that maybe Aaron will reconsider and decide, oh, I really do want to be part of this.  Colleen Schnettler:I knew he was going to leave. Have you ever heard that vending machine breakup analogy like breakups are shaking a vending machine, knocking over a vending machine. You have to shake it a few times before it falls over, and I was like, oh man, we’ve already had this conversation once. There’s a disconnect in terms of the speed at which we want to work and what we are trying to do. So maybe if I was just more chill, maybe if I wasn’t trying so hard and I was just like, it’s fine. Let’s just hang out and we’ll just do this at whatever speed we do it. Maybe we could have made it work, but  Rob Walling:Sounds like a recipe for a really successful startup. I’ll just chill out and I’m sure things will take care of themselves.  Colleen Schnettler:So I think that I knew we were going to part ways, but also, I mean it was ultimately his decision, but I didn’t beg him to stay.  Rob Walling:So now Colleen is left without a co-founder, a difficult spot to be in during this time. She recorded a voice memo titled it Crushing Failure and sent it to me.  Colleen’s Voice Memo:I don’t really know what to say. I’m in a position where it feels like I have no options for this business, and it feels awful, especially after taking funding and having people bet on me and for me to be in this position where I can’t execute and it doesn’t even feel like I did anything wrong. It just feels like my partner and I fundamentally wanted different things and we thought we wanted the same thing. We’ve been in TinySeed for almost a year now, I guess 10 months, and we’ve come so far in this space. So to walk away from it right now, gosh, the failure level feels massive. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should do this alone, but if I’m not going to have my business partner, it’s his tech stack. So it’s almost like, no, it’s definitely I need to have a product and a tech stack. I understand, and I’m a senior developer, so should I spend the next three to four months learning or should I rebuild the whole thing in Ruby on Rails? Should I shut this product down? Because reporting, I actually don’t care that much about reporting or should I recognize that I have put so much time and energy into this space and I have people that are interested. I don’t know what to do, but it feels like crushing failure  Rob Walling:In that amazing crushing failure. M four A. You mentioned the word failure. Why did you use that word?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, is that not exactly what this is? I mean, what have we been doing for a year, Rob? We’re getting to the end of our TinySeed year. Everyone’s like, what did you do all year? And I’m like, I don’t. No. What did we do all year? Sorry.  Rob Walling:No, no, this. That’s how it feels. Yeah,  Colleen Schnettler:I have been working. It feels like we’ve, both Aaron and I, because he’s been putting in a ton of time working so hard and we have nothing. I even walked away from 20 KA month when we were consulting. I shut that down.  Rob Walling:I was going to ask about that. If you regretted that at this point,  Colleen Schnettler:I mean, if I hadn’t shut that down, that wasn’t just 20 KA month, that was infinite KA month, I could just keep scaling that up indefinitely. I could have a whole freaking consultancy right now. When we raised the TinySeed money, I made the decision to walk away from the product ties consulting and that, like I said, that was a significant amount of money. I cut my legs out from under me, but you know what? I do not regret it. I do not regret it. I would rather fail this way than still be doing that stuck in limbo forever.  Rob Walling:That’s really good to know about your own decision.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah,  Rob Walling:It would be terrible to feel like huge waves of regret of like, oh, can I go get that back?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah.  Rob Walling:It doesn’t sound like you want it.  Colleen Schnettler:I think that this is the most important thing and we get wiser as we get older and all that stuff, but to get what you want, you have to know what you want and I know what I want even though I have failed at it over and over and over.  Rob Walling:Now, hypothetically, let’s say you had not raised money. Given where you are now, what do you think you would do? Would you keep going with this or would you shut it down and look to get a job or do something else?  Colleen Schnettler:The problem with this idea, hello Query is this is really Aaron’s idea. It’s his baby. He’s the one who experienced the problem and he’s the one who has a vision on how to solve it. And so to take his vision and run with it, I don’t know if that is something I want to do. I don’t know if it is the right product for me. So if we didn’t raise money and he decided not to be involved, I can almost say I would not do this without him. For sure.  Rob Walling:I feel like, tell me if I’m wrong on this. I feel like you have a particular gifting and or desire to solve problems for developers and or product people. Would you say that’s accurate?  Colleen Schnettler:I think that is an audience I know, so that is probably why I have gravitated to that particular audience.  Rob Walling:But it’s not necessarily something that you would pigeonhole yourself into?  Colleen Schnettler:I wouldn’t because we spent a first year before we hooked up with TinySeed, we spent a year trying to sell this as a Ruby gem to developers, but they’re a hard market to sell to  Rob Walling:Because you mentioned several things. You mentioned it was Aaron’s idea you were going to work on it with him and also you’ve done it. So have you been there, done that kind of bored, not interested in it? What are the factors?  Colleen Schnettler:The problem is deep and complex, and there’s a lot of data, not only data privacy, but data authentication issues in this space. And one of the things I realized rewatching the customer interviews is people don’t want reporting off of a single table. They want their users to be able to go in, see what data they can access and work through these tables to get that other data. And that’s a hard problem to solve. I have no idea how to solve it. And then you’re in this kind of scary, not even regulatory but scary space where if you screw it up, you can really screw it up. And so I think my concern isn’t that I can’t do it, it’s that the product Erin and I had envisioned, it’s not the right solution. I can already tell you from the customer interviews what we have 50% done, that is not the right solution right now. It’s this iframe that loads in your site that your customers can build queries in. But I know the first thing people are going to say is, this is customer facing. I don’t like the way it looks. What? It loads an iframe. So now, I mean, it’s not actually that easy. There’s technical problems that I think, I mean, I’m sure I can solve them, right? All technical problems are solvable. I just think the layers of this problem and our solution do not match. And so unless you really, really care about it, I think it’s a hard sell to figure out what the right product is in this space. I don’t think we have it.  Rob Walling:That’s interesting. So not only have you lost your co-founder, but what you’ve built to date you don’t have confidence in and you feel like you need to start over without a  Colleen Schnettler:Co-founder. That’s why.  Rob Walling:Yeah,  Colleen Schnettler:And I feel like if we had still been together, we would’ve figured it out. It’s a hard problem to solve. I don’t know how to solve. It feels like the reasons not to do it are stacking up  Rob Walling:A lot of headwinds. Yeah. The way I see it, she has three options. Colleen could go it alone or find a new business partner, rethink the approach and bring Hello Query to life, or she could pivot within TinySeed. We’ve certainly seen our share of entrepreneurs who pivot their business. It’s not the most common thing, but it’s also not unheard of. So I pose these options to Colleen. Where are you with that decision? What are you thinking?  Colleen Schnettler:I don’t know. Robert is so hard to decide because I watched the customer interviews and I’m like, clearly there is a problem here. So there’s something we’ve hit a nerve somehow. Can I solve that without Aaron? But then another part of me is like, man, it’d be nice to walk away from filters and sequel. I have been doing that for years and years and years, and I cannot make it work.  Rob Walling:I’m kind of sick of it.  Colleen Schnettler:I’m kind of sick of it. Maybe I should do something else. Why not? These past eight months, I mean, my skillset has just exploded, so I just need an idea and a little bit of luck and maybe I can do something else. It’s an interesting position to be in because when you see other people in this position, you want to play your tiny violin for them. You’re like, oh, you have funding and no idea how hard for you, and now I’m in this position and I’m super stressed.  Rob Walling:As you think back over the past six months, 12 months, is there something that you wish you’d done differently?  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, I think originally when we had talked about this idea once we got rid of our consulting arm, we had talked about starting, which is SQL to CSV and Iteratively building. And for reasons that I’m still kind of unclear, I couldn’t get Aaron to do that, and I think part of it was he felt, I don’t want to put words in his mouth, but he felt like that wasn’t well aligned with his vision, and so I feel like we should have shipped something faster. It should have been SQL to CSV instead of going with this huge vision where we’re going to solve all your problems. Well, gosh, it’s so cliche to say this out loud now, but we should have shipped SQL to CSV and because Aaron and I, we maybe didn’t, I don’t want to say we’re conflict, but when you have a personal relationship with your co-founder, you don’t. I was always really worried about pushing him too hard and we broke up anyway, so I should have pushed him harder eight months ago. We should have broke up eight months ago. I learned a lot about communicating from him, which was great. Lessons I will take, if I ever take a co-founder again, lessons I will take forward with me. Business relationships are hard, and it’s not awesome the way this turned out, but also people have real lives and we like to pretend that’s not true, but we’re not 22 living in a van by the ocean, right? We’ve got kids and lives and sometimes people’s priorities change and I’d like to believe that he and I handled this maturely and we separated with class and we are still friends, so I do not regret it.  Rob Walling:There’s a reason entrepreneurship is often equated with a rollercoaster ride, and while it may seem like Colleen is at a standstill dips, this are all part of the journey. Next week we’ll follow up with Colleen and see where she’s taking Hello Query.","PublishedAt":"February 13, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-757-tinyseed-tales-s4e5-founder-breakups-crushing-failures-and-the-future"},{"Title":"Episode 756 | Why Great Product Management Is Critical for Your Startup","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 756 | Why Great Product Management Is Critical for Your Startup\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t43:10\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 43:10 | Recorded on February 11, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 756, Rob Walling interviews Brendan Fortune, Director of Product Management at Customer.io, to explore the skills and frameworks for effective product management.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and today I have the pleasure of talking with a good friend of mine, Brendan Fortune, about how to be a great product manager. And you might be thinking to yourself, well, I’m a founder. I don’t want to be a cog in a wheel at some large organization, product manager. That sounds like a title of someone managing things that doesn’t matter, what being a product manager is about, making decisions of what to build, how to build it, how to market those, how to frame them, how to explain them to the rest of your team, and how to explain it to the world at large in a way that gets people interested. Product management is a skill that any SaaS founder needs to be aware of, and I think all of us can improve on that. Brendan Fortune was the first person aside from the two founders of Drip, to make any product decisions about what went into Drip, what was built and how it was built. Brendan has been a product manager at several companies. You’ll hear us kind of talk about it in his intro, but we have a great conversation not only defining product management, and you can hear me at the beginning, kind of prod him like what is product management and how should someone think about that if they’re a founder? But then we get into a framework that Brendan introduced me to that involves building a flywheel and helping that decide how to make your users more successful and how to make your product more successful. If you listen to this episode and you decide you have product questions, things about how do I decide what to build? How would I think about being a product manager, how can I hire a product manager, how can I become a product manager? Anything around product management, any of this stuff. If you want to send those in to Questions at startups For the Rest Of Us dot com or you want to click the ask a question and put product question in the subject line, I will invite Brendan back on if we have enough questions to do a full show before we dive into our conversation applications for my SaaS accelerator, TinySeed are currently open. We will be having a live q and a if you’re interested in applying or just have questions for us on February 13th at 10:00 AM Eastern time. For more information, head to TinySeed dot com slash apply. And if you’re ready to apply, same url, tiny c.com/apply. If in doubt, fill it out.

Brendan Fortune, welcome to Startup For the Rest Of Us. Hey,  Brendan Fortune:How’s it going?  Rob Walling:Great, man. It’s good to have you on the show.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, I’m excited to be here. I’ve listened for so long. We’ve worked together. We played DD for so long together and now finally on the show, the pressure’s have,  Rob Walling:He’s been waiting. Were you checking your mail every week? Where’s  Brendan Fortune:The invite  Rob Walling:To come on startup  Brendan Fortune:Service? I was about to rage Quit this friendship and move Right on.  Rob Walling:I know, I get that a lot. Yeah, I get from a lot of people. So as folks probably heard in your intro, you and I worked together at Drip after the acquisition, after we sold the lead pages and became the company. You were the first person aside from Derek or I to ever make product level decisions about Drip. That’s the honor. That’s tombstone level. Yeah, that’s what you’re printing.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, I’ll drop that right on my tombstone. I mean, it is kind of cool when you phrase it that way. Yeah, I’ll take it.  Rob Walling:And your role today is your title?  Brendan Fortune:I’m a director of product over@customer.io.  Rob Walling:All right. And most people listen to this podcast will know customer.io. I wanted to start us off though with a brief kind of discussion definition of product, that role, that department, because back in the day when I was bootstrapping early, let’s say 2005 to 10, I’m a developer. I’m trying to build stuff people want and just trying to make enough money to pay my house payment product. That role, that department didn’t, I don’t know if it didn’t exist or I just didn’t know what the hell it was. It probably existed at Proctor and Gamble, right? For toothpaste, there’s some product owner or product leader or QuickBooks, maybe Intuit, they would have a QuickBooks product leader. I’m sure back in the day Microsoft, there were program manager program, maybe they were product. Yeah, there were product managers. Yeah, of course there were in the nineties for Excel and Word and all that.  Brendan Fortune:There were even as far back in HP I think in the nineties. But of course product doesn’t mean the same thing.  Rob Walling:And so my question then I remember starting to hear this term as I was building more SaaS companies and it just became much customer success kind of sprang out from nothing to being a role. Now in a department, I feel like Product did that with SaaS and I don’t know the history of it that well, but what I want to do is for the 25% of the audience, it’s like of course we know what product is, we know what project manager, product owner, all that, but there’s a good chunk of this audience. I think that’s kind of like whether they’re a solo developer, whether they’ve only worked at small companies, whether just the founders, they are by default the product managers and they don’t call themselves that. It’s like, oh yeah, the CEO and the CTO of our five person company. They make all the product decisions. What does that mean? What does product do and what are product decisions? Talk us through this as someone who’s been in it for what, 15, 20 years?  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, I think the segue from a founder is probably the simplest way to understand it because what’s one of the things the founder does? Well, a founder has to understand their market, they’ve got to understand their product area, they’ve got to understand their customers. They’ve got to be thinking about pricing and packaging and how they’re going to make money at the end of the day. And that’s very much what product managers do once a company or product has scaled to the size where one person just can’t do it all. There’s just too much going on and not even that they can’t do it all, but they’re just not going to do it as well. There’s a limit to the capacity of details that we can ingest as companies grow and products grow. so@customer.io for example, we’ve got eight product managers now I think actually we’re about to be up to 10 writing two more later this month.  Rob Walling:And I often describe product as this is my very how I always, it’s like I have a lot of gut feel and I have a lot of very shorthand things that are not necessarily official, but I’ll say product decides what gets built next, what features often in what order, often how they’re built, meaning what do they look like, how do they operate, how do they interact with other areas of the business, how are they going to impact pricing, which tiers do they go in? And then there’s even beyond that, there’s product marketing, which I had never heard that term before. You came on with Drip and then you and Tedesco and the execs were telling me these things and it’s like, oh, is this how they do it at big companies? It’s like, yeah, that is. And so that was the merging of me being in the small companies, the small SaaS and hitting that. So that’s my loosey goosey run on sentence definition of it. How do you think about it?  Brendan Fortune:I think that’s right. And the reason I pause is because there’s a lot of debate in nerdy product circles about whether it is the product manager who makes certain decisions versus kind of guides certain decisions. And that weasels is part of why don’t want to, I’m not sure the details are actually useful, but at the end of the day, the product manager is accountable for the features that ship and whether they are actually adding value both to customers and to the company. And so that does involve what are we going to do first? What are we not going to do? Which are, it’s like 95% maybe more of the decisions that have to get made. So I think I’d agree with that. Product marketing, I don’t know if you want to go deep on that, that’s just really splitting hairs, but product marketing is kind of a fascinating dual head of product management and the most concise way I’ve heard it described is product management is listening to the market and reacting and building and product marketers are speaking to the market. So both of them need to understand what customers very, very at a detailed level, they need to understand, have an opinion on strategy and personas, but one builds stuff and the other one tells stories.  Rob Walling:And this is the thing, this is why it’s hard is because again, there’s a chunk of people listening to this podcast that either do work at big SaaS companies or have seven or eight figure SaaS companies. So I don’t want to act like everybody here is doing 10 KMR mri. That’s not true. But a lot of folks, if you are a founder or two co-founders of an early stage company, I think of Derek and I with Drip when we were doing 20 KA month product management and all the decision making he and I made together, that was actually a huge chunk of our job. What do we build next? How do we build it? Let’s collaborate. We got an architect, we’ve got to get the naming right, blah, blah, blah. And then as we were getting close to say, launching that feature, the automations or workflows or whatever, we’d get together and I was like, alright, we’re going and this is when product marketing happened. But I didn’t know that what it was called, but it was like we got to communicate this to everybody, to all the prospects in our pipeline. I want to communicate it to the world. I’m going to tweet the shit out of this. We’re going to email everybody. I want to try to get on podcasts and talk about workflows. Now we didn’t have a later on, you have a sales team, a customer success team, a customer support team, and you have to keep all of them appraised. There’s some internal product marketing happening right now to me was we had one email support guy. I was like, Andy, here’s a feature. Try it out. Here’s a loom. Tell me if you have questions. That was literally our internal communication and the sales, the customer success. We would circle up in a room, we’d walk it through, Derek would walk us through for 10 minutes. Any questions? No. Start integrating that in your thing, right? It’s easy when there’s seven of you, but you imagine again as a listener, if you’re a hundred person or a 500 person or a thousand person org, someone has to be like, Hey, this is what’s happening and how do we communicate this to everybody? And that’s again how I think of product marketing. Is that right? That’s just my image of what it is.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, I think product marketing, like product management, it depends a little bit company by company, but when I was at GoDaddy before, which is a much larger company, product marketing was responsible both for the internal training and communications and the external. And again, the more people you’ve got, the more time and energy needs to go into helping others help you. They’re going to support the feature that you’ve shipped. So if they don’t know what it does or how it works or some of the details, they’re not going to do a good job. And that’s going to translate to the customer experience. Of course, if you are building features that are intuitive for enough customers, then there won’t tend to be as many support requests. But yeah, I mean the way you’ve described it I think is exactly right.  Rob Walling:Now we’re going to play a little game. You and I are each going to answer a question, but you’re going to answer first so that I can answer with mine second and I can say, that’s why you’re wrong. No, I’m not going to do that. Just so people know, you and I have known each other now for 10, eight years and we play d and d every two weeks. So there is a lot of rapport, so I’m going to be jokey and stuff. Don’t let it make you uncomfortable if you’re listening to this and being like, why is Rob being such a jerk to this guy? Question is though, before we get in, because I want to get it, we’re going to get into pricing and flywheel and how I often say on this podcast, pricing is the number one lever in SaaS. And if you it up, you can have an amazing business that should be a million dollar business. That is actually a $200,000 business. I’ve seen companies do that. And you can do the math, it could be a 10 million versus a 2 million. It’s pretty easy. So we are going to dig in to how product and product management and all the decisions around that integrate with pricing and flywheel. But before we do that, I want to ask you, when do you feel like a SaaS company should have its first product manager that isn’t the founder?  Brendan Fortune:There’s a rule of thumb that I use to answer this question. I’ve gotten it from a few founders. Customer io works with many founders, drift did to, and it is, when can you afford to pay an employee 120, 130,000 a year? Now I’m assuming USD, and it kind of depends on where in the world you’re hiring, but when can you afford? And that’s not the only question, but it’s a pretty good indicator. If you’re not at that point, then you don’t need someone else trying to get close to details. You need to be closer to the details yourself. Because as we’ve been talking about, a lot of what founders do is what product folks do. Product managers are going to come in and do for you. So that’s the usual rule of thumb. And then you can kind of take that deeper depending on, well, okay, but what if I got these projections or what if I have this specific problem that I want to offload to someone else like project management or something. Is that okay? So you can go more detailed, but product managers, the way that I have experienced it across my career, you don’t need them until you’re doing, you’re doing pretty well.  Rob Walling:My rule of thumb across kind of TinySeed companies, they will ask me or even just I’ll get a question on this show, and it’s a rule of thumb can be broken, is that you don’t need a product person before a million a RR. And usually I see it between one and 2 million somewhere in there. And it depends a lot on the product. Look, there are some very simple products out there that are kind of a feature or a collection of a handful of features. And do you need a product manager? No. And then there’s customer.io and Drip and HubSpot and Salesforce and these very complicated. It’s like, yeah, you probably need one earlier, earlier than not. Similarly, my rule of thumb for when do you need kind of a head of marketing or someone to run marketing that’s not the founder, usually it’s between one and 2 million. That’s also my thing. And part of that is what you’re saying, which is well then you should have the budget to do that to hire someone good. They are going to be 120, 150 K or more. And usually you just are at a point where you can bring someone in from the outside because the product’s mature enough. It’s not that mature, but it’s way more mature than when you were at 240 KA year doing 20 KA month products. Still we need some founder level decisions at that point. It’s really, really hard. There’s still so much fuzziness around the decisions. And to piggyback on that, one of the things that I see non-technical founders struggle with is you get someone who’s a subject matter expert in the construction industry or in brick and mortar or in just whatever, we could name any industry legal. They don’t have a developer founder. So then they go hire either an agency or a developer and they hire the developer and they say, I have an idea for a thing that’s going to help legal people do this. And it’s like, great, what should I build? And it’s like, well build the thing that helps legal assistants do that. And it’s like, okay, let’s take a step back. Where will every checkbox, where will every setting, what will the top nav look like? I mean I’m preaching to the choir here to you and to everyone. Listen to the podcast of like you can’t just hire a developer and expect them to build an incredible product. Not unless they’re Derek Rimer. I know three in my life, you know what I mean? Who are developers plus really good product people? I’m exaggerating, they’re more than that. But you get the idea is that’s where as developer I think we often get that intuitively of like, oh, we’ve learned to build software, therefore it’s just a thing. You make decisions. And that’s why I never called it product in my head. It was just what to build. But when you don’t have that, you’re missing an entire skillset, right?  Brendan Fortune:And that’s how my career in product started. I was not an engineer, I was technical, I was more of like a cis admin. But it started because there was a really large gnarly project that required a lot of alignment building and coordin. It was a people problem first, I guess is my point. And when you get into product, there are lots of different paths, but if you’re coming in non-technical, it’s substantially different.  Rob Walling:So let’s dig into pricing and flywheel. When I asked you what you wanted to talk about on the show, a bunch of stuff we could go down. You mentioned how much pricing ties into product and I was kind of like, yeah, I guess it does. It is not something I would think of every day. But the moment you said, I was like, well of course it does. And I want to hear your thoughts on this whole concept because everybody struggles with pricing and everybody wants their pricing to be optimal, net negative churn, all the things I talk about, the cheat codes I talk about on the show. So why don’t you kick us off?  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, I’m really passionate about this topic or this framework that I’m going to run through because it’s something that helps not only with pricing but also with decisions about how you prioritize and even how you organize as the company grows. It’s this really amazing tool that you can do early on and it grows with you kind of just keeps on giving the foundation of it is this concept of a flywheel and that concept, I was using that word for maybe two or three years before I actually stopped and looked up exactly what it meant. So if there’s anyone else in the audience like that, you imagine a crank on a wall that you’re cranking with your hand and you crank it faster and faster and faster and at some point you let it go and it’s a self-sustaining crank at that point. You don’t have to put any more pressure on it, it’s just going to keep on rotating. So that concept is what the flywheel tries to embody. And the reason it ties into pricing is because if you can find a pattern of customer behavior that works like that flywheel where customers will do it over and over and over again and you can find a way to price based on that behavior, that’s how you can get some of the expansion revenue and the cheat code you were talking about with a net negative churn. That’s how you achieve that. And not all companies can pull it off, but particularly in SaaS, there’s a very good chance that you can, I think a lot can, and we, anytime you see usage-based pricing, that’s someone who’s trying to take advantage either of a flywheel or maybe it’s just a cost plus model where you’re like, well, I pay for these text messages to go out to Twilio, so I’m going to charge you for that. Now, I dunno, we could go into some examples flywheels sometimes that really helps. Why don’t we start with Drip because that’s a fun one we can both relate to and it’s very similar to customer io.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I know you have a diagram for this one, and what we’ll do is we’ll probably have it in the X Twitter snippet that we put out, but we will definitely take a still screenshot of it and put it in the show notes. If folks want to add to start up For the Rest Of Us dot com and look for, I believe this will be episode 752, possible it’ll be 51, but they can peep in if they want to see the diagram you have. But describe to us what you got. We’ll first share it and then describe to it.  Brendan Fortune:Alright, perfect. So I’ve got it shared here. Let’s zoom into our drip example. So it starts at the top with integrating customer data and anyone who’s used a marketing automation product, we’ll be familiar with this. So maybe you’re putting in an email address or the person’s name or their plan. If you’re a SaaS business, B2B SaaS, you put some sort of data in. And then with that data you craft messages that are personalized. So that could be personalized off a trigger really. A simple example is an onboarding campaign. So someone signs up that triggers a message to that person telling them, thanks for signing up and here’s some features you should try and et cetera. That’s at its most simplest. That’s stage two. Stage one, integrate customer data. Stage two send messages that’s personalized with this data. And then the last stage, stage three is you want to influence the recipient of that message. So you send the message out to them and there is a behavior that you’re hoping the recipient will take. So an onboarding campaign, maybe it’s that they log back in two days later, maybe a feature catches their eye and they’re like, oh, okay, that maybe that’s worth me reengaging with. Maybe it’s like a case study or a customer quote that they resonate with that’s going to push them back into your product and make it more likely that they’re going to convert. So that’s step three. And at that point you’ve completed the drip flywheel because you’re like, oh wow, I can put data in this system and set up this message automation once and it’s going to continuously impact the behavior of new customers as they sign up, which is great for my business. That’s amazing. So maybe I’ll put more data into Drip or I’ll use more of the data that I’ve already put in to send more and different kinds of messages that are going to influence more and different types of behavior. And for Drip and many marketing automation products, we price on profiles or people or contacts,  Rob Walling:Subscribers,  Brendan Fortune:Whatever subscribers. Yeah. See this is how I’ve been at customer for five years.  Rob Walling:We have five names for the same thing.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, exactly. And again, the more you put in, the more you pay. So there’s some sort of starting fee, but the expansion revenue comes in with companies like Drip and certainly customer. What this results in is enough companies are expanding their profile count enough companies are running around this flywheel successfully to offset the companies are not and end up churning. And that’s why you can sometimes have early cohorts of customers, I know customer IO does that are still paying the same amount of MRR as they were like 10 years ago, even though maybe like 20% of the companies have stayed with the product. So that’s kind of the power of attaching your pricing to this flywheel. If you have that pattern of customer behavior that you can identify that makes your customers successful and that you can fairly charge on. And that last part about fairly charge on is where the rubber meets the road and that’s where this can fall apart for some businesses, but most that I’ve gone through, you’ve been able to get something pretty good.  Rob Walling:If you want to invest in founders, you can do so through my world-class accelerator and venture fund TinySeed. We are currently raising our third fund after having raised and mostly deployed almost $42 million across our prior funds. If you’re an accredited investor or the equivalent in your country and you are interested in indexing across dozens if not hundreds of B2B SaaS companies that are handpicked by myself, a r and our team at TinySeed to be the companies that we believe will succeed, you can head to TinySeed dot com slash invest. If you enter your info there, it goes straight to a R. You’ve heard him on startups For the Rest Of Us, and you can have a conversation with him if you have any questions or you can receive our deck and our memo and just the thesis of what we’re investing under because we are a unique venture fund and SaaS accelerator. So if you think you might be interested in putting some capital to work in ambitious, mostly bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders, head to TinySeed dot com slash in. So I want to pop in here. The reason that drip charged per person contact subscriber, well, I’m going to say subscriber, that’s that’s what we called it when I left and then they renamed it when they went to e-comm. It’s person now or something. But the reason we did is because I saw the ESP market and I was like MailChimp and HubSpot and whoever else, Infusionsoft and everybody charged per contact or subscriber, that’s probably the way to do it. And I was aware of net negative churn and all that or of expansion revenue and negative churn, but I wasn’t fully aware about how powerful that would actually be. That’s why we did it. There was no more thought to it and it worked. Hey, I got a little lucky, I was smart a little bit and got a little lucky is really what happened. Could an argument be made based on what you’re saying here, which is it’s about customer data, not about, I mean you have this flywheel of integrate customer data, send the message and then influence the behavior. So should I have charged based on customer data, not number of subscribers? How do you know? Is it so clear from discussion that it should have been per person rather than what if a person, a subscriber has 50 data points, 50 attributes or a hundred attributes or a thousand? Can we describe charge on that? How do you think? Is that where fairly comes in?  Brendan Fortune:That’s where comes in, but actually it adds another dimension and that question’s kind of awesome because at least in marketing automation folks have tried it different ways. So we actually have some results of the impact of that. So Segment is one example. They started, and they’re a CDP, but they’ve added marketing automation to their suite. segment.com is a customer data platform. I’m again not sure if the whole audience is familiar with that, but it’s about aggregating all of your data in one place that you might want to send out to one or more marketing tools like Google Analytics or Drip. And they charge by API call because that’s what they do. They’re like, okay, well how many API calls?  Rob Walling:That’s how they started.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, exactly. And they were an engineer first company. And so they were like, yeah, a I calls they get that. And they went along for a while and I actually got to talk with one of the pricing folks who was involved in what I’m about to describe this pivot. And it was okay, but they weren’t growing that fast. So they started doing some pricing work and the insight they got out of it is a lot of the buyers of their product were marketers at this point who were like, oh yeah, my engineers are a pain to work with. They’d never want to work on my stuff. I want to get stuff into Drip or wherever else into Google Analytics, and they’re always kind of bothered by it. And so can you sell me this product that my engineers will like and they’ll integrate with once and then I can take it and connect it to the various different tools that I want. I don’t even have to bother engineering. And that message resonated. But then when they were asked, all right, great, yeah, totally. So how many API calls do you need? The blank stair comes and they have no idea it’s not, and then they lose the deal. So the insight was charged by person or they called it Monthly tracked user or MTU, because Google Analytics has that concept. Yeah, it’s not a good name, but it’s the one that Google Analytics has. And so they were like, well, that’s something that’s familiar to them. So that’s where some of the art over the science comes in where you want to figure out what is going to make sense to your buyer and then price based on  Rob Walling:That. Yeah. Okay. That’s super helpful.  Brendan Fortune:I can jump into theory a little bit more because oftentimes when I’m sharing this kind of concept, it’s like, well, okay, this sounds like it’s going to be interesting, but how am I going to apply this practically to my business? And there is a pretty straightforward method that I’ve seen work for several folks, which I can walk through.  Rob Walling:Yeah, let’s do it.  Brendan Fortune:So first thing you want to do is find your best customers, and maybe that’s your highest paying or your highest growing customers. And you can start with just one from that one customer. You want to ask yourself, what are the actions that they do in my every week? Or for some products it’s like every month marketing automation. It doesn’t always have as close of a login cycle, but what are the things that they’re doing over and over and over again? That’s the key. And once you’ve identified that, then you want to try and distill that into this pattern, the cyclical pattern of behavior. So going back to the simpler drip example, they put data in, they send a message off that data, that data actually influences behavior, and they can measure that. So whether it’s by a conversion or some other thing that’s measured in the product that says, yeah, someone clicked on this thing. And then that’s the movement that puts them back into the data part of the flywheel. So pick one of your highest paying customers, look at what they’re doing on a recurring basis and then figure out what the pattern of behavior is. Less than five steps, ideally just three, even if it means cutting some stuff out and cutting some corners. And the one requirement when you’re doing that is to make sure that each step naturally leads to the next. When you’re telling a story about it, it makes sense to you take some thinking. A lot of times I see people kind of come in and just jump straight to a flywheel and they’re like, yeah, they log into my page and then they search for a document and then they click to open the document or something. There’s some fairly simple pattern of behavior, and that’s where the last part of this flywheel exercise comes in, which is once you’ve identified this recurring pattern of behavior that you think represents how your customers get value out of your product, then you have to ask yourself, could I charge based on that behavior? And if it sounds totally insane, I mean Google Docs for example, like, oh, we’re going to charge you for every search that you run. Well, that seems kind of insane. Who’s going to accept that sort of pricing it? I don’t get value every single time that I can quantify off of that. That’s where you might need to pivot your flywheel a little bit and say, okay, well that behavior is not price worthy, so what else could I potentially try? And that’s where if you can get that nailed down, that’s where you can answer that question. Can I turn this into an expansion revenue engine? Which is really what the flywheel is meant to materialize for your business. And if you can do that, then all you got to do for your product strategy is be like, why aren’t people going between each step of this flywheel? Why aren’t they, oh, it’s because this is too hard. Okay, what are we going to prioritize making that easier? Great. And then that’s going to accelerate your flywheel, which is going to accelerate your expansion revenue and that’s going to grow your business.  Rob Walling:That’s the key. The two are linked. Yeah. Yeah. If they’re disparate, if they’re two different things, if you’re charging not for anything in the flywheel, then you now have to optimize the flywheel to get people onboarded and to improve retention. And then pricing is separate. And what you’re saying is if you can tie the two together, your job is so much easier.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, it’s so much easier. Then you have to not mess it up. But a lot of times it’s one of the problems with user-based pricing is you buy it, you’re one person, you’re always going to be one person. Maybe a company’s going to come in or your company’s going to grow and you’ll want to add more people to it, that’s fine, but it’s not tied to any pattern of behavior and you’re going to grow slower.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s interesting. When I talk to founders and I’m trying to help them with their pricing, sometimes it’s a first crack of like, well, we kind of got to go with our gut on this and let’s make it up a little bit. Or if they know something’s off, which is very common with new TinySeed batches, there’s usually like 60, 70% of the batch is like something’s off. We might either need to raise or our value metric is off or there’s something, or I have too many value metrics. There was someone with five value metrics and I was like, Nope, nope, nope. There’s no way you need all these. And he was like, oh, well this one’s for resellers. And I was like, then have a completely separate pricing page for resellers and move all that over there because you do not want all that cumbersome here. And I think we get from five down to either one or maybe two. And the second one was more of with an asterisk of within fair use, it was kind of really simplified. And I think, do we know it’s right? No. Do I think it’s better? I do. And now he gets to experiment with it and see over the next 3, 4, 5 months it feels right. And I think that’s a big deal. I used to say this was back in the hit tail days, 20 12, 20 13, so was that almost 13, 12, 13 years ago. I remember doing a talk and saying what I’m about to say is going to be so obvious, but it was not obvious, but no one was saying this. It was not obvious 13 years ago of you should be making more money, you should be charging more money, the more value your customer gets from your product. And it’s like, okay, that’s cool. And again, I say that today and it’s like, well, obviously it was like I’ve never heard that sentence ever. And then it’s like, okay, so what value do they get? What is the value? What is the value of an email service provider? Right? Email marketing like Drip, is it number of, because you and I consider and brainstorm and be like, well, it’s the dollar amount they make off of the emails they send maybe can you track that? This is where it comes back to, can I track that and can I charge based on that if I’m not doing the payment processing? Probably not. Probably can’t charge on that. And then it’s like, so is it the revenue? What if someone has an email list and they’re a blogger and they don’t sell anything really? They sell some courses maybe, but a lot of it is ad revenue, for instance. Well then that doesn’t make sense either. So then it’s like, well, is it number of emails sent? Well, maybe. And actually that’s what SendGrid does, right? But they’re more of an API. There’s something about, and I don’t know why the whole industry landed on people subscribers or whatever, but that does, the beauty of subscribers versus emails sent is I don’t know how much emails sent goes up every month, every month, every month for different accounts. But I do know that the ones that are succeeding, the customers that are succeeding, they do add subscribers every month. You know what I mean? Not every business can have the amazing, it’s good for the customer and it’s good for the business. It’s actually really hard. You can often find pricing that’s like, Ooh, this is optimal for the business and no customer is willing to pay it. That comes back to the, I think you said fairness, is it right?  Brendan Fortune:Yes.  Rob Walling:Or what’s so great? I have founders who come to me usually not TinySeed founders unless I’m telling ’em to change their pricing, but they’ll say, well, the reason that I’m a project management solution, all the other project management solutions charge based on either seats or projects or something like that. And the reason that people come to us is because unlimited all that stuff. And that’s why I have customers. So I can’t stop doing that. And I’m like, you are building a terrible business. You are not increasing. They’re getting more value and they’re not paying you. You’re going to cap at 5K MRR or 10 KMR. You’re never going to make it to seven or eight figures because it’s too in favor of the customer. Your pricing is too generous. So threading that needle as they say is harder than it sounds.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, it is. And that’s also when thinking about different businesses to start, this is an interesting exercise to play around with. There’s a session recording is an interesting one, like full Story or Log Rocket, and I think there are a couple startups starting there. One of the best things about that model is it’s usage based on sessions, and that makes a lot of sense to customers. For the most part. They’re willing to do it, so you’re going to be able to get some of that expansion revenue. Another interesting one, and I shared only in case it sparks something, Intercom has their AI powered chatbot and they’ve got an interesting pricing model for that, which is they charge based on successfully resolved chats as marked by the user. Okay, did we solve your problem? Yes. Which is interesting because that system feels like it could be kind of gamed, but it is something that can be measured and it’s something that the company itself isn’t selecting and perhaps it could influence. That’s on the spectrum of not fair at all to super fair. That’s on the super fair front. I actually am curious to see if they’re, see how it works, how their expansion revenue, it’s working. Yeah, it’s a fun story, but  Rob Walling:I saw a screenshot of a customer support tool, I think it might’ve been HelpScout Scout, which we use back in the day Drip. And they were moving their pricing from seat based, which they’ve been forever to number of tickets responded to or something like that. And that people were rage quit. And this was within the last few months, and I hope it’s Help Scout, I hope I’m not throwing ’em under the bus, but it was one of those kind of startupy ones that has become much more prominent. And I was like, oh, I wouldn’t, no, that’s too far. That is not fair anymore to me. Unless you, now if you start that way and everybody knows that going in maybe, but to change now from seed after having to begin seed base for 15 years to suddenly that it’s like, oh, that’s a real, that’s tough.  Brendan Fortune:It’s a hard sell, especially if you are raising your prices by doing that. And that’s the one way I could see it potentially working. If you’re like, Hey, we’ve got this a new model and it’s actually going to save you money, then you just hope that you’re not again, screwing your business because that is then a heavy risk Mix panel for anyone who uses that. They may have experienced their kind of pricing back and forth, which is just unusual. I haven’t seen that very much. But they started charging by events and then they were like, you know what? That’s not fair. We’re going to charge by Mtus segment or by people, unique people, and then we’ll put a very generous cap on the number of events you can log against a person. And they did that for two years and then the founder updated or the CEO was like, Hey, just kidding. We’re going to go back to event-based stuff. And the short version is because they had to make more money than they were able to make off empty use. So it’s a risky thing, but also, I mean, like you were saying at the beginning, if you can get the pricing and packaging, I dunno, sometimes it’s like 80 or 90% of the money challenge. And even as you’re constructing the business just thinking about, am I actually going to be able to charge for this thing? That’s almost all that matters at the end of the day, if it’s a business that you’re creating.  Rob Walling:Brandon Fortune, thanks so much for joining me on the show. If folks want to keep up with you or get in touch with you, they can hit you up on LinkedIn. You are Brendan Fortune and you were telling me offline if people have thoughts, comments, if they think fly pricing and Flywheel is bs, right, or if they think it’s great or have questions, they can reach out to you.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. I love to discuss it and there’s always room to improve some of the process of pulling this thing together.  Rob Walling:All right, thanks again for joining me man.  Brendan Fortune:Alright, thank you.  Rob Walling:Thanks so much to Brendan for coming on the show. He shared a link to his Miro template and an image. We’ll be in the show notes. It’s all the stuff we were kind of talking about during the episode. He was very generous with his time. In addition, a reminder that if you have any type of product questions, product management, deciding what to build, when to build, how to market it, how to communicate it to your team, just anything around product management. Brendan is an expert and if we get enough questions, I will have him back on the show To answer those, you can send ’em to questions at startups For the Rest Of Us dot com or head to startups For the Rest Of Us dot com. Click ask a question in the top nav and of course put product question in the subject and I’ll get ’em back on the show. Thank you for listening this week and every week. This is Rob Walling signing off from episode 756. Hello, dear listener, you found the hidden track on startups For the Rest Of Us, episode 750, something in this track. I’m going to ask Brendan Fortune five trivia questions about Fifth Edition, DUNS and Dragons for those in case I didn’t already say it in the episode. Brendan has played in my DD game with Derek Rimer, who listeners of the show know as well as a couple other founders here in the Minneapolis area and Brendan knows the rules pretty good. You know why  Brendan Fortune:I know the rules pretty  Rob Walling:Good. Don’t say it. Why do you know the rules? Pretty good. Balder’s Gate three. Balder’s Gate three. So whenever Brendan references Balders Gate three at my table, I force him to drink something. And it’s not always alcoholic because we need to be responsible kids. But BG three, it touched the rules. It did. It’s a good game. Yeah, it is. Actually. I’ve seen it. I’ve never played it. Alright, so let’s dive in. We’re going to go from easiest to hardest and obviously if you’ve never played Fifth Edition, DED, you don’t give a crap about it. Just skip to the next podcast. This is just fun people we’re chilling. The first question, what ability score is used for range attack  Brendan Fortune:Roles? Dexterity all day?  Rob Walling:Yes. Final answer.  Brendan Fortune:Final answer. Do you need to phone a friend? Not yet. Although I have Chet GPT up. I’m going to try not to. Don’t dare it, Don. Don’t you dare  Rob Walling:Use it. It’ll make me sound so  Brendan Fortune:Smart. Alright, fine.  Rob Walling:You got one out of one so far. Ding ding. Yes. Second question. Getting slightly harder. What saving throw is required to resist the fireball spell constitution? Incorrect. It is dexterity. It was a trick because the first and the second answers were the same.  Brendan Fortune:Boo  Rob Walling:Fireball,  Brendan Fortune:Correct? Not representing three. Well,  Rob Walling:The best you can do now is 80%. B minus. Nice. Next question. Getting slightly harder. What is the maximum level a character can reach in a single class?  Brendan Fortune:I should know this, but we’re so far away. I’m going to say I’m watching your face. 1220. The answer is  Rob Walling:20. Yes, that’s what I said. Got it. 67% right. Now you have a D plus, which I’m sure was your GPA and I got to be Derek though in high school. What did he get? I don’t remember. Actually we need to look back at that episode. The fourth question. How far can a character typically jump with a strength score of 15 long jumps?  Brendan Fortune:15 feet? That is correct. Oh wow. Okay. This is, I’ve never jumped in our game.  Rob Walling:Not once. GBTA character can long jump 15 feet equal to their strength score. If they have a 10 foot running start,  Brendan Fortune:Look at that.  Rob Walling:Okay, the fifth and final question. Oh, this is brutal. This is really detailed. How many spell slots does a fifth level wizard have for third level spells? I think just one. Two. Yeah, one. So here’s the thing, I’m not going to hold you to this one because that’s just not fair. It’s two. But why would you Who memorizes that? No. So how about this is your fifth, which condition prevents a creature from taking actions or reactions?  Brendan Fortune:Incapacitated.  Rob Walling:So here’s the thing  Brendan Fortune:And paralyzed, but that’s incapacitated.  Rob Walling:I think you’re right is in, because the answer that GPT has is stunned, but I think paralyzed but I think wouldn’t paralyzed do the same thing. I’m going to give that to you.  Brendan Fortune:Okay,  Rob Walling:Good. I think there are multiple answers is my gut.  Brendan Fortune:Yeah, because a lot of things could cause stunning  Rob Walling:As everyone know. Well, stunned is also a condition, but as everyone knows who plays at my table, I’m the dungeon master and I barely know the rules of dungeons and  Brendan Fortune:Dragons.

Before we dive into the episode, if you want to invest in founders like Colleen, you can do so through my world class accelerator and Venture fund TinySeed. We are currently raising our third fund after having raised and mostly deployed almost $42 million across our prior funds. If you’re an accredited investor or the equivalent in your country and you are interested in indexing across dozens, if not hundreds of B2B SaaS companies that are handpicked by myself, a r, and our team at TinySeed to be the companies that we believe will succeed. You can head to TinySeed dot com slash invest. If you enter your info there, it goes straight to a R. You’ve heard him on startups For the Rest Of Us, and you can have a conversation with him if you have any questions or you can receive our deck and our memo and just the thesis of what we’re investing under because we are a unique venture fund and SaaS accelerator. So if you think you might be interested in putting some capital to work in ambitious, mostly bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders, head to TinySeed dot com slash invest. Let’s dive into the episode.  Colleen Schnettler:I’m just naturally energetic and enthusiastic and optimistic, right? I was projecting my, oh my gosh, you love this, and they were like, yeah, I guess so.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the wild rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today in episode four, we’re back with Colleen Schneller, a developer, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Hello Query, and Colleen’s been busy when we last spoke. She had recently almost broken up with her business partner, completely pivoted her company and changed its name, and through all this unrest, she’s been using customer interviews as a guiding light.  Colleen Schnettler:What’s interesting is you hear so much about how important it’s to do customer interviews, but if those are not focused, then it can be hard for those interviews to lead you in the right direction. This is probably our third round, and I’ve probably talked to 20 people since I spoke with you last. As we refine our vision for what this product should be, what we learned was there’s even higher value for our customers customers to get their data. Our customers customers need to build their own reports. These companies are constantly being asked for custom reports from their customers, and so that to us means embedding in your application.  Rob Walling:And so this is a change from last time we spoke because we had talked about Hello Query, great name by the way, being a standalone SaaS app that would almost be used by internal teams. But now you’re saying after these interviews, it sounds like you’ve gotten a signal that says, no, we need to embed in other apps. So as an example, if I had an email service provider and I’m a SaaS app and I have a thousand customers and I need them to be able to develop customer reports, you’re saying I would be able to embed Hello Query in my SaaS apps. Is that right?  Colleen Schnettler:Exactly. So if you’re an email service provider, maybe your customers want to segment their email list. This is a very common thing, and so you wouldn’t have to build that out. You can drop in a Hello Query, embed, set up some custom base queries for tenancy concerns, and they can then build out and save and segment their own customer lists.  Rob Walling:Got it. And when you do interviews like this or you have customer conversations, it’s often very noisy. It’s often not nearly as clear as folks make it out to be. I remember I did a talk seven, eight years ago as we were building Drip, and I was trying to figure out what we actually were building in for who it was early, it was trying to figure out product-market fit, and I had a hundred emails sent into me from people who were canceling, and then I had a bunch of conversations and I remember saying, this was our conclusion, and boy does it seem obvious and brilliant in retrospect, but I had very little confidence. I mean, I was like a 40% out of a hundred of maybe this is the right thing. Question. Do you feel similar to how I’ve just described or do you feel like you have a higher level of certainty than that?  Colleen Schnettler:That’s a tough question. I feel like this is 50% confidence, 50% gut, because literally from the beginning, Rob, this is what I have wanted to build, and what was happening when we get on these customer calls is when we asked them about internal reporting and we say, how many times does your C-Suite, for example, request a report maybe once a week? Once a week is not that painful. And then if you move up market, the upmarket companies are using a Power bi. They want all of those additional features that we don’t plan to add. So it feels like a bit of a gut decision, but also it was almost like we’ve always wanted to build this and we now have talked to 20 plus people that confirm that we are probably on the correct path.  Rob Walling:In our previous episode, Colleen mentioned a red flag. Her original idea didn’t have any competition. It’s one of the main reasons she made such a big pivot. So I wanted to know this new idea, does it have competitors? Have other companies already tried this idea? And if so, what is Hello Query going to do differently?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, there are definitely competitors in the space. Even on these customer calls, I saw at least two people show me a different embedded solution to solve this exact problem. So we know it exists and we found this with the first iteration of our product giving someone else a different company control over that. People do not like that. That is generally not what we are trying to do. So the companies that seem really excited about this are companies that are data heavy companies. Visual interfaces aren’t what they’re looking for. Their users want to get their data out. Their customers have their own data analysts. So data analysts don’t want the SaaS owner to build charts for them. Data analysts want their hands on their data, and so these are the kind of companies we’re going to target.  Rob Walling:And so given that reporting is usually, I will say, not that it’s not important, but I remember that being a big pain in my ass. So it’s like reports are almost a necessary evil have been in my experience. And so I think that’s what you’re saying is that’s why it’s not a core feature in essence, it’s a core feature because customers want it, but it’s not something that as a product team I typically want to be building.  Colleen Schnettler:Exactly. Those are the kinds of people we’ve been talking to is my customers want their data out, they want it in Excel, they’re going to put it in a Power BI or they like Excel where they live and building out reporting and filtering and custom export CSVs and scheduling is not core to our product. We don’t really care, but we’ve got to give them this feature, and by the way, we can upcharge them for this feature, and I love that because now we’re closer to the money.  Rob Walling:Absolutely. Yeah. I believe we talked either offline or maybe on this podcast about some issues you were running into when this was still an embeddable component, but then it’s like, well, I got to tweak the styles. It has to match the app because they have customers using it. How do you get around that with this?  Colleen Schnettler:So here’s what we’ve decided. Right or wrong, we’ve decided that this is what it looks like full. So this last round of interviews have been, they’re not quite sales yet because I’m still trying to fully wrap my hands around people’s problems, but I also show them what we have and it looks very nice. I mean, it looks great, and again, I think for us, we can’t just target everyone in the world. We’re a small team of two. We are going to niche down really, really tight.  Rob Walling:That’s a nice attitude to have for a V one,  Colleen Schnettler:I hope so,  Rob Walling:To know what, to know what you can say yes and no to, because that is often the hardest thing to know is what do we build into this first version? It needs to be not very buggy and it needs to look pretty good. And so folks who need it desperately haven’t had an issue then with the fact that it may not, the fonts and the spacing and the whatever else may not exactly match our UX paradigm.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, no one has had an issue with that yet.  Rob Walling:These customer interviews are key for Hello Query’s future. I asked Colleen for some insight into how she’s preparing for these conversations and if her approach is changing over time.  Colleen Schnettler:I am naturally a pretty social person, so I just thought I would be magically good at customer interviews and no, I’m really not magically good at them. You have to go in with understanding your own personality and understanding how to get people to be honest with you and kind of walk that line. When I first started doing them, I heard everyone say yes because I’m just naturally energetic and enthusiastic and optimistic. I was projecting my, oh my gosh, you love this, and they were like, yeah, I guess so. And after doing so many of these, I think I have hit a really nice balance of really being who I am, still being myself, but also not pushing them in a specific direction. When I get on a call with someone and I say, how are you solving this problem now if they haven’t even tried to solve it, it’s not a big problem. I’ve done so many of these. I know what questions to ask, and I can tell pretty quickly by the size of your business, how frequently you have this problem, what you are already paying to solve this problem. So I think that’s just something you learn the more you do it.  Rob Walling:I think a question a lot of folks listening will have is, how did you find these 20 people?  Colleen Schnettler:So right now, our social networks are still our number one source of traffic. So some of these people came in through cold LinkedIn outreach, but I did a whole LinkedIn outreach cold outreach campaign, and it was great because I learned a lot and I actually got a decent number of responses, which was very exciting. I had a much better success rate with people coming in from Twitter because it’s kind of like a warm intro based on all of these calls and people have reached out. I’ve got a group of what I’m calling founding customers, three to four people depending, and the plan is to give them the V one, see if it solves their problem, work with them, iterate until we can narrow the funnel on who really is our target customer. I think long-term cold outreach is going to be one of our traction channels, but again, I can’t outreach to people if I don’t know who those people are.  Rob Walling:I like what you’ve said. It’s something that I think a lot of folks missed. It’s not just what are we building? Who are we building this for? You have to answer those two questions. And oftentimes you can have an amazing product idea like you do now, but if you don’t know who it is you’re focused on and who you’re selling to, it becomes a real problem once you get through your first three or four customers who actually come in. So I just want to call that out for who maybe discount that.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, the customer thing is really hard.  Rob Walling:While these customer calls have been crucial for Colleen, it’s not the only thing she’s been busy with. So I’m curious, you have this validation of where you want to head in the next, what month or two, how much progress have you made technically in terms of implementing features.  Colleen Schnettler:We have a working secure embeddable link that shows what your users will see if I were to embed this in my application and they were able to use it. And so it’s been really fun because I have been able to play around with it and see how useful it is and what kind of things do I want to do that I can’t do and what’s important to me. And so it feels like we’ve made a ton of progress on product.  Rob Walling:I’m surprised that it’s gone that quickly. Is it because you already had a core from the hammer stone days or refine days that you were able to repurpose?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes. So we had a large part of the code already exists because we are using our old product in the new product.  Rob Walling:Nice little shortcut. Well, it’s handy to be able to not just throw away all that,  Colleen Schnettler:Isn’t  Rob Walling:It? Yeah, no kidding. That’s nice. This is where it is a pivot. Sometimes people will say, I was going to build project management for hair salons and now I’m going to pivot into building in a mobile app on Facebook. And it’s like, that’s not a pivot. That’s just a completely different thing.  Colleen Schnettler:Absolutely. And I think that data is just such a good place to be. So I have been spending a lot of time in the big data analysts, Tableau, power BI forums, hanging out, seeing what those people are doing, and everyone needs data. Our world is controlled by data, so people are going to want to access their data. I think it really is interesting too. Some people just want to throw their Excel files into chat GPT, and we can enable that. It’s literally at its very, very core, all of this packaging and positioning, we’re still solving the same problem. And the fundamental problem we’re solving is you want your data out of your database so you can actually understand it, play with it, build visualizations, whatever you’re into. And so yeah, it does feel like a true pivot as opposed to it. Let’s scrap all of this. We’ve been working on it for two years and just start from zero.  Rob Walling:I’m curious, what are you most looking forward to and what is the thing that will keep you up at night?  Colleen Schnettler:I am most looking forward to getting this into customer’s hands because these interviews, Rob, I mean, we are in this position now where it feels like momentum. It feels like it’s going to work. And you know what else is really tricky about this is finding the right balance. To your point, this isn’t an MVP. These people are going to put this in their production software, so we have to be really, really careful when we look at the quality versus minimal features to value figuring that out. And so that’s why on one hand, I’m super excited to get in front of people, but I’m also very nervous that if we do it too early, we will erode trust and lose those potential customers.  Rob Walling:If I was in Colleen shoes, I’d feel that exact same mix of excitement and nerves, but with the insights from her customer interviews, I have a good feeling she’s on the ride path. We’ll check back in with her in a month or two. By then, she’ll have had some time to get her product into customer’s hands and she can share some insights into this key moment.","PublishedAt":"February 6, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-755-tinyseed-tales-s4e4-customer-interviews-pivoting"},{"Title":"Episode 754 | Broken Freemium, SaaS Plateaus, and More Listener Questions (A Rob Solo Adventure)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 754 | Broken Freemium, SaaS Plateaus, and More Listener Questions (A Rob Solo Adventure)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25:05\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 25:05 | Recorded on February 4, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 754, join Rob Walling for a solo adventure as he tackles listener questions on a variety of topics.

I’m Rob Walling, and this is the podcast for folks who want to build real software businesses, real SaaS companies that sell a real product to real customers for real money, you can be bootstrapped, you can be mostly bootstrapped. Frankly, you can raise a cajillion dollars in venture capital, and I still believe that the content and the thoughts and the ideas and the strategies and the inspiration and the tactics that I present here on this show are applicable to you no matter which of those buckets you fall in. Unless you’re planning to have kid rock at your launch party and you want to stay pre-revenue forever because your valuation is more important to you than actually making money, then this podcast is not for you. But if you want to build real SaaS companies, real software companies, then this podcast is laser focused designed for you. Today I’m going to be answering listener questions. It’s been a minute since I’ve taken some listener questions on, and if you have a question for the show, you can email it to questions at startups For the Rest Of Us dot com or head to startups For the Rest Of Us dot com. Go to ask a question in the top nav. As always, video questions go to the top of the stack, although I have been taking text questions that are more intermediate or later stage because I’ve found that the pipeline gets pretty clogged with how do I choose an idea and I’m, what should I do and how do I launch? That’s all interesting, but I think answering question after question after question for pre-revenue folks gives an indication that is not true that this podcast is aimed at beginners, which it is not. So send your intermediate to advance to later stage questions as well as your beginner questions. We’ll tackle those in upcoming episodes. But before I dive into listener questions, I want to let you know that MicroConf Connect applications are open today through February 5th to create the best possible experience. We welcome new members in monthly cohorts with applications open for just 72 hours each month. Microcom Connect is our online community. It is the best online community of bootstrapped SaaS founders. Every month we put on a special live call with a new guest, and if you remember this month, you get access to a live call with Harry Lawson where he’s going to break down SaaS copywriting Essentials. Harry has written for companies like Testimonial two Sewell and ve.io, and next month I believe I am the special guest on the live call where I will do live q and a. It’s always a blast. If you’re interested in becoming part of this worldwide year-round online community of MicroConf Connect, head to MicroConf connect.com to apply. Applications are only open until February 5th. If you miss this window, you will have to wait until march MicroConf connect.com. So with that, let’s dive into my first question from Edan Maas. This question came to me on X Twitter where I asked about some more intermediate stage questions, and this one’s on the edge, but Idon asks, what do you do if there are many free signups but not many paid conversions, and you have already tried removing the free plan? I’m not sure I fully understand what this question, if you’ve removed the free plan, then you shouldn’t have any more free signups. Or I guess you’re saying you have free users that you haven’t kicked out of the free plan. You’ve only removed the free plan for new people. So I’m a little confused by this. I think I’m going to answer it multiple ways. I’ll start with the idea that freemium, which is of course different than a free trial freemium is often what I call forever free, where you’re only limited by the number of actions that you take, say signing a document or sending emails, or maybe it’s having a certain amount of subscribers and you’re capped. And if you go over that number, then it’s not free anymore, but it’s not a time-based free trial. So freemium should have not many paid conversions. That’s kind of how it works. Dropbox brags or bragged back in the day about we get all these signups and 3% convert to paid after a year. So I would call that not many paid conversions for a year. A year, you get 3%. This is why freemium, it’s not a never for bootstrappers. It’s a by default. Don’t do it. What do you do if there are many free signups, not many paid conversions. Don’t do freemium. Listen to this podcast and in general, don’t do freemium. Now, are there bootstrap, mostly bootstrap founders who are making freemium work? There are a few, right? Ruben Gomez is the famous example. When he comes on the show, we talk about Sewell and how he has made freemium work. There are tens of others that I couldn’t even name ’em all. There are very, very few. I’m not saying it doesn’t work. I’m saying in general, it is way harder to get it to work than you think. It’s so if you are in doubt, don’t try freemium just you can have a free trial. You don’t need to ask for credit card upfront. You need to find out if you build something people want and are willing to pay for. If you have removed the free plan for new signups and you still have a bunch of people hanging out in a free plan that are not converting, you can end your free plan for current users. They’re not customers because they’re not paying you anything but free users. And I have done this myself with a product I acquired 15 years ago, and several TinySeed companies have done this, and I say TinySeed companies because I have pretty detailed insight into what they’re doing and how they’re doing it and the results of it. And any of them that remove their free plan, even for existing users, have never gone back. I didn’t go back either. So usually that’s what I would do is I’d reach out to, if there are power users that are on the free plan, I’d reach out to them directly. I remember when I removed the free plan, there were a few people that had really helped promote the app over the years, and one of them was like a college professor, for example, a university professor and asked if he could get a discount or a comp, and I just comped him because he had recommended it to a bunch of people. And you can make exceptions here, but the idea that you have 500 or 5,000 free users and almost none of them are converting implies that either your yardstick is in the wrong place, meaning you’re giving away too much in your free plan. So people never need to convert. So you might need to think about moving that or you just kill the free plan altogether and build a more traditional bootstrap, mostly bootstrap business with a free trial where people have a time constraint to convert, and if you create enough value for them, then they pay you. There are a lot of levers to pull with freemium, and it is one of those, I think it’s harder to make a broad generalization of like, well, here’s how I would design a free plan, right? I can tell you basically with SaaS pricing, some rules of thumb that I have about each one doubles in price, but you give away more in the value metric. There’s all this stuff. I’ve given talks about this. I’ve talked about this on this podcast, but freemium is to me much more a one since it’s so complicated. It’s much more kind of a one-off really understanding your customers and really understanding where that line is, where you’re giving away enough in the free plan to get them to use it, but not so much that they never upgrade. Now, if you are talking about, when you say free signups, if you’re talking about free trial signups, but not many paid conversions, that’s a question about the funnel. It’s like, well, is anyone getting onboarded? What does onboarded even mean? Is there 1, 2, 3 steps that people need to take in order to get value from the product? Are they doing that well? If not, you need to reach out to them via email, via in-app message, potentially. If they’re paying you enough or going to pay you enough, you reach out manually. You hire a customer success person who basically is in charge of that because if people don’t get onboarded, then there will be no paid conversions beyond that, even if people do get onboarded, if you still aren’t solving a desperate aspirin pain point for them, the odds of them converting are low. And so there’s a bunch of questions to ask throughout your funnel. There’s no one thing of like, oh, you just flip this switch. Obviously you just put a credit card up front and that fixes everything. It’s not like that, right? Funnels are always about which step are the most people dropping off and why? And the first one you can answer with analytics, and the second one you answer usually with conversations, why are they dropping off? That’s often the hard part because you can look at as many screen recordings as you want. You can look at as many heap or mixedpanel dashboards as you want, but you will not know why they’re dropping off till you talk to your customers and potential customers. So thanks for that question. I hope it was helpful. My next question comes from a BOMA and ab BOMA asks, with the exponential advancements in ai, how do you think the world of building SaaS products will be affected, if at all in the next few years? It will. And this question was asked what? Six, seven months ago? You can tell the backlog of questions. We have an our role said, and I recorded an entire episode dedicated to AI and how to think about it in terms of your SaaS. The episode is 663 from May of 2023. It’s five insights SaaS founders should know about ai ignore at your peril. That is still as valid today as it was of the day we recorded it. Although AI has changed. We talk in that episode about why you shouldn’t ignore it. The four categories. I put categories to these because you know them. I’m a framework thinker, right? There was sorting in categorization, there was generative ai, of course, that generates things, images, texts, and others, and a couple others. We talk about how AI is not actually a product differentiator. Should bootstrap companies try to build their own LLMs using AI internally in your company? Talked about business models, whether they’re ticking time bombs. So that is as valid today as it was a year and a half ago when we recorded it. There are a few changes to answer AB BMO’s question number one, obviously many SaaS companies will integrate it as features into their product. So if there’s any point where your customers need to create some type of content, whether what is it a blog post or a social media post of any kind, obviously AI can help them generate that or improve that. This is obvious, but that’s one place where it’s going to be applied. Second place that you should be thinking about applying is in your own internal operations. So here at MicroConf and TinySeed, although we are not SaaS company, we are certainly serving a lot of customers, a lot of prospects, a big audience. We are creating content. We’re doing a lot of things that you would do at a SaaS company, marketing, even some sales, all that kind of stuff. And so we use AI pretty extensively, whether it’s Gemini or Claude or Chat GPT to help us get there faster. We don’t publish AI generated content per se. I just don’t believe the quality is there. But if you’re not using AI to help make you more effective and efficient with your internal operations, your marketing or sales, you will fall behind. And then the third broad place where I really think AI is impacting things, especially with building SaaS products, is how much faster and more productive it makes developers and whether using cursor, copilot any of the other tools of the day that Devon, I think was popular, seemed for like two weeks. No one’s talking about Devon anymore, but you get the point. It’s not the tool. It’s the idea that it can make developers move quicker and be more efficient. And what I’ve noticed is I haven’t seen anyone, at least in the SaaS space, fire people or lay them off because, oh, we’re suddenly so much more efficient. I’ve just seen them faster. That’s the thing, it’s an accelerant, not a differentiator. Someone said this, who was it? Maybe it was Patrick Campbell, might be misattributing that, but think of AI as an accelerant. It gets you there faster. If you don’t use it, you’ll be slower than your competition. It doesn’t differentiate you because your competition can and will use it. But if I were a software developer today, as much of a pain in the butt as it would be to integrate AI into my workflow, I would 100% be considering it. I think it’s going to make all of us, it’s like a mech suit. It makes all of us a little better, a little stronger, a little faster, a little more effective. If you can get over kind of the learning curve, get over that hump of integrating into your workflow because it is, I know that if you’re used to writing all the code yourself, suddenly you’re using ai. It’s a little cumbersome at first, but I think it will allow us to build more SaaS products faster and build features faster and make every developer that you have more effective. Now, what that means is the pace of development and of feature development and the pace of competition will also accelerate. So do I think AI is going to have impact on SaaS products? Yeah, I think it already has, and I think it will continue to. And really the question, because Boma asked over the next few years, and it kind of depends on is AI going to continue the pace of innovation that it has because it has seemed to plateau recently. I know that they’re trying to get, is it chat GPT five oh or 4.5 or something? And their reports, rumor reports are that they’re really struggling to make it that much better. Don’t get me wrong, it’s good. I use chat GPT almost every day, almost every working day, and I know a lot of my team does as well. It’s just getting integrated into all our workflows. But if AI has plateaued for the time being, then that’s one outcome. We’re going to see what we see and we get what we get, and that’s where the pace of innovation stops over the next few years. If it continues to exponentially or starts to exponentially appreciate in value, then I can imagine the impact on all of us is going to be a lot more significant. So what I’m saying is that part of this relies on how fast the underlying AI models advance over the next few years. So thanks to that question, OMA. I hope it was helpful. My next question is from Eddie Vink. And Eddie asks, not my product, but notion is launching Notion sites. So this again, is seven months ago. Do you think this is a threat for Notion site builder products, or is it an opportunity? 100%. It’s a threat. Anytime a big player, this is platform risk. Anytime a big player launches a feature that a bunch of step one business builders have built following the stair-step method, it’s detrimental. Inevitably, even if they build kind of a version of it that is feature limited that doesn’t do anywhere near, I have a thing, but my thing is better, my thing has five times the number of features or my thing is way easier to use or look, it does all this other stuff for you. What happens is a bunch of notion people who don’t want to add another product to their chain, they don’t want to add another integration. They don’t want to add another 20, 30, $40 subscription. They just put up with it. And if it’s good enough, it will absolutely negatively impact notion site builder products. Now, are there a specialized tool? If you’re a super specific notion site builder for some vertical niche and you are truly not competing with notion sites that, I’m trying to think of an example. You’re for a tight vertical, you’re for notion for gyms or martial arts dojos or notion sites for software teams doing agile development, assuming that the notion sites, capital N, capital S, the product that they put out isn’t able to do the things and you are positioned correctly of like, Hey, thinking of using notes and sites, well, it doesn’t work for X, Y, Z, and we do, then do I think you’ll still be okay? Yeah, probably. But I do think that in general, platform risk is tough, and I’ve faced it myself and relying on, well, multiple platforms over the years, especially Google was always one that really hit me hard. And this isn’t a reason not to build step one businesses or businesses that are in these app marketplaces. These are great little businesses that can I say little, I mean, some of them, you can get to five KA month, some of you can get to 40, 50 KA month. These can be great. They can be life-changing. But would I build and would I stake my, let’s say my family’s financial wellbeing on something with a lot of platform risk? I would not expect my app to exist 10 years from now if I was heavily, heavily reliant and built on a platform. And I recorded a podcast episode just three or four months ago back in October. It’s episode 7 35, the eight levels of SaaS Platform Risk. And if you are wondering why platform risk is not just binary like a lot of people think, but that there are actually many, many levels and there are three different elements of platform risk and then eight different levels. You got to go listen to the episode to hear it. It was my favorite episode I recorded last year. That episode will 100% categorize this thought around notion launching their own version of sites. So is it a death noll for all third party notion site builder products? No. Will it negatively impact a lot of them? Potentially Most of them, yeah, I do think so, unfortunately. So thanks for that question, Eddie. Hope it was helpful. My next question also from x Twitter is from Tom McGee. Tom asks my app, there’s a lot of things and an unexpected auxiliary vertical that’s fundamentally different from our primary. One is getting a lot more attention than I expected. Should I put it behind a paywall to upsell, spin it out into its own thing? These are questions. I’m reading them without question marks, but spin it out into its own thing. The problem with including it as an upgrade is some users only want it, so it would have no use for the base product. Got it. So you have a base product, you have kind of an add-on and somehow a single vertical wants just that. This is, of course, I would really like more specifics, but realistically, spin it out into its own thing. Probably not. Usually the default for me is don’t do that. You need a new website, you need a new domain name, you need a new Stripe account, you need to do marketing and support, and you need email addresses and you need to do SEO and you need to do outbound and a support inbox. And it’s just people think that spinning something out into its own thing is, well, the code, it’s easy to spin the code, just fork the code and it’s, or even I just point to the same repo. And that is, I dunno, maybe 10% of the effort, it’s 20% of the effort. It’s all the other spinning something out into its own thing is just don’t underestimate how it’s launching a second product. So my answer is, unless I saw a really, really strong reason, and without all the details, it’s hard for me to know if there’s a strong reason, but unless I saw a very strong reason to do so, I would put it behind a paywall. And you can either make it a different tier of the product. I mean, you could have two products on your website, so it’s the same domain, but then there’s a dropdown and there’s X, Y, Z product for this vertical and X, Y, Z product for this other vertical or X, Y, Z product for everyone. And then if you’re specifically in this education vertical or whatever vertical it is, you can do that. Again, it’s hard for me to make specific recommendations without knowing the specifics, but would I put it behind a paywall to upsell? I would, if there’s a bunch of interest now there’s a conversation to be had around, ooh, is it viral? Is it driving new leads? Should it be freemium instead? And again, without info, it’s hard to talk that through. But in general, if I get a bunch of interest, I would look to keep it on the same website with all the same infrastructure I have and kind of inch my way out there to see if there’s enough interest that people will actually pay for it. So thanks for that question, Tom. Hope it was helpful. And my last question of the day also from X Twitter comes from Tony Meer. Tony asks, at certain sizes of the company, it seems to stop growing. What are these ranges and how do you break through to the next range? So I appreciate the question, Tony, but I do not accept the premise that at certain sizes of companies, they seem to stop growing. That’s not true. It’s not about company size. What it’s about is the famous formula for plateaus. And that formula is new MRR divided by monthly revenue churn as a percent. So if you are adding $3,000 of new MRR each month and your monthly revenue churn is 5%, that’s 0.05. You will plateau at $60,000 of MRR. And if you cut your churn in half, they’re still adding $3,000 of MRR each month and your churn is only two and a half percent. You will plateau at $120,000 of MRR. That’s it. So realize that how much MRR you’re adding in a given month is affected by your pricing. So pricing has a big impact on this. Your A CV or your average revenue per account per month. Churn is a huge part of this, right? So that’s how many people are canceling based on your existing customer base. And so I see companies plateauing at every stage. And frankly, I did a talk at MicroConf Europe about breaking through the seven SaaS growth plateaus, and I identified seven reasons that companies had plateaued. And I went into TinySeed and actually specifically I have all their revenue graphs, right? 192 companies. And then I specifically reached out and said, oh, you plateaued here. What happened? And so one of the causes, for example, is not enough leads and one of ’em is having a leaky funnel, and the third one is having high churn. Fourth is competition. Fifth is you’ve tapped out your market. It’s just not that big of a market. So the reasons behind why folks plateau are one thing, but the ranges, I mean, I see folks plateau at one KMRR, I see them plateau at 5K, 10 K, 15 K, 20 K 25 30, 35, I mean all the way up. And then I see people plateau at one or 2 million. There is no certain size of a company where they plateau. The tough part is once you plateau, getting past it is really, really tough. That was actually the kind of sad news as I look through all these graphs is that if you don’t plateau, then you keep going. You have momentum. The moment you plateau, the odds of you getting past that plateau are actually quite low, at least from the analysis that I did. So that’s why you want to always be looking ahead and when things are working, not resting on your laurels because you want to try not to plateau because getting past them and building that momentum from scratch is not quite the cold start problem. But it’s just hard. It’s hard. And it often requires a big strategic shift of like, well, I need to expand into another vertical, or we need to double our pricing, or we need an entirely new lead source because everything we’ve done just isn’t, it isn’t getting us there. Or we need to serve an entirely new user base because our churn is just pegged at five or 6%. And although we’ve tried a ton of stuff, nothing has reduced that. And so we are just plateauing at this mark. So what’s interesting is the answer to how do you break through to the next range? There isn’t a range, but how do you break through a plateau is you identify the problem and you fix it, right? So if you don’t have enough leads coming in each month, meaning you’re not adding enough MRR, then you add more leads, well then the question is, well, how do I do that? And that’s a whole other thing than we could write books on that. Or if it’s you have a leaky funnel, meaning your conversion rates are low in your trial to paid or whatever, then you look at that and you optimize that. The how do you breakthrough is actually kind of trivial. It’s trivial to know what to do. It’s often hard to know exactly how to do it. And that is why I gave that talk. That is not, I don’t believe it’s up on YouTube and I might actually be giving it in New Orleans. I haven’t decided yet. Kind of want to add a little bit to it if I’m going to do that. But that’s why I did that talk is because plateaus are pretty scary and I’ve never seen an analysis of them that tried to look at the causes, the effects, and potentially how to think about getting around them. So thanks for your question, Tony. I hope that was helpful. Thanks for hanging out with me today, this week and every week. It’s so great to be in your earbuds. I haven’t answered listener questions in quite a while, especially not a solo episode. So this felt good. I think I’m going to do another couple here in the next few episodes.

This is where we continue hearing Colleen SCH nestler’s startup journey. Before we dive into the episode, I want to tell you about the SaaS Institute. It’s at SaaS institute.com and it’s our private and premium coaching offering that is going to be launching here in the next month or two. The SaaS Institute is a private coaching community designed for B2B SaaS founders doing at least a million in a RR. We’re going to keep the initial cohort very small and invitations will be going out soon. Head to SaaS institute.com and enter your email address if you’re interested. And now let’s dive into this episode where we hear about co-founder conflicts and renaming a business.  Colleen Schnettler:We’re shutting it down. So MRR is at zero, so that’s super fun and we’re building something new.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through the wild rollercoaster of building their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today in episode three, we’re back with Colleen Schneller, a developer, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Hammer Stone. It’s been about six weeks since Colleen and I last spoke, and in preparation for our conversation, I decided to listen to the most recent episode of Colleen’s podcast and in it Colleen and her co-founder Erin chat about building their software company. So I put on the most recent episode titled MicroComp Recap, and here’s what I heard.  Aaron Francis:So that was last Thursday, then Friday, boy, boy, Friday and Saturday some stuff happened. So we broke up with the client and then you turned around and broke up with me too.  Colleen Schnettler:I totally did that.  Rob Walling:The second I heard that, all I could think was what I expected, that things may have shifted or changed within the business since our last conversation as they tend to do with a startup, but breaking up with their co-founder, I was not expecting that. Needless to say, I was anxious to speak with Colleen and have her walk me through just what happened.  Colleen Schnettler:It’s interesting, Rob, because if you think of the number of people you have conflict with in your life, at least for me it’s not that many. And when you are trying to build a business with another person, especially something that you invest so much of yourself into, there’s bound to be conflict. And Aaron and I are in an odd position as co-founders because I am full-time and he is part-time, and that is just what works for us with our family situation and things like that. But I feel so much pressure to make this work, and to me it seems like, well, if it doesn’t work for him, then he just stays at his job and nothing changes where if it doesn’t work for me, it’s a huge deal. And so I think really what was happening there was I had just stopped consulting that Thursday and on Friday I just freaked out a little bit and I was like, this is it. I am no longer making money. I have no source of income anymore. This has to work. We have to make this work, and I am the kind of person where I am going to put all of myself into this to make this work. It felt terribly unfair in that moment that I was equal partners with someone where this was a part-time gig for him. And so it’s just an odd situation to be in. And so we had a really, really serious talk about it. It was very emotional. It spanned several days just about what did we both want. And it’s not even just what do you want with the business, but what do you want with your life? What are your goals? What are we doing here? And those things are really important to be on the same page. And it’s something I had kind of brought up with him before, but we really got into it. I mean, it was just all cards on the table, what are we doing? What’s our commitment level? What do you want? And that led us initially to maybe this isn’t going to work as a partnership, but fortunately we worked it out. Like I said, it was both of us thinking a lot about what we wanted. I mean, as I told Erin, I want to make all the decisions all the time, and I don’t get to make all the decisions all the time when I have an equal partner. And again, with my equal partner being part-time on the business, it’s weird, but we worked through it. I think we handled it really well as a pretty significant discussion, fight, whatever you want to call it. I think we handled it really well and we both took some time to think about what’s our level of commitment here? What do we really want? What are our life goals? What are we doing? And by that Saturday, so that was a Friday, and then we talked again Saturday morning, I told him, I was like, I’d rather do this with you than without you even given the constraints that we have. We are a great partnership. We have complimentary skill sets and it’s really nice. I mean, I really enjoy having a co-founder. And so the thing that’s a little bit funny is that Sunday we were flying out to MicroConf and my flight landed before his, so I wasn’t a hundred percent sure he was going to get off the airplane, but he did. He showed up, we were able to have it out in person and we kind of came full circle on that one.  Rob Walling:Wow, what a story. And this is obviously something that would in a perfect world, would be hashed out before you start a company together. But the second best is before you grow to a company that’s doing millions a year, right? It’s like I have seen multiple companies implode because of this exact dynamic. They get to half a million a year, for example, and one founder wants super profitable lifestyle business, and the other one’s like, I want to raise a series A and go to 50 million or whatever it is. And so the fact that you chose now, which is still very early in your company’s life in terms of where you’re headed, the fact that you chose now to tackle this, I think shows honestly quite a bit of maturity because it is easy to push this type of thing under the rug. It sounds like you were feeling scared, frustrated, anxious, all of the above. Because as you said, you stopped consulting, which the big enterprise client you had was paying, I dunno if we said on the show, but it was like $20,000 a month. It was a lot of money and that paid for you and a bunch of other stuff. And once that stopped, it sounds like that was a real moment of reckoning for you personally.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, I think that’s a good way to describe it because I thought it was fine. I didn’t think I had that subconscious fear of not having money until I actually stopped making money and it brought all these issues that I think had been kind of simmering. It just brought all that anxiety to the surface. And when we were talking, he offered to walk away. He was like, if you don’t want to do this with me, I’ll just walk away. We don’t have to fight about it. We don’t have to get lawyers involved. But he said, we don’t have kids yet. Using the marriage analogy, which is a popular one in co-founder relationships, he’s like, I’ll walk away now. We don’t have kids AKA, we’re not at half a million dollars a year because when we are, that’s going to be a different conversation.  Rob Walling:Is there anything you wished you’d done differently around this conversation?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, they say building a business brings out the best and worst in you. And I think many people who know me would tell you that I’m like a very stable person. If I have an issue, I’m really good about bringing that issue to a person. I don’t tend to gossip about people behind their backs. I don’t tend to be frustrated. And this issue with Aaron had been simmering for a long time and I was talking to everyone except for Aaron about it. I’m happy that we had it out, but we could have done that six months earlier.  Rob Walling:In my experience, communication is really the only way to establish a relationship built on trust, which is why having these tough conversations early and setting this precedent for communication is absolutely crucial for the long-term success and sustainability of any startup. Needless to say, I’m happy for Colleen that she and Erin were able to hash this out sooner than later, but I couldn’t help but wonder how this difficult conversation affected their relationship moving forward.  Colleen Schnettler:I think it has gotten so much better. I think when there was this undercurrent of me not being a hundred percent sure if I wanted to do this with him and I had to ask him some hard questions about his commitment level and him having this undercurrent of not being sure if I was going to turn around and be angry with him for a commitment, we had these very subtle undercurrents in our relationship before we had this conversation. And so I feel like it’s been amazing, so much better since we’ve kind of had it out. Everyone’s cards are on the table, this is where we stand, this is what we’re doing. We have been able to even be more open and honest and communicate even better. Now,  Rob Walling:Colleen and Aaron are proof that having those difficult and often uncomfortable conversations can ultimately lead to a more productive path forward. And it’s encouraging to hear that things worked out as well as they did. But as many of us know, there are no shortage of challenges in the early days of a startup. And for Colleen and Aaron, their potential breakup isn’t the only challenge they faced in recent weeks. They’ve also been working through a major pivot in their core business that I was eager to learn more about.  Colleen Schnettler:Last time you and I talked, we were talking about reporting, internal reporting for Rails, and Aaron was going to go and learn Ruby on Rails. He was going to be the primary developer. And before we did that, I thought to myself, okay, let’s not invest all this time until we know that this is the right thing to build. And so I talked to many, many, many people. I am fortunate, it’s my community. So I have access to a lot of rails developers that are very senior in positions of buying power. And I talked to them all and I realized after that round of customer interviews that although our pain point is correct, our positioning and our packaging for this product, it’s not there. It’s just not there. And so we’re not going to do that.  Rob Walling:And I’m going to quote you back to yourself. You sent me an email. This is easily going to be the best or worst decision we’ve made for the business. So what is the decision? What are you doing from here?  Colleen Schnettler:So starting over, we’re shutting down. Well, we actually sold the IP to our enterprise client, but we’re essentially shutting it down, right? We’re people who have purchased it, they have it, but as I’ve communicated to them, we’re not providing support, we’re refunding them. We’re literally refunding them. I mean it’s like, sorry, didn’t work out. They have the source code and now they didn’t spend any money on it. So it’s win-win hopefully for those people. So we’re shutting it down. So MRR is at zero, so that’s super fun and we’re building something new.  Rob Walling:Okay, so what indications did you have that the prior route wasn’t working?  Colleen Schnettler:So what we were doing I realized is we were building a productized consulting business because what was happening to us is people would come in and they buy refine. I think we were selling it for a thousand dollars a year. We could have charged more, but as part of that, they wanted us hands on the code in their app, making it match their UI perfectly. So I felt a couple things were happening. We were building a productized consulting business. We had to catch them early in their lifecycle. If they really, really needed it, they would’ve already built it. And if they didn’t really need it, then what are we doing? We don’t want to be a product that is kind of sort of nice to have. We want to be a product that this is amazing. We really need this. It was hard to integrate, which is why they wanted us as part of the package. And developers aren’t really used. It was almost like we were trying to build a market, which we are do not want to do that, right? There was this red flag that we didn’t have any competitors. And you know how at first you’re like, oh, great, we don’t have any competitors. Then you’re like, oh, there’s a reason. Because developers generally speaking, they aren’t in the mindset that they go and they license, they pay for a Ruby Gem and license that that’s not their workflow. Their workflow is they want an open source package and then maybe you can upcharge them for support. But that is again, not the kind of business we want to build. I am not a big believer in the open source to paid model for a small team. I mean, I think if we had raised a lot of money, it might be a great path, but what we’re trying to build that just isn’t a model that was really working.  Rob Walling:Folks listening might be wondering, Rob, you’re an investor. TinySeed invested in this company that whose MRR is now zero. Are you panicked? It’s a pivot. Oh my gosh, it’s resetting. And the answer is no, because this is a lot more common than people realize. And the number of successful companies that go through exactly what you’re doing, the number is high. And so we bet on founders, we bet on you and Aaron not on your idea. And specifically with Hammer Stone, when a r and I got off the interview call with you, we were really like them. Don’t love developer components. It’s not a MRR, it’s not a SaaS app, but we’ll make the bet on them. That was it. Even more so do we think they will figure it out than we invest? And the answer was yes. And so do we still think you’ll figure it out? We do. And so I mean I have the confidence that you are making the right decision. You and I have obviously talked a lot about this offline, but it might come across to people like, oh my gosh, everything’s failing. But I actually think you are closer to success today than perhaps you’ve ever been. Even though your MRR doesn’t indicate that it’s like a local minimum.  Colleen Schnettler:That’s amazing to hear. That’s good  Rob Walling:News. Perhaps even more exciting is a huge pivot that Colleen and Aaron made with the direction of their company, including a name change.  Colleen Schnettler:So we are now hello query com. We’re very proud of that domain name we love Hello Query. We wanted a.com. That was a priority query obviously because our initial value prop is SQL to CSV and I dunno, I like it. Hello Query. It’s friendly. Erin and I are friendly. It feels like it’s a good match for us as people and a good match with the kind of company we want to build. And what we are now building is it’s going to be hosted internal reporting for teams. And what we love about this idea is it’s a proper SaaS. To your point before we were doing licensing of software packages, which is just a tough business model for a small team. So it’s a proper SaaS, which is great. We host it as you would imagine, and it’s actually we’re in the same space. We’re solving a very similar problem to what we initially set out to solve. We’re just solving it in what we think is just a cleaner way. We’re so excited. So I just feel like there’s so many great things about this business. I think the first is we’re no longer married to just Rails developers. We can sell this to anyone with a database. So we are opening our aperture so wide in terms of the kinds of companies that can come in and use our product. We have a lot more options now in how we charge. So now we can charge per seat instead of, again, selling a licensed software once it’s out of our hands, it was out of our hands. They had the source code they are supposed to pay every year, but so we can charge per seat. We are hoping further down the road to do partnerships with database companies, these cloud hosted database companies. It feels like something they always say first time founders talk about products, second time founders talk about distribution. And so the opportunities I think for distribution with this, with add-ons, with Heroku, everyone’s on Postgres cloud. There’s just a lot of opportunity there to hook into something that people are already using.  Rob Walling:Colleen and Erin are searching for product-market fit and getting to product-market fit is hard. I was curious to find out after they realized that their initial approach missed the mark, how did they decide their next move?  Colleen Schnettler:So I have had many, many customer conversations been doing nothing but customer discovery since we decided to pivot again. And it feels really good right now. It feels like I have had inbound people who have spoken to me this exact problem. Like Sally in accounting needs X, y, Z reports and I have to build them for her or I have to set up Aron job to email them to her. But then she wants something slightly different in the report. She wants a different date range or she wants to filter on a different column. And so I’m getting this pain fed to me by people are inbound finding us. So that feels really, really good. To be fair, this is a crowded field. There are several competitors in the space, but what I’m hearing from people, even at the air quotes, easiest ones to use are not easy. They are too complicated. I had someone who works for a relatively large company, tell me just the other day he said, I tried to set up Mease for my finance team. It was too confusing. He was like, you’re supposed to be able to copy queries and put them elsewhere, but no one could quite figure it out. And there’s just still a lot of friction. I think I have a vision for what I want this product to be in the end, but we’re stair stepping to that vision.  Rob Walling:And I imagine during these decisions are never clear, they’re never as clear as they always sound in the podcast interviews or the TechCrunch articles. I knew the whole time that I was going to build Facebook. It’s like, no, you didn’t. Let’s be honest about this. And there have to be moments for you in the past month, six weeks where you’re like, it is kind of noisy. There’s some validation you’ve just said, but also is there enough? Do we bet that you’re kind of betting the farm again on a new conclusion? Has there been a moment or moments where you’re like, this is really scary and this might be a huge mistake?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes. I think one of the big ones for us is we, Aaron and I come up with this idea. We’re like, this is going to be amazing. This is what it’s going to look like. This is why it’s going to be better. We’re going to have this really cool feature that no one else has. And that’s our one differentiating factor. And then we start doing competitor research and we find this company that has built literally what we just described and they have raised $15 million and we’re like, oh no, how are we going to compete with these guys who have raised $15 million? So yeah, I’ve had those moments.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I can imagine. And so how are you going to compete with folks who’ve raised 15 million, or not even them, but it’s a competitive space and for you, is it exciting or is it intimidating? And how are you thinking about outcompeting these folks who have a lot more money and are ahead of you?  Colleen Schnettler:It’s exciting. Since I stopped consulting, which was only three weeks ago, I’m just having the best time. This is amazing, right? It feels like freedom and it’s just like, wow, all of these things I have always wanted to do. I can now do them. I’m excited. Honestly, I think early days it’s going to be very, very clear positioning and just so easy to use. In my ideal world, I guess we would pick one industry and start in that industry, so that would be ideal. I haven’t honed in on what industry that will be, but I would love to be the BI tool for everyone in the environmental space or the BI tool for whomever. But yeah, I think it’s fun. I think honestly, just in these early days, it’s just about the personal touch. I am doing cold outreach. I am to literally anyone who will talk to me, and I’m hoping the early people that come in are people who need this. They’re frustrated with a problem and also they like the level of customer support that we are able to provide.  Rob Walling:And you’re also trying not to make, I’d say the mistake that you made earlier, which is that curse of the audience where, hey, I have hundreds or thousands of people who know me online. They like me, so when I go to pre-sell something, my friends or people who like me pay me money for this. Right? And I think you’re trying to get around that with this cold outreach.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes. It’s interesting because just the other day, Aaron and I were talking about pre-selling and what happened to us the first time is we pre-sold what seemed to be like it was like $5,000 of refined rails. So that’s not terrible. And I was so excited. I had never pre-sold anything in my life and I was like, this is going to work. And so I think what I learned later is I didn’t ask those people a lot of questions. I just was so happy to have their money. And I think what I learned later, actually, just when I did this other round of customer interviews is it came out that people were using it on hobby projects and they thought it was cool and they wanted to support us. But the hobby projects is again, not the kind of business we’re trying to build. And so I think one of the things I’m trying to be very careful with on these customer interviews, and if we do pre-sell, will be what are you using this at work? Is this something you really need? Is this going to solve the problem you have at work?  Rob Walling:It sounds to me like Colleen and Aaron are asking the right questions and not only learning from the obstacles they’ve encountered thus far, but they’re also making meaningful pivots that can potentially result in a stronger, more valuable company in the longterm. I can’t wait to hear what Colleen is doing with all her newfound freedom post consulting and to find out how much progress they’ve made building Hello Query. We’ll find out in next week’s episode.","PublishedAt":"January 30, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-753-tinyseed-tales-s4e3-co-founder-conflicts-renaming-a-business"},{"Title":"Episode 752 | The State of SEO in 2025","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 752 | The State of SEO in 2025\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t36:23\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 36:23 | Recorded on January 28, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 752, Rob Walling interviews Lars Lofgren to discuss the current state of SEO.

He really speaks his mind and is not afraid to just talk about the realities of how SEO has changed over the past several years. What’s working, what’s not the dangers he sees ahead as well as at a certain point shrugging his shoulders and saying, I just don’t know. I don’t know the details of how AI is going to impact this particular element of it. It’s a great conversation. I hope you enjoy it. But before we dive into it, MicroConf us ticket prices go up on January 31st. They go up by $200, and that’s just two or three days after this episode goes live. We are 84% sold out and every year people are asking about a wait list because they hesitated. So get your ticket before it is too late. We are going to sell this event out. It is a certainty. If you want to hang out with 250 of your closest bootstrapped founder friends, head to MicroConf dot com slash us and grab your ticket either before the price goes up or maybe even after because it’s going to sell out anyway. And that event is March 16th through 18th in New Orleans, Louisiana. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Lars. Lars Lofgren, welcome to Startups For the Rest Of Us.   Lars Lofgren:Thank you. It’s great to be here, Rob.  Rob Walling:Great to have you, man. So you and I go back, I’m thinking it more than a decade.   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, it’s like 15 years.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s lot. So you’ve spoken at MicroComp multiple times and you were basically, especially in the early days of MicroConf, just the go-to SEO speaker because you were doing so much SEO with Kissmetrics, you worked with Heaton, then you worked with Ramit Sethi at I Will Teach You to Be Rich, and then you’ve built a whole empire of high traffic. What do you call blogs, affiliate sites? I dunno, what do you call your empire?   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, I work on blogs with affiliate programs, or at least I did. We had a number of B2B blogs that we were working on. Different projects all monetized through affiliate. SEO offers organic a hundred percent organic. That’s all imploded, which we can talk about. But yeah, I got pretty far. We were doing at the height it did 7.2 million of revenue, annual revenue in a single year. That was the high point before it all collapsed on me.  Rob Walling:I’d love to just start there because that is fascinating to me. So what type of traffic does it take to generate $7.2 million in affiliate revenue?   Lars Lofgren:So it’s actually a lot less than you think. So if you’re in the right categories, that’s the thing about affiliates and especially SEO organic affiliates, and I assume socials like this too. It’s definitely going to be true on any sort of PPC or Google ads, Google AdWords, if you’re in the right categories, even if you’re only getting a couple thousand visitors on a blog post, if you’re ranking for the right blog post and the right term, you can make an extraordinary amount of money on any given month. There’s definitely power laws. The vast majority of the posts even they can rank really well, generate a ton of traffic. You don’t really make any money, make a little bit, but it all adds up over time. But then you have your few marquee posts that if you rank, you just, I mean, I had one blog posts that was literally just one post was making over a hundred thousand dollars a month off of one post, but  Rob Walling:You don’t know which those are going to be, so you just have to throw a bunch out.   Lars Lofgren:You do, if you get into the affiliate space and you talk to any of the affiliate pros that have been doing this for a long, long time, they know. They know the categories, they know the terms, everybody knows the terms, everyone. It’s not even an open secret. It’s just like, oh no, these are the categories, these are the terms. If you’re in this space, go for that one. VPN is huge. Best web hosting is huge. Best credit cards is huge. Everyone knows best credit cards. It’s the golden goose. It’s tons of traffic monetizes really well, the commission rates are through the roof. If you rank number one for best credit cards, you will make so much money. It’s obscene insurance is huge, massive. So there’s a bunch of these and the deeper you’re in the affiliate space you get the more you learn about ’em. And then it’s like, it also doesn’t take, if you’re a little savvy, if you’re just a little aware of how price points in different products and you have a keyword research tool, you just go clicking around and searching around and you find all these product categories, you’re like, wow, I know those products, those price tags are decent, which means the commission rates are probably pretty decent. There’s a lot of traffic. I bet there’s a lot of money over there and there always is.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Got it. And then you said you used to do affiliates. Things happen for those who aren’t in the loop, what did Google do this year to   Lars Lofgren:Affiliate? Yeah. Well, it really started in 2022, Google. There’s been a complete phase shift in the Google algorithm. I’ve never seen a transition this big in my entire SEO career. The way I look at SEO now, even from a year ago is completely different. Earlier this year I was banging my head against the wall. I was like, nothing is working. Nothing I do matters anymore. Google doesn’t like anything I’m doing. It’s like a existential crisis with my career. Am I any good at this still? And then I was like, okay, okay, I got to take my entire SEO playbook. I got to throw all of it out because things don’t feel right, so nothing’s working. I don’t have the pulse of Google anymore, what’s going on? So I just threw everything out. I’m like, okay, I’m rebuilding my entire SEO playbook from scratch. I’m taking nothing from granted. I’m learning every lesson over again. If I don’t see it work today, then no guarantees it still works. So there’s been this huge shift in Google and I think part of it was driven by ai. Part of it was also really around 2020. I mean it was true before this, but 2020 to 2022, there was this goldmine rush of niche affiliate sites. Word was out. We started our business in 2019, which is kind of funny. So we caught the tail end of it even though me and my co-founder knew about this space for a long time, and we were like, we knew how much money there was and let’s go do it. We like SEO, we like good content, we like helping people and we can get paid. Let’s not to, let’s go do this. But it wasn’t just us. There was this huge wave of niche affiliate sites and it kind of got taken out of control. Then on top of it, AI’s coming out, chat, GPT rolls out and content, there’s just explosion of shit content. So Google’s basically freaking out and basically like, oh, they have a real crisis on their hands. How do they actually filter through this endless wave of just trash content that they’re drowning in? So I empathize with their position a little bit, and so they basically, the algorithm has changed radically. It used to be it was to bullet down to one. I like to think in loopholes with SEO, because if you know what the big loophole is, you basically know what the algorithm, the algorithm is working at its core. The big loophole with Google used to be links. If you built enough links to the right page, you could basically rank for whatever you wanted. And that’s how we got going. To be honest, we built a bunch of links to a very few key pages and it was working really, really well. And that was true for a decade, right? Links, that’s all that mattered. If you were a better link builder and higher quality link builder than anybody else in your space, you won, period. Full stop. I’m not going to say links don’t matter anymore. They still do, but you can’t abuse the Google algorithm through links anymore. So that era ended and the new era is basically Google being like, okay, we’re not going to spend nearly as much time figuring out what pages are good. We’re just going to trust really, really major brands, really massive sites. And I think there’s a lot of nuance to how Google defines a brand. But basically if you’re a major media site, if you’re a top 100 website on the internet, top 500, something like that, you can basically just post whatever you want and rank for whatever you want. And I think the best example of this is indeed.com. I don’t know if everybody’s checked their SEO program lately, and I don’t care. I’ll talk as much about indeed as someone will let me, but their content is trash. It’s so bad. It’s such they’ve basically gone from 2 million visitors a month to I think over 20 million visitors a month. It’s just massive mind boggling growth. I struggled to get my head around it and in SEO and I’ve built a bunch of websites and it’s just a land grab of they’re just publishing endlessly. Publish, publish, publish. I’m not going to accuse them of doing AI content, but it looks like AI content. Or even worse, I think if there are any writers that are working on this program, they should actually just use AI because the content will get better, the end, they’ll save time and everybody will get paid more. The only people that are benefiting from this are like the SEO folks at Indeed and the writers themselves. So someone should make some of this money anyway, but that’s the state that we’re in. If you have the right domain that has the right signals that Google is looking for, you basically get a free pass. And if you’re on the opposite end of the spectrum and you don’t have those signals, things can get crazy volatile and really, really dicey. And that era we were doing really, really well in the old era of Google. We were not set up to do well in the new era of Google, the brand era, these monolith website era, this monolith brand. Those are the major players that can basically do whatever they want. So that’s the world we live in right now.  Rob Walling:I want to go down two paths and one is talk about big brands being able to do whatever they want, and there’s this term that I’ve heard thrown around called parasite, SEO. All right, let’s put a pin in that. We’ll come back to it in a few minutes. What I want to touch on is the listeners of this show are a lot of entrepreneurs, some early stage, a lot of folks doing 6, 7, 8 figures, a RR their SaaS. So when they hear you saying, oh, you have to have a brand Indeed, or C Nnn have to be a top 500, that might scare someone off who’s like, well, I’m doing 10 grand, 20 grand a month right now. Should I think about SEO and what’s your take on that?   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, so what I used to tell people, I’ve done so many consulting calls with first time SaaS founders or bootstrap folks that are trying to figure out what marketing channels and what I used to tell people is, okay, all the channels work. Pick one that really resonates with you and you really go focus on it. Online channel is essentially power law. All the gangs are at the end focus, don’t get spread too thin. And if you like writing, if blogs resonate with you, if the SEO world resonates with you, go all in and you can get really far. In fact, this is why I spent my whole career in SEO because it’s one of the only marketing channels that’s the full marketing funnel. You get very top of funnel, you get mid funnel, you get bottom funnel. There’s always something to do with Google and SEO and even I’ve played around with every single channel at different points in my career and nothing has ever beaten SEO on the scalability, the ROI, the profit per lead, the volume, it hits all the buckets. The downside was it always takes forever. It takes five years to get anywhere interesting with it. So that’s what I used to tell people. If you’re excited by it, go all in. It’ll take you everywhere you need to go. If you’re not excited by it, well then maybe don’t do it because it’s going to take five years these days. I’m like, look, I’m an SEO purist, or at least I want to be. I have to have let that go. I can’t a hundred percent focus on SEO anymore. It’s too volatile. And the way Google is working is yes, the big brands get this free pass. There’s a lot of nuance to what Google is considering a brand, and there are ways to get going as a smaller site, a newer site with a lot less content, with a much smaller brand. But you have to balance whatever you’re doing with SEO with some other channels. And if you want a really simple rule that would give any founder or new marketing team that’s trying to balance things out, I’d be like, okay, even on day one, even as a founder, I don’t want, I focus, so it pains me to say this, but it is the truth. I would say you have to go all in. I guess it’s not all in anymore, but you have to go in on it least three channels. One channel is top of funnel. Pick a social channel that matches your audience and brand and what you like. You don’t have too many options. Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn  Rob Walling:X, Twitter,   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, x, Twitter, whatever we’re calling it the butterfly blue sky thing, whatever. So pick one of those and that’s your top of funnel. Do some SEO if you’re really excited by it, and then build your email list from day one and get regular emails out so that they’re warm and that’s building. You basically can’t just devote yourself to one channel like SEO anymore. And there’s two reasons for this. One is the easy one is diversification. SEO is volatile. Stuff bounces around all over the place. I don’t even consider a 30% hit anymore to be like noteworthy. I’m just like, oh, we’re down by 30%. Okay,  Rob Walling:Wow.   Lars Lofgren:Earlier in my career, a 40% hit was a six month fire drill and it never happened. Now that stuff happens really regularly. If someone’s telling me that they got hit on SEO, I’m like, look, if you didn’t drop by 80%, don’t call me. It’s not even a hit. Things are crazy and volatile. It feels like the volatility of social, but paired with all the long-term nuances of SEO, it’s a much deal and it used to be. So you need that diversification. But on top of that, when Google is looking at things to rank and deciding who ranks for what they do place a lot more emphasis in, okay, is this site, is this brand? Is this entity? Are they on social? Are they doing stuff in other channels? Is the traffic coming to this website, non-search traffic, is there a bunch of branded keywords for this website? All this other stuff. It is definitely not SEO stuff, it’s the full marketing bucket. So if you properly diversify, the SEO game is actually going to get a lot easier for you over time. I’m working on a couple different sites right now with various degrees of brands. The site that has, it’s still a pretty big brand. Most people listening to this would be like, that’s a decent brand. And I’d be like, yeah, it is a decent brand, but they’re not, haven’t invested as heavily into other marketing channels. It’s been very SEO and blog dominant, and I have to work my off on that site. Nothing is a given. Yes, Google will give me a shot, but I got to show up and do the real work, working on another website, massive brand, huge brand, tons of social stuff going on, all sorts of crazy brand things. And every time I turn around, the numbers are all up. It is just all the charts look great. I’m like, I just have to post publish, keep publishing. Good things happen. So it is a crazy world, but if you diversify your channel a little bit, it’s going to make everything easier. And so don’t get too locked in on one channel is my main advice. And you can get somewhere. You can make progress. My personal blog, lar lre.com, there’s not too many blog posts on it, but I’m doing stuff on LinkedIn. I’m doing these podcasts, I’m getting my name out there and my stuff is ranking pretty fast. I don’t post that much, don’t make any money off this thing, but when I post, it feels healthy and it’s much smaller. So there’s still things you can do. You have plenty of cars to play, but you got to diversify.  Rob Walling:Wow. It’s crazy. It makes sense when you say it, but it’s crazy to hear that this is where SEO is. I remember back in the day, do you remember private blog PBNs Large where you had set up a exact match domain with dashes in it? It’s like the dash chiropractor dash in dash fresno where some.com, and then you’d build some links with the PB n. It’s like, look, we rank. And it was just, but that’s what Google just hates that stuff, right? It’s like people gaming the system and it feels like this is a big backlash to that.   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, it is a huge backlash. Basically Google decided to hell with SEOs, and I mean kind if you want a good rule of thumb on tactical SEO level, don’t do any of the SEO stuff that was popular that people have been talking about for a decade. If you join some SEO course and they’re like, yeah, get bold your anchor text and get all this internal, all these formulas and or get a fac at the bottom of the post and optimize it. There was a playbook and all that stuff worked really well. We were doing some of it and it worked great. But all that stuff actually I think is how much is causation versus correlation? But I’m inclined to believe that a lot of it will actually hurt your rankings now because Google basically went to the opposite end of the spectrum and said, look, if this thing even smells like an SEO touched it, we’re going to just nuke it to oblivion. And they certainly 100% do that at a domain level. And then we could argue about how much it happens at a page level. But I’ve thrown out all those old little hacks. I don’t do any of ’em anymore at all  Rob Walling:For folks listening to this. I’m invested in over 200 B2B SaaS companies and a huge percentage of them and 60, 70, 80% somewhere in there are doing SEO and are getting some content marketing and SEO and are getting results from it. So what I don’t want to do is paint a picture for everybody of SEO is dead or you shouldn’t do it or anything, but you’re pointing out these pitfalls of following old playbooks and potentially just how volatile it be, especially when you get to scale. And I think that’s another thing is a lot of the SaaS I’m invested in are, they’re in these type verticals that where it’s just not, you’re not getting hundreds of thousands of uniques. It’s like, Ooh, if I can get 8,000 uniques a month from long tail SEO, that’s actually a huge win for these folks because their A CV is high enough that you just don’t need a ton of volume. And I don’t get the feeling that they’re under as much, nearly as much scrutiny as all the stuff that you’re talking about.   Lars Lofgren:As long as there’s, again, you keep that balance on the brand and your other marketing channels, I think that the danger is when your SEO channel, regardless of how small you are or how big you are, you’d be doing a thousand visitors a month. You can be doing a million visitors a month. If your SEO program gets overweighted compared to your other marketing channels, that’s when things can start to get dangerous. And that’s when even a SaaS business can that has a pretty defined niche can run into trouble. So even if SEO is going really well for someone, yeah, go do your niche, go dominate that core, but also be careful. Don’t be really careful about spreading beyond your core focus and your core niche too much. And especially if your niche starts to involve a lot of very similar keywords. Maybe there’s a local element to the keyword law keyword or regulation keyword or something that’s different from every city in every state or there’s something, or celebrity net worth is another classic. There’s just thousands and thousands and thousands of these things. And you could create a huge website just going after celebrity net worth keywords, and people have done that and gotten burned. If there’s some keyword type like that where it fragments really fast, and if you just chase all of it, you’ll end up with hundreds and thousands of blog posts. Be really careful about that stuff. If you went after it, you blog could get really overweighted on content and SEO, and if it gets too overweighted from the rest of your brand, that’s where the volatility element starts to come in.  Rob Walling:Alright, I want to talk about AI before we get to parasite, SEO. So I have two questions for you around AI specifically involving trying to rank for terms. So number one is AI can write blog posts these days and I can go to, what is it? Claude and Chat, GPD AI can generate it and there’s all these startups in the space of we’ll generate, but whatever. What’s your take? Do you use it? Should people use it?   Lars Lofgren:So I hate ai, at least when it comes to creating content. I can’t stand it. So that’s just my personal, I just have this neurosis around it, get this stuff away from me. So I’m pretty biased, but even if I put that aside, I’m like, okay, does it make sense to do this for a content program? And I am an emphatic 100%, no. Plenty of ways to use ai hats off. People go do it great brainstorming. You want some feedback on your article, whatever. Great. Occasionally if I’m feeling really stuck, I’ll ask it to give me some suggestions on a headline and that usually unblocks me and keeps me moving. So there’s ways to use it as a little bit of a crutch, but use it as a crutch, don’t have it, do the whole thing. And I know a lot of people are doing it for their blog content. It is rampant, it is everywhere. If you get pretty good with your prompts, you could have definitely an average level blog post, maybe even slightly above average, and it would certainly meld very well with a bunch of other stuff ranking. It wouldn’t be blatantly problematic if you put in the work on ai. We actually did a ton the first year that AI came out, of course all of our whole business was content, so we freaked out. We were like, oh my God. And one of our teams went all in on just using AI and trying to, does it work? How well does it work? What’s the potential of this thing? And the conclusion we got to was like, look, it can produce the quality that we would accept and be willing to publish. However, you have to put so much work into it that it’s basically a wash. Instead of having a number of reasonably paid writers and freelancers doing all the content you need a few really hardworking, very diligent, very highly paid people to run these AI algorithms that really know what they’re doing that can have a great eye for content and also know how to torture the algorithms in order to get what you actually need. Quality level. And when you look at the cost, it’s like it’s not a huge difference. So the time the spend is about the same. I also have the opinion that, look, everyone’s going into AI content and AI is really good at giving you that core middle of the bell curve answer. And if they’re giving you something, they’re going to give the other thousand people in your space something pretty similar, what AI does. And so if you’re using it, you’re just going to be the middle of the bell curve. Well, marketing isn’t about the middle of the bell curve. That’s not how you win. You got to stand out, you got to do things differently, unexpected. You got to break a norm of some kind. You got to be your pursue excellence, go way above the curve. AI can’t do any of that stuff, in my opinion, especially when it comes to content. So if I’m trying to get my content to break through the noise, the last thing I want is to build a program or a team that’s completely dependent on just feeding people more of what they’re already getting. We got to do things differently. So I’m running content programs on several sites right now, and I have told all my freelancers, if you use ai, if you copy and paste anything from AI into anything in your post, if I ever find it, we’re done. You can use it for brainstorming, you can use it for outline to get unblocked. That’s fine research, although to check every fact because a lot of it’s wrong, but everything that you hand me in your final post, you need to write it yourself. And that is a hard rule, and I would give that to any serious team going all in on content marketing or whatever they’re doing regardless of the channel. Be really careful how you use it if you want to actually stand out and get somewhere. Interesting.  Rob Walling:That’s good advice. And that’s the same advice I’ve heard from other SEOs that I’ve talked to Ruben Gomez being one. He’s like, yeah, we don’t, nah, it’s not it. It’s too vanilla. I think of it as it’s a mayonnaise sandwich. It’s just this bland, even for us, we ship a YouTube video every other week through MicroConf, and it’s usually me talking to a screen about something about churn or about us bootstrapping and ideas and this and that. I have tried to use AI to help me even just outline the videos of like, well, I’m going to talk about three things you can do to improve your a CV this week. So I’m going to ask AI, and I’ll even ask GPT, pretend you’re Rob Walling because it’ll do that now. It’s kind of cool. So then it’ll pull from maybe weight itself a little more to my stuff, and I still find that I’ll look at the outline and be like, this is such a mediocre, it’s like a C   Lars Lofgren:So generic,  Rob Walling:It’s a 70%, and that’s not the video that I want to ship.   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, it’s the middle of the bell curve, just enough to get through and look. Again, I’m trying to declare my biases on these. I enjoy writing. Even in my spare time, I’ll go work on a blog or whatever the right, but I also deeply believe that if I think about all my best posts, all my best pieces of content, I had to sit and wrestle with that thing and actually figure out what I was thinking and what I believed in through the process of just writing and the outline or the hook or where that post ended usually at a very different place than when I started. So I see value in that process, and if I actually am willing to do the work on the content, I usually end up someplace way, way, way better. And you’re never going to get that with ai. You’re already hammed in, even if it is an outline. So I don’t use it for any writing at all, but I think I’m a halfway decent writer and I do enjoy it. So someone might have a different opinion.  Rob Walling:Second AI topic is when I go to Google today and I type in a search for, it’s at least half of the searches I do in Google. Now, the ai, is that Baird? What is it called out of Claude? I don’t even know. It’s Google’s ai, right?   Lars Lofgren:Gemini. Gemini. That’s what it’s, well, there’s like two different ones. The Gemini is the actual AI chat thing, and then the SEO is called the little snippet, AI overviews overviews. So AI O is usually what it’s truncated to  Rob Walling:Shockingly good. I asked it the other day. I mean, I ask it about acronyms all the time, talk to a founder and they’ll say it’s called an acronym, and I just go ask AI what it is. I’m sorry, I go ask Google, but at least half the time now I’m not clicking links. It might be more than that. So there’s blue links somewhere on that page. There’s ads on that page. I’m not clicking any of that. What’s your take on the search engine result pages, and is AI make them irrelevant or do we not have blue links? Where is this headed?   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, that is a great question and I don’t have any answers. I do have plenty of sleepless nights and existential threat about it. So if some other founder is worried about this, I’ll be like, join the club. If you’re in Seattle, we’ll get drunk. So I mean, I think it’s another reason for doing content kind of the hard way and finding a reason to stand out. Yeah, if you’re, your content is kind of running the mill content where it can get answered instantly, or it’s a query that’s featured. Snippets did this to a lot of sites over time where someone’s looking for a definition and then boom, it’s right there in the featured snippet, or it’s just one little effect that’s going to be, the bulk of your content is dependent on that. A lot of that traffic’s going to go away. It’s going to go way down. So I’m not too worried about that. Like, okay, I have to win on high quality content that actually helps people and says something that they’re not expecting and gives them genuine value. Great, I’ll compete on that all day long. That’s my sweet spot. That’s what I enjoy doing. What I actually worry about is, okay, a lot of these AI answers are actually wrong, but I also know that people, I’m not judging anybody. People like convenience. I’m a maniacal person that just will go to crazy lengths to find the truth, and I’m always digging and searching and anybody tells me anything, and the first thing I think is like, ah, it’s probably what’s the real answer? That’s just my default state of mind. But I know a lot of people, they’re just going to give what AI gives them. So if you’re searching on some topic, you’re getting some best practices. How many people just accept it and bounce, even though all the best practices are trash, right? I’m like, what I’m more worried about is for the content that’s worth digging into, how many people are actually going to want to go look at the real thing from someone that actually knows what they’re talking about? Or is Google just going to leave all those folks behind and the SERPs going to get up to the point where you can’t even find that stuff? Then what does that do to a blog over time? What does that do to the marketing funnel over time? Even if you’re doing all the real work and you really have something to say and you really know what you’re talking about, does SEO essentially just wilt because you don’t get any placement at all? That might happen. I’ve got my whole careers in SE and I’m like, ah, where’s this going? I don’t know. So right now, I am praying and crossing my fingers and I am seeing, I have this small little blog on HR called HR advice, HR advice.com, and I did get someone, I have a really, really small email list, and I ask people when they sign up the email, so I have an automated follow-up saying, Hey, how did you find this? How’d you find out about this website? It would really help me out, and I got my first response. It was like, Hey, I actually found a lot of your articles on PTO and PTO policies while searching through chat TPT, and I found your articles really, really helpful. So I have the optimistic side of me, or maybe the hopeful or blind or whatever. This is rationally optimistic that doesn’t want to consider this world ending of content marketing. There is a part of me that believes that, okay, traffic’s going to go way down across the board. People are just going to use perplexity or chat GBD or Google, and they’re just going to get that bullshit overview. That doesn’t really tell you anything, and for most people, that’s going to be enough and you’ll never get that traffic. They’ll never even hit your site. But there’ll be a small percentage of those people, the people that actually care about the subject that are like, okay, here’s an overview of how call to actions work, but I need someone that actually knows how call to actions work. My boss is breathing down my neck, and I’m not just going to accept the initial bullshit 500 word overview. I’m going to dig and I’m going to click on stuff and I’m going to ask a bunch of other questions and I’m going to try to get to the source. There are those people out there that actually want real information, and I think some of ’em are going to keep clicking and they’re going to keep digging, and we could end up in a world where blog volume, blog traffic is way, way, way down. All the absolute numbers that I started my career on, all those will just go away. But this is the hopeful part. What I’m hoping is that the quality of what’s actually hits your site, those folks are dramatically higher than what you see in aggregate now because they need the real answers and they’re going to dig and they’re going to click on all your stuff and they’re going to find you and keep working in your funnel. So maybe absolute traffic comes way down on a blog or a site or a channel or whatever you’re doing, but the conversion rates go way up. That’s my hopeful coping rationality to get, we will see,  Rob Walling:Right? Yeah. None of us know. I want to wrap up by circling back to this topic that I mentioned a couple times already. Parasite, SEO. It’s a term I had never heard before a few months ago. Seems like it came around because of this brand shift, and so if you have this amazing brand, it sounds like you can publish whatever the hell you want.   Lars Lofgren:Is  Rob Walling:That it? So define this term and tell us the story behind it.   Lars Lofgren:So just how I talked about indeed, there’s a lot of other sites that hit framework. There’re so big, they have so much traffic. There’s so many people hitting their website through so many different mechanisms, news websites, mass media publications. They’re the classic example of this. They fit that brand preference algorithm perfectly right now, and they have, it started, started around 2022, early 2022 is when it really kicked off, and it just has gone, Google for whatever reason, keeps doubling down on this. I thought they’d shift gears by the end of 2022 or taper things. I was already seeing it and they were like, no, no, let’s just keep going. Let’s give these folks everything. It’s just Reddit. And they’re like, ah, give ’em everything. And a bunch of people in the affiliate space, they figured this out. Everyone’s looking at the rankings, you can see who’s ranking, and they were like, wait, these news publishers rank for everything. Why don’t we set up some sort of partnership with them as a separate entity? Like, oh, I have my own holding company. We run all of our SEO content and affiliate monetization and link building programs in-house. Why don’t I go to some news publisher of some kind and basically be like, okay, you’re going to set up a folder on your website, a subsite within your site, something that I can basically piggyback off your entire domain authority and the preference you have in Google. And then we are going to ship thousands and thousands and thousands of SEO optimized posts, and these are all the old school SEO posts. It is just the same framework, same templates, same stuff that SEOs have been doing for a decade,  Rob Walling:But it’s not high quality. It’s just average mediocre,   Lars Lofgren:In my opinion. Best case scenario. It’s like it’s okay content. It’s pretty hard to find a post at least I have had a hard time finding posts that are like, this is really good. This post deserves to rank at best. It’s like, okay, it’s fine. A lot of it, I’m like, this is bad. This’s terrible. I don’t know why this ranks, it shouldn’t rank. So Google kind of stopped looking at page level metrics and kind of gave the domain weighting way too much weight. And yeah, the affiliate folks in the industry has figured this out, and there’s a few kind of affiliate companies that ended up brokering deals with every major news publisher out there. I’m not going to name names, but everyone has heard of these, folks have heard of these sites, and you’ve probably seen them everywhere for a while. And the term SEO started calling this a parasite, SEO. It’s when a third party sets up shop with the main kind of host domain, and then they run this subsection of the site and they just spew out tons of SEO content. It ranks, they’re abusing the authority of the website, and then of course it’s ranking really well, and they’re making a ton of, we’re talking like tens of millions of dollars a month, hundreds of millions of dollars a year when it’s fully scaled and fully operational. These are just colossal amounts of money. There’s a few companies that kind of specialized in this and got multiple agreements with multiple news orgs and it got rampant, and they’re, well, Google has put out a bunch of new policies and a bunch of manual actions, and a lot of these programs have been hit. So there’s been a lot of volatility in the last couple months. But yeah, I mean, when Google prefers something, SEO folks will figure it out and they’ll figure out how to abuse it. It’s as old as time,  Rob Walling:And then Google eventually catches wind. They figure out, they know, and then they do the penalty, and then the race begins again, right?   Lars Lofgren:Yeah. Pendulum goes the other way. Everybody freaks out, and then,  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s a trip. Well, Lars Lofgren, thanks so much for joining me on the show. If folks want to keep up with you, lars lofgren.com, you have an email list there if folks want to hear the real story around SEO, content, marketing, entrepreneurship, whatever else, whatever else you’re up to.   Lars Lofgren:Yeah, whatever marketing rants, whatever’s bothering me at the moment, try to be entertaining.  Rob Walling:Awesome. So that’s lars lofgren.com. Thanks again for joining me. Thanks,   Lars Lofgren:Rob.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Lars for coming on the show, and thank you for listening this week and every week.

And with that, let’s dive into season four, episode two of TinySeed Tales.  Colleen Schnettler:Oh man. It’s like having both kind of felt like a safety net, and I know that’s a false feeling, but you’re like, oh, well, if it doesn’t work out in Rails, it’s okay because we have Layer Valve. If it doesn’t work out in Layer Valve, it’s okay. We have Rails. It kind of felt like spreading the net wide, like lots of small bets if you will, gave us this safety. It gave me a feeling of safety, and so to go all in on one stack is I absolutely think the smart thing to do, but it’s also scarier because if it doesn’t work, then you’re like, oh, shoot. Now what?  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through their struggles, victories, and failures as they build their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today on episode two, we’re back with Colleen Schettler, a developer, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Hammer Stone. It’s been about six weeks since Colleen and I last spoke, so I reached out to her via email to find out if anything notable had happened since our last conversation. As many of us know when it comes to building startups, it’s not uncommon to go through periods of time where although you’re grinding, nothing terribly noteworthy has occurred. But when I heard back from Colleen, I was shocked by how many interesting things have been happening with Hammer Stone. One recent development is Colleen and her co-founder Erin, have made the decision to build a reporting dashboard into their product. I was curious to learn more about this additional functionality and what inspired Colleen and Erin to build it.  Colleen Schnettler:So the product as it stands right now is a drop in filter builder component. So what that means is you as the developer, or let’s say you’re the product manager and you want to buy this, you then have to have your developer drop it in, but he or she also has to do a lot of customization to hook it up. And one of the hardest technical issues we keep running into is if people are going to pay a large amount of money for a product, they want it to match their UI perfectly. Frontend UI customization for a composable query builder is just a bear. It is so hard and we keep changing things and trying to give people more, make it more customizable, but fundamentally, what keeps happening is the most painful part of this product. It’s not the query building, which you think that’d be the hard part, but that’s not really the hard part. It’s the front end UI customization, and what we were finding is people are putting this on index views or whatever, and they’re building reports. Fundamentally, people are using this to build reports, only query builder. No one knows what that is. So even positioning that and trying to sell that is really hard. People are what? Wait, what does it do? Can you explain it again? And so the positioning on it is really tough, and ultimately 85 to 90% of the use case is just reporting anyway. So we, after talking to several customers who have purchased the product that we have, we realized there’s an opportunity here to build out reporting. We own the UI on that, so we don’t have this. It has to fit in perfectly with your existing index views. We own the whole page, we own the ui, and we can build out this functionality we keep telling you you can do. So when we sell QueryBuilder, we say things like, oh, you can use it to schedule background jobs so your customers can get an email every week of who purchased their product. But then you as the purchaser of our product, have to build that out. Reporting gives us the company Hammer, stone, the ability to build all that out for you and just sell you a real true drop in solution.  Rob Walling:How did you come to this solution? As you describe it, sounds completely obvious to me. I find that things that look completely obvious in retrospect are not completely obvious when you have 20 different data points. It’s this muddy thing of like, should we do this? Should we build it in a third language? You have PHP, you have Ruby already. Do we expand into a third language? Or you have 20 different options that you could have done and you’re deciding to do this one. How did you get here?  Colleen Schnettler:So we want to be focused. I think we’re a small team with limited resources and we are trying to throw our net too wide. Isn’t that always the advice you give to Bootstrappers? You need to niche down, niche down. So we’re trying to focus and just hitting the same pain points over and over with customers who purchase it. I have this on the rail side, people are not using it in production, not yet customizable enough, and they’re like, really? We want to give our customers what we keep hearing over and over. These are reports for our customers. Our customers come in and they want to be able to find X, Y, and Z, so I have to build them the report. And so we had to make a decision. We felt that these multiple products and multiple frameworks was not focused enough, so we needed to make a decision and we feel like this is a focused decision. And honestly, it’s so funny you wouldn’t think this, but this positioning matters. We really, as a tech person, you like to believe that’s not true. You’re like, you’ll just see the beauty of the product, but we can’t sell it. We can’t freaking explain it. So reporting feels very explainable to people.  Rob Walling:Colleen is spot on. Reporting is very explainable. This pivot also requires effective positioning. As she mentioned, as builders and makers, we often believe that the product should simply sell itself, but unfortunately products don’t do that. There are a lot of strategies you can use when trying to reposition a product like changing the website or having conversations with customers. I asked Colleen if she’d tried any of these tactics yet and if so, how they’re working out.  Colleen Schnettler:So we haven’t done anything on our website, we haven’t repositioned that, but what we’re doing is when people come to us about QueryBuilder, we also are showing them our mockup UI of what reporting dashboard is going to look like. And nine times out of 10, they say that’s what they’re trying to build anyway. I mean, it feels like it’s going to be, the signals are good, I guess.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s where sometimes you find an avenue that instantly feels like, oh, this works, this works. If you’re saying nine out of 10, that’s an incredible win because I’ve seen folks try to do a pivot like this or an expansion or whatever, and maybe it’s five out of 10 and it’s still the right call because the other five want five different things, but at least if you can get half the people to want the same thing, then you have a market there that’s really cool. So they’re already trying to build this and it’s really just we’re going to take on more of the functionality. I think of it a little bit, think of all these tools that we’ve seen just expand and expand and expand. They’re at a larger scale, but HubSpot, it was a website builder with Google Analytics built into it. It was very simple, and then they’re like, now we’re going to add SEO tools, now we’re going to add a CRM, now we’re going to add whatever. I mean, HubSpot’s just this big, right? And they’re a public company and all that, but in a way, you found that you built something that was worth something but maybe not enough and it got you to where you are today, which is great. It’s almost like, oh, we got to step one. It’s like this is the next piece of functionality around it. Is there something beyond that? Have you even thought about it? Or I guess you’re still thinking, let’s just get slowed down. Let me get this thing shipped before we even think about that.  Colleen Schnettler:Well, it’s interesting because our original hypothesis or dream with this company was to build developer components. So yeah, it feels like there is something beyond it. I mean, we’re already starting to think bigger, which is exciting. We’re focusing on Rails and Aaron, my co-founder comes from Laravel where they have this beautiful admin panel and he’s like, what are you using Rails? I was like, nothing. We all use a hodgepodge of open source components that kind of sort of work, and you make ’em work the way you want ’em to, but there feels like there is something beyond this. There’s an opportunity to maybe it’s reporting and we become profitable in that space. Maybe it’s a full admin dashboard, maybe it’s taking some of the things that are missing in our framework and bringing them to the framework as paid add-ons. We feel like there’s a lot of potential here.  Rob Walling:I’m really looking forward to seeing what Colleen and Erin do in the coming months with all that potential. Another area they appear to have made a lot of progress in is deciding to focus on one element of the product line that is proven to be more successful, but reaching that decision wasn’t as simple as it sounds.  Colleen Schnettler:So in just the last episode we talked about how we are going after both the Laravel and the Rails markets and we have a product in both of those markets. And the interesting thing about this is the product is functionally the same, but practically it’s two completely different products, different code bases, different customers, different go to market strategies, and I perpetually feel like we’re not moving fast enough, and one of the things we were talking about is how do you succeed? You got to run experiments until you figure out what works. So let’s keep running experiments and in the Laravel space, we have run what I would consider three experiments now. We built Aaron, my co-founder, built this beautiful drop in query builder component and we tried to sell it and five people bought it right? There was not a knocking down of the doors for it. Then our next experiment was, okay, it’s because it’s not easy enough to integrate. Let’s integrate it in their paid add-on, which is called Laravel Nova, which is the Laravel admin dashboard. So then we built it so it integrates exactly perfectly into Laravel Nova and we’re like, oh, this is it. Now it’s going to be a one click installation. Everyone’s going to buy it. No one it. And then so now we’re on experiment three if you’re counting. Then we said, oh, it’s because the price anchoring in Laravel is so low. It’s way, way, way too expensive. And so we dropped the price and we thought, oh, now we’re going to drop the price. That’s it. This is the gates are going to open, and we sold four. So it feels like to us, we have run three experiments in the Laravel space and we have shown that that market has a low propensity to pay for things, and if you look at the customers we’re getting in rails versus the customers we’re getting in Laravel and Laravel getting a lot of hobbyist in rails. We’re getting a lot of companies. And so when you look at the propensity to pay, we think the rails market is just a little more mature and the people are coming to us are more likely to pay for things, and so we’re holding these facts in our hands. This literally, we decided this last week and we’re like, okay, what do we do? And we’re, it feels like we’re working on two different things. We’re like, we’ve got to be rowing in the same direction. We need to be working together, common vision, common goal, and so we think we’re relatively confident we are going to focus both of our efforts on the rail space to test experiments in that space.  Rob Walling:How did it feel once you made that decision last week?  Colleen Schnettler:I mean, it feels scary because, oh man, it’s having both kind of felt like a safety net, and I know that’s a false feeling, but you’re like, oh, well, if it doesn’t work out in rails, it’s okay. We have layer valve. If it doesn’t work out in rail valve, it’s okay. We have rails. It kind of felt like spreading the net wide, lots of small bets if you will, gave us this safety. It gave me a feeling of safety. And so to go all in on one stack is I absolutely think the smart thing to do, but it’s also scarier because if it doesn’t work, then you’re like, oh, shoot. Now what?  Rob Walling:Asking yourself now what is something I’m sure we can all relate to? I see this often from indie hacker types. They launch and they get that quick hit of dopamine from a product hunt launch only to then realize that the project gets little or no traction, or if they did get some uptick, they don’t actually want to market and sell it, which bringing us full circle leaves them asking themselves now. So I see folks try to diversify by having a bunch of irons in the fire, but I think the lack of focus means nothing gets enough momentum to get traction. If you recall from episode one, Aaron is a Laravel developer, while Colleen is a Rails developer and seeing as how their focus has shifted more into Rails, I was curious to find out how this impacts Aaron.  Colleen Schnettler:Aaron is a phenomenal developer, a great product designer, and he can churn out code so fast. I am a very, very good developer, but I would say his skills exceed mine in that arena. And so our relationship up until last week has been that he does all the product kind of design development and I do everything that turns that into a business. So I’m the Rails developer, so this is going to be an interesting shift for us to figure out how we both fit. And I think that’s too part of the reason I’m nervous how we both fit into the company with this new vision and we’re still trying to figure that out. He loves Laravel and the community, so hopefully we get to a point where we will be able to work on both products, but right now we’re thinking he’s going to learn Rails, which is kind of fun and I think could be really good marketing content, honestly, because he excels as a developer relations person, so him learning rails and tweeting about it would get a ton of eyeballs on our content. So we feel like that’s probably the path forward. But it’s interesting. It puts us both outside of our comfort zone.  Rob Walling:Stepping outside of your comfort zone is never easy, but a senior developer, Aaron shouldn’t have too much trouble picking up a new concept or even a new programming language. I’ve always been shocked by how quickly the senior devs I work with were able to pick up new languages and not just pick ’em up but really understand them. I’ll be sure to get an update on that next time I sit down with Colleen. Let’s shift gears a bit and talk about hiring. In a recent email Colleen sent me, she wrote, I hired a new developer. He’s awesome, but the hiring was terrible. I’ve hired in the past and I have a process I’ve used that didn’t work out, so this time I did it properly and it was a huge pain, but totally worth it. Let’s find out what exactly was so horrible about the hiring process, including what she’s tried in the past and what she did this time around.  Colleen Schnettler:So what I’ve done in the past is, this is embarrassing to admit, but it is what it is. I basically said on my podcast, which was relatively popular, that I was hiring people Twitter DMed me or emailed me and I said, that seems great. And we just started working together or someone, a friend of a friend was like, Hey, I’ve worked with this person. He’s great. I said, okay, cool. I just hired them with no thought, rhyme or reason to if they were a good fit for what I was trying to do. It was a good, I mean, you think about this in terms of learning so much of this startup journey For me even I’ve only been full-time on the business for two months and I just feel like I’m learning at this incredibly accelerated rate, and so I try to look at these experiences as learning experiences instead of, holy cow, why did I do that? That was stupid.  Rob Walling:Oh yeah. Oh, it’s absolutely a learning experience and that’s one of the reasons we’re on a podcast right now is so that people listening will hopefully not make the same mistakes that you’ve made that I’ve made. What is the old quote? It’s like a wise person learns from the mistakes of others, and I feel like, yeah, learning you’re doing is a greatly accelerated pace once you’re full-time focused on something and you start doing new things that maybe you haven’t done in the past. So what was the new process then? Posting a job description, doing interviews, all that.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, so I heard about Dan Martel’s book on your podcast actually. So I bought the book, I read it in a weekend. So I was feeling real inspired and then I took a more measured approach to it, and I think the biggest thing that didn’t work out with the early people I hired, they were all wonderful. There was no problem except that I had not set expectations, And at some point, I don’t know, I expected ’em to read my mind. I don’t know what I thought they were going to do with no expectations, and so I just hadn’t written down what I really needed when the person didn’t deliver what I really needed, and then I’m talking to him two months later. Of course, it didn’t work out. There’s no way this time I started with a proper job description, here is what I really need. And I posted that job description on a couple rails, job boards, got tons of applicants. It was amazing. That’s good and bad though. Then you have to go through them all.  Rob Walling:I know what that feels like. Yeah,  Colleen Schnettler:Got tons of applicants. And one of the things I did is I put a really, I don’t want to say easy, but I put a little coding challenge two liner in the form, in the application form just to weed out people who actually were paying attention. And so yeah, I went through all these job applications. I did intro calls with seven people, and then I wrote up a coding challenge and I gave the coding challenge to four people, and then I selected one person based on that. But even things like a coding challenge, you’re like, man, this is kind of a pain. What do I do to come up with what’s relevant to come up with? And just the logistics around that. You got to come up with something, but I didn’t want to just grab something off the shelf. I wanted something that was specific. What we do is very specific, and one of the things I was really filtering for was communication, because I work with this person really, really closely. So how do you communicate? How far do you go when you have an issue before you reach out to me? So I made a custom coding challenge, and we do a lot of stimulus and hot wires, so I needed to make sure they actually had stimulus and hot wire knowledge and things like that. So it did work out, but it was like I’ve been color coding my days, energy levels, green, yellow, red. That was a lot of red that week.  Rob Walling:Rob, I can imagine. I want to touch on a couple things that we talked about there. One is I don’t want it to come across, it’s not okay to out of your network because it is, I’ve done it. I’ve had it work. Tracy Osborne, TinySeed program manager, was a microcom speaker in 2016 and kind of was in the orbit. I didn’t know her very well, but we had a full job description. We posted it publicly. We got a bunch of applicant. She was one, and I was like, Ooh, I think this could be a winner. But then she went through a full interview process, you know what I mean? She went with an upfront and a second, and then there was an offer letter. Everything was as official as if we did not know her. And so I want a listener, speaking of learning from mistakes or experience for me when we hire today, like producer Ron who helps produce this podcast in our YouTube channel. He has been a tenure listener of startups For the Rest Of Us, for example. So he is in our community in essence, but full hiring process. So I like hiring out of your network. I just think you want the officialness of it because as you said otherwise you don’t exactly know what you’re getting and maybe you’re doing the candidate a disservice a bit.  Colleen Schnettler:Well, I totally agree. Well, hopefully I’ll be hiring again someday, and I will go through, I mean, if I’m hiring someone in my network, I’m not going to go through interviewing 35 people or whatever, but I will go through the process of a proper job description, proper expectations of engagement, coding, challenge, the whole thing, because I think you’re right. Even when you hire in your network, it’s good to go through that entire process so everyone knows what’s going on.  Rob Walling:So with hiring comes managing, you’re managing a team. Have you managed a team of developers before? What’s that like for you?  Colleen Schnettler:I have not. And it’s been interesting because I’m a very likable person, people like me, and I guess I thought that would magically translate into being a good manager, and spoiler alert, it does not. Yeah, I have really struggled with figuring out how to manage people, what the right cadence is.  Rob Walling:I find that being nice. I consider myself similar. I’m a very likable person. I’m amicable. I had to get over the fact. I started managing, I’m trying to think. I was probably 29 ish years old, which is for me was young. I took me a while to mature. I was too nice. I didn’t know how to give negative feedback. I feared giving negative feedback. That is something for people who are pretty amicable and get along with everybody to get in a meeting like this and say, I love working with you, but you drop the ball on this, or I need you to do better in this area. Let me help you. It somehow feels like you’re being mean. I think we’re trained not to say bad things about people. I think we’re trained not to tell people they’re not doing a good job, and yet that’s what you have to do as a manager. And that’s one thing that I have as I’ve hired people who haven’t managed, and I mentor them into being managers. This is what I tell them is, you’re going to build great rapport with the folks who work from you. They’re going to, you figure out a way to help them improve, to help them get better, and in order to help them get better, you have to point things out that they’re not doing at the top of their game.  Colleen Schnettler:That is a hundred percent my problem. I worked back in the pre 15 years ago, I worked at a Fortune 500 company, and it was the kind of company that had meetings just to plan the next meetings. So I came out of that experience being like, we don’t do anything at this company except have meetings. So I am never having meetings. There will be no meetings. Well, here I am wanting to have meetings with my developers. So yeah, it’s a super learning process. I am trying to figure it out.  Rob Walling:So speaking of meetings and how much, I hate meetings as well, I never liked one-on-one meetings. So when I was a developer, we do these one-on-ones with your boss or your supervisor, and I was always like, this is such a bold, can you leave me alone so I can go write I code to write? I don’t want to talk to you about my feelings. And then I had a team of 10 and I was doing no one-on-ones, and I realized, oh, no one’s going to just come and tell me when there’s a grievance or when they feel bad, they’re not going to initiate a lot, especially introverted developers don’t want to rock the boat, don’t want to, whatever. For whatever reason, they don’t have the opportunity for it. And I realized I have to do one-on-ones. And so if you have senior people, I do monthly one-on-ones. If you have mid-level, usually it’s every two weeks, whatever the cadence, but that one-on-one then is the time every two weeks or every month for them to talk about their performance, for them to talk about, to make sure that you’re guiding them well, and then for you to talk about their performance and to compliment them like, you did an amazing job here, here, and here. And then to say, Hey, so we shift a bug to production that broke our trial flow. Obviously we need more process to not do that, but talk to me about how that happened. Let’s talk it through. The idea behind them is that it forces you to do it, otherwise you’re never going to do it. You’re not going to think, wake up today and think, man, I should really talk to so-and-so about how they’re dropping the ball. It’s like, I don’t want to do that. How are you thinking about getting better as a manager? Do you have any friends, mentors? Do you have any books that you plan to read?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, I am challenging myself to be more, I dunno if assertive is the right word, but as you described, to be more honest, I was socialized or whatever. I am bad at giving negative feedback. It’s funny because I’m always kind of tiptoeing around the issue, and my co-founder is actually great at emotional intelligence. And so Aaron, and I’ll be on the call and he’ll say this thing to me where he’s like, what’s the subtext you’re not saying? And that always makes you be like, oh, what is the thing that I’m not saying? I don’t want to hurt your feelings. And so I’m trying. But honestly, I don’t really know. I mean, I’m just trying to be better. We weren’t having regular check-ins. Now that I have this team of three, I’m trying to do regular check-ins with everyone and give them an opportunity to speak, but also be more assertive, like I said, in terms of being like, Hey, you’ve got to hit this deadline. If you’re not going to hit this deadline, I need to know before the day of the deadline. We’ve got to communicate in such a way that I share my expectations with you and you give me feedback on whether or not those expectations can be met. And I do read a lot of books, so I just read Never Split the Difference, which is technically a negotiating book, but just felt kind of like a communications book. So I’m trying to take some of those tactics into place when speaking to my team. It’s hard too, because if you think of the success of a business, the success of a business, I think you’d know better. But it depends on your team. I was reading a bunch of stuff from the Netflix guy, and he talked about how he goes in and fires all the B players, because if you want to build something excellent, you need a team of excellent people that can work together. But also, it’s hard coming in from a tech side like, ah, managing’s not that important. How hard can it be? Do I really need to learn how to do this? So it’s kind of an interesting juxtaposition between being a technical person trying to run a business and appreciating the importance of a good team. And one of the things I was doing in the early days of a team was I was so worried everyone was going to quit Because good developers are hard to find and hard to retain. And so instead of unifying people behind a shared vision, I was trying to let everyone do whatever they wanted so they wouldn’t quit. I wasn’t a real fear. No one quit, but it’s just you have all this stuff, these subconscious thoughts about how do I keep these people happy? So they enjoy working here. So they have that intrinsic motivation while also telling them when they’re not performing up to standards.  Rob Walling:That is it. That’s the difficult balance. The interesting thing is you don’t need to be a good manager in the near term. You can hire people, you’ll do fine for six months, you’ll be fine for a year, but in the long term, if you want to grow this larger, you will start to lose people if things are poorly managed, frankly, especially as the team gets bigger and especially the longer people stick around, they just get tired of it. As we wrap up, what’s the one thing you’re most looking forward to between now and the next time we chat?  Colleen Schnettler:I am super excited about this whole reporting MVP pivot. Like Aaron has all these cool ideas about what it’s going to look like, and by the time I talk to you next, we should have this. I mean, it won’t be done done, but we will have a solid functional MVP that we can start really picking up and showing to potential customers. So that is definitely what I’m most excited about.  Rob Walling:Love it. That’s awesome. That’s the next milestone. I’m excited for you too. Thanks. I am excited to see where Colleen, Aaron and Hammer Stone are. The next time we talk, we’ll learn more about their progress on the reporting MVP pivot.

In this episode, I have a Laura Rotor founder of Paper Bell. Join me on the show to answer listener questions. We talk about making your first hire, testing prices, and a bunch of other questions related to mid to later stage bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. Before we dive in to today’s questions, wanted to let you know about something that my team and I at TinySeed have been working on for at least six months in the background. And it’s a premium private coaching community designed for B2B SaaS founders making at least 1 million in a RR or more. It’s called the SaaS Institute. And if you want to find out more, head to SaaS institute.com, enter your email address. We’ll be trickling out more information in the coming weeks and over the next few months, we are keeping the initial group very small. So if you’re interested in applying to potentially be part of the first cohort to get expert coaching, mentorship and community for high level SaaS founders, head to SaaS institute.com. If you’ve been watching what we’ve done with TinySeed over the past five or six years and thought to yourself, I could really use some community and mentorship and advice, but I don’t necessarily want to raise funding and or give up equity. That’s why we’re launching the SaaS Institute. And with that, let’s dive into listener questions with Laura Rotor. Laura Rotor, thanks for joining me on Startups For the Rest Of Us.  Laura Roeder:Yes, for the third time apparently fourth time.  Rob Walling:The  Laura Roeder:Fourth time,  Rob Walling:Yeah, so back in 2013, episode 1 43, how to hire like a Bootstrapper with special Guest Laura Rotor. And then two episodes in 2019 where I interviewed you about it must’ve been Edgar.  Laura Roeder:Yeah,  Rob Walling:It was about Edgar, it’s seller growth platform risk layoffs and powering through roadblocks. That sounds like the summary. That  Laura Roeder:Sounds like Edgar. All the  Rob Walling:Things. All the things. And then you sold Edgar in 22, I believe, right? A couple years ago.  Laura Roeder:Yeah.  Rob Walling:You have a good blog post about, that’ll link up in the show notes. And then December of 2019 you came on to answer listener questions. So today you are working on Paper Bell. Is that paper bell.com? Do you have the.com?  Laura Roeder:Yes.  Rob Walling:Very nice. You want to tell folks what it is, how long, the history of that, how long have you been working on it?  Laura Roeder:Yeah, so Paper Bell is a bootstrap sauce that’s been around for four years. We’re in the seven figure annual reoccurring revenue range and it’s a tool for coaches like life coaches to run their business. So it has their website, their scheduling, their payments, client comms, all that stuff.  Rob Walling:And how big is your team?  Laura Roeder:Very small. So we operate on all mostly freelancers and part-timers. So we basically have two developers, two customer service people. I have a project manager that works with me in marketing and freelancers.  Rob Walling:Very nice. So you have a lot of experience across the board, bootstrapping, hiring, all the things. We have some good questions for you and I to bat around today. First one is from Ryan King and Ryan says, Hey Rob, thanks for your advice on selling my company at the end of 2022. The sale didn’t happen in the end, but I found my feet and I’m working on trying to grow again. I have an intermediate startup question for you. I’m trying to transition from a one person company where I do everything to having a team. Your book, I think it means a SaaS playbook, explores the idea of who should be your first hire, but I’m interested in that in-between phase where you have some excess profit but not enough to make a full-time hire. My SaaS produces an excess of about $2,000 a month. At the moment, it’s not much, but I’ve been trying to use it to hire freelancers to work on the project, expecting it to buy me time to work more on marketing and sales. But it’s been a very frustrating experience and I’m not sure I can find someone reliable at that price point. I’m looking to try something new and I’m interested in hearing how you would utilize a small amount of funds to help grow the company if you were in a similar situation. Well, Laura, I think both you and I have been in this situation, so what’s your advice for Ryan?  Laura Roeder:Customer service is just the first thing that instantly comes to mind for most businesses. Customer service is either takes up a lot of time or even if it doesn’t take up a ton of time, it’s a constant distraction, which I don’t know Ryan’s business, but the fact that he’s not immediately running to customer service makes me wonder if he has one of those businesses that doesn’t have a huge support load. So maybe he’s thinking, ah, I don’t have to do that much customer service. It’s no big deal. But the problem with customer service is that it’s 24 7 and if you are a solo founder, you’re usually kind of having it on in the background all the time is kind of how I’ve seen most people operate. So you can get a customer service person or full-time depending on where in the world. For 2000 for sure. Obviously you can scale up the pay and scale down the time. You can get someone more experienced and have them in less hours. So that’s just kind of my immediate thing that for most businesses would save them a lot of time. The other one that I would think to look to is just kind of a general virtual assistant can be a really, really good hire at this stage. Lots of great people for around 10 to 15 an hour USD. You can find someone really good who knows what they’re doing from various parts of the world. And yeah, maybe they’re helping with stuff like customer service, maybe they’re helping with, it’s just kind of the admin grunt work stuff. It could be marketing stuff, customer service stuff. It could be techier stuff that’s more just grunt work instead of requiring deep knowledge. There’s usually a lot of that that can be taken off a founder’s plate.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that. The virtual assistant thing, if you want to read more about that, buy Back Your Time by Dan Martel I think was a really good book talking about how to think through that. Where do you hire? Are you an Upwork person? Where would you look for someone like this?  Laura Roeder:Yeah, good question. So I have a virtual assistant type of person. I have found before on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. If you look for the more expensive people on those platforms, especially Fiverr, if you’re looking at the most expensive person on Fiverr, that can be a good way to do it. And especially if you have some kind of specialty that you’re starting with. Let’s say you do a lot of video editing. You’re like, okay, I’m going to look for someone who has that skill listed on those sites and then they can do other VA stuff. For me, for customer service, I would probably look more towards, a lot of it is regional. So if you’re looking in the Philippines online jobs.ph, like oldie, but a goodie still kicking  Rob Walling:Back in the day. Yep.  Laura Roeder:Yeah, it’s still around. There’s a site called Job Rack that’s really good for Eastern Europe. Obviously there’s tons of those now services that will hire for you and do the placement, but you’re usually paying a huge fee to them. So if you only have 2000 a month, you’ll probably be better off spending your time to source the person directly.  Rob Walling:If I’m doing a full-time W2 employee hire, we go through Dynamite Jobs, remote first recruiting just because finding full-time people is so time consuming, but if we’re hiring, we tend being TinySeed and even Drip. Back in the day we tended to go to Upwork and just we had a process, so we filter ruthlessly and we have a pretty good hit rate. It depends on the role, but we’ve had to hire a lot of part-timers, freelancers in the past few years and I think that’s the big, probably my advice for Ryan Echoes yours, customer support, customer success. Well, customer, if you have a low touch funnel where everyone’s just self sign up, I think it’s customer support, it’s email and live chat usually if you have a higher touch funnel, I think a VA or an EA or even customer success for onboarding, if that’s taken a lot of your time, obviously you have to hire part-time at two grand a month, but I’ve done this over and over and over. I’ve hired a lot of part-time people and eventually if they’re good I just move ’em to full-time. I hired a book project manager, which I think of the specialization of that role when I was launching the SaaS playbook of there’s so many specialized things you need to know. And I went on Upwork and I said, project manager bonus if you have experience in the publishing industry, and I happen to find someone in South America, she’s amazing. And she totally rocked the launch of SaaS Playbook and then Sherry hired her as her chief of staff, so she now works full-time for Sherry. You know what I mean? It’s just these things, if you find good people, you keep ’em around. The editor of this podcast, I believe has been editing it for 10 years. Andy who did email and live chat support for us at Drip worked the full, he probably worked there. He started as a part-timer doing five, 10 hours a week. He was through the whole and was with Drip for six, seven years. Then he worked for squad cast, a TinySeed company for five or six years and now he’s working for another TinySeed company. It’s like they stay in there because he’s so amazing. He’s so good. Anytime I’m like, if you look for a job, reach out to me. I want to place you with a company that I trust. So I think that’s part of it too, is your first freelance hire is always like, Ooh, you don’t have the experience and you don’t have any type of network. But once you start finding good freelancers, it’s almost like keep ’em in your orbit because you may need ’em over your career.  Laura Roeder:And I found when you’re looking on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, my tip would be to pay a bit more, do not look for the lowest hourly cost.  Rob Walling:Oh, for sure.  Laura Roeder:I have a guy I’m working with through Upwork right now that’s doing, we use Divvy on WordPress, so we kind of needed someone who’s familiar with that system and he’s in Pakistan and he charges 15 an hour. So there’s people in Pakistan who charge four an hour and I’m like, I want the 15 guy. So I think just doing that, if you have 2000, it’s like, yeah, you have some hours at 15 an hour, so don’t feel like you have to just absolutely scrounge and do just the absolutely cheapest person you can find. I found it’s well worth it to work with people that are still very affordable from A USD perspective, but not that bargain basement rate.  Rob Walling:Yeah, totally. The other thing that I look for too when I’m hiring someone like this is usually it’s for a focused task or role, like we’ve said, customers service. But once I get to know if they’re good, I’ll say, Hey, what else do you do? What else do you dabble in? And you’ll often find it’s like, well, I do web design on the side, or I used to be a help desk person so I know what FTP is and basic computer troubleshoot. And you just kind of find out what else they know and you can start passing other things off to them that are hopefully within their comfort zone. I don’t look for a unicorn of like, I need a customer support slash marketer slash developer. It’s like, come on, that doesn’t exist except for Derek Rimer. But realistically, if you find someone good, they usually are good at other things too. And if you are a limited team, you don’t want to hire someone for each role if you can possibly have someone serve as two. So thanks for that question, Ryan. I hope it was helpful. My next question comes from Mark Krug. He’s the founder of Beta List and Startup jobs and wp.co. And this question comes to us from Twitter X, Twitter. I actually asked this question back in June. I said, what are some more advanced, intermediate and advanced questions? And he responded with, how can I do price discovery for a product where customers know what the others are paying? In my case, it’s a community product, but the same applies to certain markets. And I made a clarification. I said to clarify, do you mean how to raise lower test pricing when new customers know what your existing customers are paying? And he said, yes, specifically how to test different pricing models once you already have a customer base. Laura Rotor, have you tested pricing?  Laura Roeder:I have. And I will say people always say, oh, just test your price. And it’s definitely not that easy for lots of reasons, right? I’ve definitely been in that position where we have now 40 different things in Stripe because we followed the advice to test our, and now our tracking’s almost up and we have a million edge cases. It’s never as easy as people make it sound. And he’s bringing up a common concern in price testing, which is like, oh, my customers are going to see that someone else is paying a lower price. Now, I will say that’s usually less of a concern than you think it is. This person mentioned they have a community that their customers are active in. So even in that situation, let’s say you have a really active discord that all your customers are on, they’re not spending their time on your pricing page usually because already customers, but sometimes you get, it can happen where you get the one person and they’re like, Hey everybody, did you know that this company now is, we paid 50 and it’s just 40. But if you have that type of community, you’re usually very tightly involved with it as the founder and just be transparent. It’s like, yeah, we’re running a business. This is a test that we’re doing. If it rolls out, we’ll see if we might change pricing for existing customers as well. I think don’t announce it, don’t go into your community and be like, Hey everybody, we’re going to test out a lower price. But it’s very, very rare that you will get any kind of backlash from existing customers. And if it’s one-on-one, we’ll just offer it. So if we’re running some sort of promotion and one of our existing customers sees it, we’ll either offer them that promotion just in an email or we’ll be like, oh, we can give you this. That was just for new customers, but we’ll give you this other discount instead. Something like that. You can just handle it on a case by case one-on-one basis.  Rob Walling:I echo all of that. I have tested in quotes because the only company only SaaS company I ever have seen that actually split tested pricing was Zapier. And I’m sure someone else has done it, my HubSpot maybe. I mean there’s a few, but as a rule, you don’t test pricing. You take your best guess and you make the switch and then you roll it back if it doesn’t work. And I have had to do that and it’s not great, but you don’t even mess with existing customers at that point. You just change the pricing page and you say, fingers crossed that this is going to work, and you stare longingly at your numbers for the next seven to 14 days and you’re like, gritting your teeth. Did I just ruin my whole funnel? Terrifying. And if it works, you’re like, okay, now let’s talk about grandfathering versus not. Do we raise on existing? Let’s give it a couple months to iron out. Let’s look at our churn. That’s type of thing. And if it doesn’t work and early on, then yeah, you roll it back. That’s the only testing that I’ve ever done. So from the time we started Drip until we sold it, I think it was three and a half years and we three or four different versions of our pricing, I remember there was the V one billing engine and then the V two, V three V four, and one of them switched the pricing model, so it switched from new subscribers per month. We originally, that was our value metric, and then we switched to just subscribers in your account per month once we became an ESP. And then after that, the next two I think were just increasing prices basically. Or it was reducing the number of subscribers, keeping the price points the same, so effectively increasing pricing. And I do remember being nervous each time we did it. I viewed them as a test, but we just did it. And I think pricing, there’s so much to gut feel, and this is where hard decisions with incomplete information. I mean, I know that Patrick Campbell at ProfitWell talks about if you’ve ever seen him do a talk on pricing, it’s like, and we do this survey and you get these lines that  Laura Roeder:I’m very skeptical.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I’ve never done, I’ve never known anyone to do that except for ProfitWell. And they’re like pricing consultants, everyone else. I know it’s gut feel. It’s knowing your customer. It’s knowing the competitive landscape and it’s being like, well, am I losing some of my, if you’re doing enterprise sales or even just high touch sales, am I getting 10 to 20% that are complaining about my price good, then I’m probably priced accurately. If no one’s complaining about my price, I’m probably underpriced. And if people are saying, oh, you’re so cheap, or I’m way less than competitors, I’m probably underpriced. So  Laura Roeder:Yeah, I think he was asking about testing different pricing models. And it brings up one of just the hard things about being a bootstrap business is you don’t have enough volume to test something like pricing model. Your pricing model usually means a completely different backend, right? Testing something usage versus flat rate plans. There’s a huge amount of technical work involved. And for you to be able to maintain both those versions and then actually test ’em against each other, you’re just not going to have to have enough volume to do that. And you don’t have enough volume to test a lot of things. I mean, most things as a bootstrap company. So I think it is really important that you don’t approach this thinking, oh, I have no idea what’s going to work. So we’ll just test different things and we’ll see. You really have to go in with a strong hypothesis of this makes sense. This is what the industry is telling me, this is what customers are telling me. If you have strong evidence that something else makes more sense, sometimes we make the wrong choice. Sometimes we start one way and it becomes apparent like, oh shit, we really should be a usage based company. Then sometimes it makes sense to make that hard switch, but Rob’s saying it really can’t be a test. It needs to be more a pivot to that direction and then throw it all back if you absolutely have to.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And before I’ve changed pricing, usually it starts to just feel wrong in my gut of something’s off, what’s off, and then I start noodling in a notebook and then I talk to my co-founder, and then I’ve talked to folks in my mastermind. And these days I would probably go to Patrick Campbell, or he’s busy these days, but marco@pricing.io, pricing io.com. There’s certain folks that I would go to for some advice, and I do think it’s not like, what should I do? But it’s like, Hey, I have these two or three different ideas and I have a leaning, what do you think? And then the person would ask me questions of like, well, I don’t know your competitive landscape. How are your competitors priced? And that’s the kind of stuff with TinySeed companies that I do all the time. The majority of my calls with them are around some type of strategic decision, a pivot or something. And pricing is a big one, and there are rules of thumb.  Laura Roeder:So if you’re not in TinySeed, just chat with ai.  Rob Walling:Chat with ai. Yeah, say pretend you’re Rob Walling, you can do that now and chat GPT. There you go. And it’s like, okay,  Laura Roeder:Patrick Campbell. Yeah,  Rob Walling:What’s wrong with, yeah, what’s wrong with my pricing? This is my pricing page. Tell me what’s wrong. Yeah, changing the value metric is a big one. Simplifying. I mean, we do pricing tear downs at the kickoffs for TinySeed, and one of the biggest repeated things we see is too much. There’s too many value. You don’t need three value metrics usually is like, try, let’s try. Why do we have that one? Oh, that’s because a competitor. Nope. Get rid of it. Just make it either unlimited or within reason, within terms of service. Let’s get down to the one thing that really provides the value. So thanks for that question Mark. Hope it was helpful. Our next question is from Daniel Tanner and he asks content, what type of content should you be doing and how do you decide if it’s working? Laura, a tiny small question. What type of content  Laura Roeder:I have answer? I have an answer. The content you should be doing first is definitely the content that’s closest to your sale. So what they call bottom of the funnel content. The first thing you want to do with your content is have content for people who are actively looking to buy your thing. When people are typing in, I need a podcast hosting tool, you want content letting people know that you are a podcast hosting tool, let you do all the things. So this sounds kind of basic, but that is actually I think the best place to start with your content, making sure that you’re covering, of course, you said the word content. I don’t really know if you mean are these videos, are these blog posts? Are these LinkedIn updates? But whatever it is, you have to make sure it’s really clear that people know which problems that your tool solve. I mean, this could be support docs, right? It’s like you need stuff on the internet that answers people’s questions and tells them what your tool does. How do you know if it’s working? That’s a much harder question. How do you know if it’s working? I think something that’s really tricky about looking at content and broad strokes is we kind of like to do things, look at which content converts. This is something that we will look at on my team. We’re like, oh, which blog posts lead to a free trial signup or an opt-in signup? And I think it’s a little bit of a BSE kind of metric because it’s like, well, is it really that blog post that caused them to convert or is that the blog post they happen to be reading right before they convert. So I would actually advise that you not get too deep in the weeds of trying to pinpoint, oh, this specific piece of content caused this action, but it might be more if you are talking about video LinkedIn blog. Yeah, of course you’re looking at are those driving traffic for us? How are those performing? But to look at it in a more sort of broad strokes, holistic type of way.  Rob Walling:Yeah. I’ll start with the attribution. How do you know if it’s working? You do your best. You do the best you can is what it is. And there’s different types of attribution. There’s like first touch, well, how did you first hear about us? There’s last touch. Well, that caused them to convert, which is what you were saying. And then there’s this blended attribution of we’ve had six touch points with them, so each of them gets 15% of the conversion. You’ve seen this in Google Analytics.  Laura Roeder:Oh yeah.  Rob Walling:And I never used, I would look at First Touch and Last Touch only are the only things I ever looked at. And you do the best you can. Attribution is not as good as it was five or 10 years ago, and it’s probably not going to be as good five or 10 years from now because of privacy and because of Google wanting to sell more ads. So we don’t get keywords provided to us anymore as we did back in the Halon days of SEO. But realistically, even if attribution is only 70% good, 60% accurate, at least it’s something, at least you have some data. The other thing I like to look at is having a, how did you hear about us when people get in the app? Is that foolproof? Of course, not every time we do this with TinySeed applications because I like to see what’s actually driving applicants. And then I can even look at, ooh, these were our 30 best applicants based on our ratings, what drove those the best applicants? And it’s super helpful for us, but inevitably we get people saying, oh, your email list. And it’s like, that’s not helpful to me. How did you get on the email list?  Laura Roeder:They’re like, I went to your website.  Rob Walling:It’s like, great, but how did you find the website? So it’s not perfect, but it’s better than nothing. That is how I know it’s working. And usually, I mean, I’ll tell you, if you truly are doing an SEO and creating a lot of content, whether that’s written content or videos or tools, I think of building a tool like Ruben does, the free tools, usually it is like 80 20 or even worse. It’s like 95, 5 or 5% of your content catches, and that drives a lot of traffic and well, a lot of conversions, at least in my experience. The other thing to think about is you said what is content? Because I think of it in two buckets, right? There’s onsite, which is like I’m going to create stuff on my website usually to try to draw search engine traffic or to point people to from social media. So I go out it’s hub and spoke. The hub is my website. I want people to get there. I want ’em to convert to the email list or convert to a trial. And the spokes are Twitter, Instagram, maybe even YouTube videos, a podcast and whatever, social media. So all of that is content, and that’s why this is a complicated question, is onsite. You totally answered that of look at the five stages of awareness. You can just Google that. I also did a, there’s a talk on YouTube. It’s something like, this is the best content marketing strategy I’ve ever seen. It’s on the Microcom channel. It’s a talk I gave, and I talk about creating content from unaware to problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware. And you started this answer by saying, start with product aware and most aware, which is exactly what I say in that talk, and then work your way up. So onsite. I think that’s correct, offsite. Should I go on Pinterest? Should MicroConf and TinySeed be marketing on TikTok? No, because our people aren’t there and they’re not being, but our  Laura Roeder:People are on Pinterest. We direct traffic from Pinterest. Yeah,  Rob Walling:Exactly. So then the question is, should you be creating Pinterest? Well, of course, because where your customers are. So that’s the question I would throw back to Daniel, is figure out where your customer, are they on X Twitter? Are they on Instagram? Are they on YouTube? That’s how I think about it.  Laura Roeder:And I would say keep it obvious. I think people often overthink this and over this, our customers are on Instagram is the main place because Instagram has a massive user base. Don’t try to get cute and clever with these little niche. I mean, sometimes there’s a niche community that’s super relevant to you. If you’re only for Ruby on Rails developers, be on those forums and lists and whatever, but don’t mark it on Blue Sky. It just launched. Hang out there for fun. If you want to mark it on LinkedIn, on Instagram, on Reddit, if that’s where people are, YouTube, lots of people on YouTube. Just don’t overthink it. Go for the most obvious ones where your customers obviously are.  Rob Walling:The biggest ones are usually the ones where there are the most people by definition. So I was skeptical two or three years ago. We were talking, what’s the next thing we’re going to attack for MicroConf audience building. We have the podcast, it grows, it grows really slow as podcast do. And I was like, YouTube, I think it’s going to be a bunch of 20 year olds. I see my 18-year-old just sipping through Minecraft videos and I was pretty skeptical. But then we did see other channels. Dan Martel had a channel and a few others that were talking about SaaS and had some reach. And so we were convinced of that. We were deciding between YouTube and TikTok at the time, and I went on TikTok and I was like, no, no, no. I don’t know that TikTok will ever, ever be for MicroConf TinySeed, but YouTube turned out to be really good. So thanks for that question, Daniel. I hope it was helpful. Next question is from Noel Gomez. He is a TinySeed founder. He asked on Twitter, given limited time and resources, Hey, that’s bootstrapping. How do you prioritize where to focus and invest to grow your pipeline? So specifically to generate new leads? How do you do it, Laura?  Laura Roeder:Yeah, this one is interesting. He uses the word pipeline. So this makes me think it’s a sales situation.  Rob Walling:Enterprise sales, he has a really big, big ticket.  Laura Roeder:So I mean the obvious one is just LinkedIn. I mean, that’s where the vast majority of people are doing it. I know LinkedIn are the big thing right now that are apparently getting a lot of eyeballs and a lot of awareness. So we talked about being on the biggest platforms, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, depending on where your people are. And then I think if you’re kind of breaking down those platforms, you want to do what the platform wants you to do. And so usually they will have these new things that they’ll give a lot of visibility to. Newsletters are a new product from LinkedIn, so they are giving a lot of visibility to newsletters. The reason so many people are succeeding on LinkedIn right now in general is because LinkedIn’s trying to get more active users hanging out on LinkedIn. So they’re actually showing people what you post in the feed. Like 15 years ago, you could post things on a Facebook page and that would show in people’s feed because they were promoting that, but that time is long gone. So it’s kind of a tricky balance. It’s like you want to be on the mainstream trends. You don’t want to be on something before. No one else is there yet, but if it’s a big platform, it is good to be on whatever that platform is pushing, which is why on Instagram and TikTok, people are often jumping around between stories and reels and whatever the latest thing is, but it actually kind of does make sense to be on whatever the latest thing is because you want to be buddies with, don’t go against Instagram, do whatever Instagram wants you to do.  Rob Walling:And I think the overarching thing that I think about is as a bootstrapper with limited time and resources, I would make a list of all of the marketing approaches that I wanted to try, and then I would pick the one I thought was going to work and I would work on it and focus the thing. I think if you try to do content, SEO, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, try to do all these things, you’re just not good at any of them and you don’t learn how to do them well. You’re just throwing stuff into the ether. Even with MicroConf TinySeed where we have budget and we have a team, we pick one new thing to attack, and we did YouTube for two and a half years and then until it plateaued around 90,000. And then we are looking at LinkedIn next and we’re going all in. We hired a LinkedIn consultant. We are spending thousands of dollars a month, many thousands to edit video and to create carousels and to do this stuff and to do, there is a LinkedIn playbook and kind of all the LinkedIn consultants say the same thing. This is what’s working right now. So that’s what we are going to do in the new year. For us. Audience building is a thing. What Microcom and 10 C Thrive on, it’s built around the audience. If you’re doing enterprise sales, I don’t think you should build an audience at all. It should be all about it’s selling. I think of the big, I call ’em the big five marketing approaches, which is the ones that B2B SaaS companies, especially Bootstrappers use the most, which is like content, SEO, cold outreach in-person events. Number six, actually pay-per-click and integrations and partnerships and then in-person events is in there as well. All of those depend on your annual contract value. Are you high touch or low touch, right? So with Paper Bell, you would never do, I shouldn’t say never do in-person events, but it would be a stretch. Your A CV is too low. It would have to be a really a big event with a lot of people for you to be like, I’m going to make this five grand back in signups. Versus Noel, since he’s a tint company, I know that they could literally get one customer from an in-person event and it would totally pay back whatever sponsorship they paid. So that’s how I do it is I take a guess and usually I want to do one that’s slow and one that’s fast, meaning s content and SEO is usually slow. It’s going to take months and months and months to pay off. And so what’s the fast thing I can do? What’s the thing I can do to get a new customer tomorrow? It’s like cold outreach. Either AdWords or Facebook are the two big ones, or Capterra, Capterra G two. So it’s like, can I run some ads and spend some money, a high A CV and also be doing content SEO, or am I gifted on the microphone and there’s a bunch of podcasts and YouTube channels in my space? Do I want to go on a podcast tour or a YouTube tour and try to get on all those things? Maybe in your space there is, and maybe it isn’t. If it’s enterprise sales, it might not be, but that’s always the question is how do people market and sell in your space? How can you do it well? Where are your customers and how do you find them is really the fundamental way I think about it.  Laura Roeder:The other thing that comes to mind is the book Ultimate Sales Machine by Chet Holmes. I think it’s called the Dream 500  Rob Walling:Dream 100,  Laura Roeder:100. I  Rob Walling:Memorize that whole chapter,  Laura Roeder:And it’s just like, what would be your best a hundred customers? Write ’em down and call ’em. And it’s like, oh yeah, that is the most, and it’s like you’re saying, I do see a lot of founders that should be doing one-on-one sales trying to do more broader marketing stuff because it’s more comfortable. For a lot of people, they would rather be a guest on a podcast than they would go walk the floor of a sales convention and talk to a bunch of people, but the podcast is not going to get them customers. And the convention is, so the beautiful thing about the Dream 100 is it just cuts straight to the point. It’s like, who are your best customers? Have you call those people?  Rob Walling:And what I like about that book, if you’re listening to this and haven’t read the Ultimate Sales Machine, that chapter specifically talking about the Dream 100, it’s like make the list. And of course this is for selling. I think it’s selling stuff that’s like hundreds of thousands or millions a year. It’s really high ticket sales. So maybe for you it is Dream 500, but it’s make the list and then you call them and then you follow up, send them something in the mail. And these days, then you’d ping them on LinkedIn and then you’d send ’em an email and then you’d send them a physical thing. Do you remember this? It’s Lumpy Mail. It’s a lumpy mail where the physical object in an envelope, those don’t get thrown away. They open it up and they’re like, oh, it’s a tape measure that says, look how Data Coves helps you measure your result or whatever. It’s like a goofy cheesy thing. Data Coves is Noel’s startup. And so does this take time, attention, money, focus? It does. But if you’re selling big ticket items, this is how when you do run into that person at a conference, they’re like, I’ve heard of you guys. How have I heard of you? And it’s like, I’ve just been around. Retargeting is the other thing actually I want to throw in. If you are not doing retargeting, it is the cheapest advertising. And you can retarget what? You can do it on Facebook, you can do it on the Google network, and you can do it on YouTube. And a friend of mine had the YouTube tracking pixel, which I guess is just the Google tracking pixel and had this 32nd ad spot that was highly produced. And their customers or their prospects that they would talk to are, you guys are everywhere. You must be huge. You’re advertising all over YouTube. I see you all the time. And he was like, oh dude, we’re retargeting you. And so each of these takes time and money. Are you doing retargeting with Paper Bell?  Laura Roeder:Well, you know what I recently learned, this is kind of a new thing, is that on Meta, so if people listening haven’t used Meta Ads slightly, you don’t choose any targets anymore. You just do. The way that all the biggest spenders on Meta do It now is just to use Advantage, what they call Advantage Plus, which is just like Meta Do your thing. And what I recently learned is they also do retargeting automatically. So you actually, I mean you still can if you want to, but you no longer need to set up retargeting campaigns because obviously you have your website pixeled, and obviously those are smart people to show your ads to. So Meta just does it for you now. So we do.  Rob Walling:That’s interesting, man, how far this all has come. I remember spending so much time to figure out retargeting on the, and is it do on Google? And then is it working on Facebook? And then yeah, I feel like this question is like, how do you grow your pipeline? We could do an entire course on it. We could do an entire book on it. And a lot of the answer is, well, it depends on are your high touch or low touch? Where do your customers reside? I mean, I think these are the exercises that I would be going through. I would also, I like spying on competitors. Where are competitors running ads? What ads are they running? Go into HRES and say, what are they targeting with SEO? Can I do that better? Are they on Capterra? Are they doing integrations in partnerships? Who have they integrated with who’s promoted them? Each of these marketing approaches, I list 20 of them in the SaaS playbook. And you can go down and one by one Look, are competitors at events? Are they sponsoring events? It’s like asking that question. Now. I’m not saying just because they’re doing it, it’s working, but at least it should be on your radar that it’s a possibility in your space. So thank you for that question, Noelle. I hope that was helpful. Laura Rotor, thanks for joining me on the show.

Well, starting this week and for the next eight weeks, we’re going to have episodes of TinySeed Tales Season four in Your Feed every Thursday morning. If you’re not familiar with TinySeed Tales, it’s a narrative style season based show where I interview a founder as they try to find and optimize their product, finding product-market fit, scaling, finding escape velocity, et cetera. These nine episodes have been recorded over the past two years, so I want you to think about that. Entering into this adventure, you’re going to see a startup founder’s journey over two years, but you get to hear it in about nine weeks. The idea is to give you some insights into the ups and the downs, the struggles, the victories, and the failures of a real startup founder growing a real SaaS company that was bootstrapped until they took some money from TinySeed, so they’re still mostly bootstrapped in my parlance in season one of TinySeed Tales, I interviewed Craig Hewitt, the founder of Casto, who you’re probably familiar with at this point. He’s been a recurring guest on this show. In season two. It was Brian and Scotty, the husband and wife, pear founders of Gather, and season three was Tony Chan from Cloud Forecast. In this season, we’re following Colleen Schneller, founder of Hammer Stone Dev, which in the middle of the season, rebrands to Hello Query. It really is a wild ride. It’s a testament to the fight that it takes to make it down the hard road of starting a SaaS. If you’re not familiar with TinySeed, it’s the startup accelerator that I run for ambitious bootstrapped SaaS companies, the first accelerator of its kind. We run applications twice a year for folks who are bootstrapped and want the perfect amount of funding. A community of like-minded, ambitious, bootstrapped founders, advice, mentorship, and everything else you’d imagine would come from a world-class accelerator. Our next application period opens on February 10th and closes on February 23rd. Head over to tiny c.com/apply for more info. So with that, let’s dive into season four episode one of TinySeed Tails.  Colleen Schnettler:I was ready to go back to work and I wanted remote work. I didn’t know anybody who was doing this. It felt like this pipe dream, like this unobtainable pipe dream. There is a world where you can make six figures working from home, it seemed impossible.  Rob Walling:Welcome back to TinySeed Tales, a series where I follow a founder through their struggles, victories, and failures as they build their startup. I’m your host, Rob Walling, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of TinySeed, the first startup accelerator designed for Bootstrappers. Today we’re kicking off the first episode of season four of TinySeed Tails with developer and entrepreneur, Colleen Schneller.  Colleen Schnettler:My name Colleen Schettler and I am the co-founder of Hammer stone.dev.  Rob Walling:To give you context, hammer Stone is the name of the company, started by Colleen, a skilled Ruby on Rails developer and her co-founder Erin Francis, an expert in Laravel development. The idea behind Hammer Stone was to build a company that specializes in creating developer tools with small, easy to use components that simplify the process of building software. What sets this company apart is that while both Colleen and Aaron are technical co-founders, they each have different coding stacks. Something that becomes particularly relevant when discussing their flagship product Refine. Refine is sold as a single product that exists as a drop in Visual Query builder, but REFINE is actually two completely separate products due to the fact that they offer a version for Laravel and a version for Ruby on Rails. This relatively unique approach allows Hammer Stone to cater to a wider audience of developers. How did we get here where you have two separate products under the same name?  Colleen Schnettler:So this is kind of a good story. My co-founder, Aaron, he was working for a tax property company and they kept getting asked for custom reports and so he built out this custom component, this Laravel and View query builder and kept the IP in his contract and decided he was going to start selling it in the Laravel space and then a huge company in the rail space. So we’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars a year. A RR came in and said, we want this for Rails, and he’s not a Rails developer, so he hired me as a consultant. So I joined, I didn’t join him, I worked as a contractor for him for this big enterprise client. I did that for about eight months. I built out the product, then I thought our contract was over, so I went and got a full-time job and then two months after that, the original enterprise client said, no, we need full-time support on this product. And so I quit my full-time job after three months and became a full partner in Hammer Stone.  Rob Walling:That’s super interesting, not only the way that you were brought on as a consultant and are now a co-founder, but in the way that you’ve been able to keep the ip, both Aaron in his initial and then you with the Rails version, that’s atypical. How did that come about? Was it just we want to keep the ip, okay, here’s a contract or was there negotiation around that? Because I would imagine if I ran a company and I was hiring you to build something for me, I would tend to want to own that code if I was paying for it.  Colleen Schnettler:So this company was doing a complete rebuild, so the timing was excellent for us. They were doing a complete rebuild of their product and they’re also using a Ruby on Rails framework bullet train. That’s an open source framework. So their philosophy is keep their team lean and small. I mean, they have 50 engineers, so I don’t know that it’s that small, but keep their team lean and basically use off the shelf components for everything they can. And honestly, rabbi, I kind of think that they’re doing hundreds of millions of dollars in business. They don’t care if we do 5 million a year. They don’t care. It’s critical to their app, but it’s also kind of like a boilerplate thing that is not a distinguishing feature.  Rob Walling:I’m fascinated by the fact that Colleen’s enterprise client is disciplined enough to focus their attention on what they do best. It’s not often you see a company with that kind of mindset. Usually large companies try to make everything themselves believing that it’ll be faster or more cost-effective than buying an existing solution. In reality, that’s not usually the case. It takes months or in some cases years to develop software in-house and the results are often pretty mediocre, which is why this enterprise client’s approach is probably the right way to do it. It sounds like they’re focusing on their strengths. There’s another inspiring example in Colleen’s story about how she became what she likes to call an atypical founder. You’re a Rails developer.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes.  Rob Walling:Did you go to school to learn how to code?  Colleen Schnettler:I did not. I am a self-taught Rails developer.  Rob Walling:How’d you get into it?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, I was a stay-at-home mom. I had three kids under five or something, so I’m dripping with children and I wanted flexible remote work, and this is back in 2014 before covid. Before that was easy to find and honestly at the time I didn’t know anyone that had flexible remote work except this idea of software developers. And so that’s what I decided I wanted to do. So back in, gosh, 2011, I think I published an app to the iOS app store. That was my very first foray into software development and I made $60, but you have to pay a hundred dollars to be in the app store  Rob Walling:Net loss on your first product. That’s  Colleen Schnettler:Great. Net loss on my first product, and again, this was crazy time, my husband’s in the service, so he’s gone a lot. He deploys a lot. Little kids were, I was home with little kids, and so I thought, not everyone needs an iOS app, but everyone needs a website, so I am going to learn how to make websites and Rails was the hotness. Even though Rails maybe isn’t the hotness anymore, I still think it’s the right place to start. It’s a very descriptive framework. I don’t want to say it’s easy to learn. It’s not, but you can learn. There’s enough in there that you can learn following a lot of tutorials and publish stuff to the web. And so I just started doing that and then I worked for free. I mean, I did all the things they say you aren’t supposed to do. I worked for free for a year until eventually I got my first consulting job,  Rob Walling:Self-taught Rails developer and a military spouse with three kids at home. That’s almost the definition of an atypical founder, which is a term that you’ve discussed at length with your co-host on your podcast. Colleen’s path to building a startup is perhaps a bit non-traditional. Dig deeper into her story and find out what led her into tech.  Colleen Schnettler:Well, desperation breeds discipline. I think that, I mean wasn’t desperate. It’s not like we couldn’t put food on the table, but I was ready to go back to work and I wanted remote work, and that is what is so interesting to me too, is I didn’t know anybody. I didn’t know anybody who was doing this, so it seemed like I can still remember what it felt like. It felt like this pipe dream, like this unobtainable pipe dream. There is a world where you can make six figures working from home. It seemed impossible. And so for me it was a grind. I mean, I just would grind. I would listen to, I’d do the dishes and listen to the Code Newbie podcast, which was very popular at the time, excellent podcast. And then I’d work every night trying to teach myself Ruby on Rails from eight to 10:00 PM and I just did that for years. The thing that I would like to tell people is it’s not easy. I hate when you go on the internet, and I think we could probably make a lot of these same analogies with business building. You go on the internet and you read. If you Google Learn to code, you’ll see all these articles where people are like, oh, I spent four months and now I’m making $120,000 working from home, and that just doesn’t feel like reality for most of us. And so I kind of had to learn that, but I am the most persistent person on the face of the planet. But it was a grind. But one more thing I want to say about it. It was a grind, but it changed my life. I would do it again in a heartbeat, a hundred percent worth it.  Rob Walling:I feel the same way about software development. I’m also, I was a kid. I had the luxury of my parents were able to afford an Apple two E in the 1980s and I wrote code because we couldn’t afford to buy any games for it, and so it came with a book. I speak basic to my Apple and I learned basic programming, and then we started, I know it’s sad, but it’s a history. I was eight years old and it was the first code I ever wrote and it absolutely changed my life. The entire trajectory of what and what I’ve built today is based on that got me into tech. That is what got me into tech. After I graduated from college, I worked construction, but I had this coding knowledge from 15 years prior and all those nights and weekends of doing it then. And then I had to reteach everything because Basic didn’t do anything In the late nineties. So I went to the library and HTML and Pearl and basically had to teach myself how to do it again. I would say the same thing about entrepreneurship. I like and want to underscore what you said, which is the internet or social media somehow glorifies the easy path or that it’s easy, and maybe it’s someone trying to sell a course, maybe it’s someone trying to sell their point of view. It’s weird. It’s easy and it’s hard. I think I remember it being a lot of hard work and just a lot of hours, that 10,000 hours to get good at something. But I also remember thinking this is easier than my day job where I would literally sit next to a backhoe. I was with a shovel and in the mud and it would rain, and we were digging ditches to lay, to lay electrical cable next to a building that you couldn’t get things into. And I thought that sucks. That was actual hard work. This is a lot of hours, but it stimulates your mind and you see that there’s a light at the end of a tunnel of this could feasibly change the trajectory of my life. And it sounds like it did that for you, just learning to develop, and I think that being an entrepreneur is that next stage for you. You know what I mean? It’s the next thing that’s going to change your life in the same way  Colleen Schnettler:I do too. And this was always the end goal, but when you’re looking, again, when you’re so far from it, it was like, okay, first I’ve got to learn to code. I feel the same way. It’s kind of neat to have had that experience because before you have reached a goal, sometimes they can feel somewhat unobtainable. And so having already lived that once, I think you’re right. I think this for me a hundred percent, this is the next thing that’s going to change my life.  Rob Walling:I often use the phrase, think in terms of years, not months. As a founder, especially as someone who has bootstrapped or mostly bootstrapping a company, you’ve already done that. You’ve already been thinking in years. You started 2011, is that right?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes.  Rob Walling:Learning the code, which we’re recording this in 2023. So what a journey. How do you think being a military spouse impacted this journey? I imagine I’m making guesses. I’m not in the military, never had a family in the military. I’m imagining you moved a lot and you probably, as you were learning the code, did not have many peers around you as you said. So how does that shape your story?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, both of those things are true. I think the thing I said a little earlier about desperation, we move a lot. Before I had kids, I had had a job that I had to go into every day. It was an hour commute each way, eight hours come back, and military spouses are traditionally underemployed for this reason. When you’re moving a lot, it is hard to build a career. So the remote was so important to me. And there’s another thing that I think has influenced me. People look at me and they seem to be really worried that I’m going to burn out because I work a lot and I love what I do, but I have this context of being a military spouse. And let me tell you, Rob, nothing in the world is harder than single parenting. Three little kids. If I survive that I’ve kind of lived through. I just feel like my life experience, and also this is a little bit darker, but also true, we have friends that die. It happens. We went through a really hard period in 2013 to 2015 where there were a lot of bad things happening in the world, and we lost a couple really close friends. I feel like I have been through some really hard things when people complain about having to work too much or they’re worried that I’m going to burn out. I don’t know how to take care of myself. I’m like, that’s not accurate, because I’ve had these really challenging life experiences and I was in my twenties. I got married young. So I’ve had these really challenging life experiences that I think have kind of changed who I am and how I approach the world and how I approach life. And I think now at this point in my career, that’s going to help me get over the challenges of trying to start a business.  Rob Walling:Can you give us an idea of where Hammer stone slash REFINE stands today in terms of the progress that you’re making as a company?  Colleen Schnettler:Well, we’re very early, so we are kind of in that position right now where it’s kind of sort of working, but we don’t feel like we have landed on real product-market fit. So it feels like anything could happen, which is both exciting and terrifying.  Rob Walling:Absolutely. Essentially, you’re not at that point where this is a certainty and you’re still changing a lot about the business. Which brings me to my next question. Why join TinySeed?  Colleen Schnettler:It’s funny, joining TinySeed, you go to the retreat and meet the other TinySeed founders and they all say, we don’t need the money, and we joined TinySeed. We need the money. So I guess technically we didn’t need the money because this enterprise client is paying my salary as I develop for them, but the money is going to make a huge difference for us. It is going to enable me to free myself up as a consultant and work on the business. And the other reason is, it’s funny, Rob listening to this podcast years ago and you would talk about your mastermind, your secret mastermind, and this is before I knew anyone in this space, and I was like, how do I get in a secret mastermind? I want to be in the club. And so TinySeed is giving that to us. We’re in a mastermind. I have access to you. I mean, it’s really expanding our network. We have people who have reached out offered to help people offer to share contacts, and the more I get into this, the more I really think your network makes a tremendous difference, especially when you’re first trying to get off the ground.  Rob Walling:It absolutely does. That was a hard pill for me to swallow as I came up as an entrepreneur. And it sounds like for you as well, I’m working construction and I look around and I say, oh, it’s not what? It’s who. And that pissed me off. I felt like an outsider and and you just have to figure it out, and sometimes it’s a decade of grinding to figure that out or to build a network from scratch on your own and other times you can come alongside and join a network, which it sounds like what you’ve done with TinySeed is joining the network there. That already exists.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, and the thing about TinySeed two is the whole not crazy, not hustle, bro, has been very nice because again, military spouse, I have three kids, I’m still mostly the primary caregiver. So it’s not only a network, it’s a network of like-minded founders, and that’s really important  Rob Walling:At TinySeed. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive culture for all types of founders. So this comment really made me smile. I’m curious, over the past month or two, what has been a low point or something where you think back, this kind of sucks, this makes me think, do I really want to do this?  Colleen Schnettler:Yes. So our product, as I said, it’s a visual drop in query builder. When I say that, people don’t know what I’m talking about. So we have really struggled with positioning this product, and one of the ideas we had, we already have it made in Laravel, is Laravel has a admin panel that you can purchase that I guess everyone in the Laravel space uses. So we thought we’ll drop our price from a thousand dollars a year to $250 a year and sell it kind of as an add-on,  Rob Walling:Like a step one business. It’s a marketplace.  Colleen Schnettler:Exactly. So we announced it, we emailed our list the day before we dropped the price, someone bought the Laravel package for a thousand dollars. The next day we drop the price, one person buys it from our list, so now we have to refund the guy who spent a thousand dollars the difference, and we only have the one other sale. So we’re net negative on that, so that was not awesome. Those are fun.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Oh, that sucks. At least to look on the bright side of that. It does sting, but it’s a $500 issue. It’s a $500, whether it’s a mistake or just a $500 road bump, there are times when there are $50,000 road bumps. It’s probably less of the 500 and more about your aspiration for this to work. I mean, you wanted it to work. You wanted to sell five copies, 10 copies, whatever the number. You had a number in your head probably and it wasn’t one sale.  Colleen Schnettler:We are confused, I think as to, right, so basically let’s just say it was one sale because the other guy bought it at full price and we just don’t get it quite why people aren’t buying it. I mean, we don’t have a huge mailing list, but we got 500 people on our mailing list. All of those people at one point expressed an interest, so to have one sale feels just like, are we just totally wrong?  Rob Walling:Well, if I can pause it, I think price wasn’t the issue. Yeah, clearly price wasn’t the issue because dropping it by 75% sold one copy. It’s obvious people were not buying because it was expensive. Such a good lesson to learn.  Colleen Schnettler:Oh, it’s painful. But yeah, we thought price was the issue. And you’re right, clearly price is not the issue.  Rob Walling:How about a high point over the past month or two?  Colleen Schnettler:A high point. Okay, I like this. So we have been talking to product managers because we are repositioning, we think away from selling directly to developers and talking to product managers, and something that keeps coming up is custom reports for customers. So we’ve talked to analytics companies, we’ve talked to healthcare companies. They want their customers to be able to come in and get custom reports that they can save, that they can email to choose to email to themselves. Well, we’ve built out 85% of that. We’ve built out the hard work of that with this query builder. So to build the scaffolding around custom reports, which is literally just like an index view. You download the CSV and you set up a background job to send you an email once a week. We’ve done the hard part. So Aaron and I have been talking about kind of fleshing out the rest of that and providing custom reports for customers, and because we’ve done the hard part, he’s just kind of been hacking away on that this week, and he’s almost done 10 hours and we’re so close. So we think from these product manager conversations we’re going to lean into instead of visual query builder, whatever that means to custom reports.  Rob Walling:That’s amazing.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, we’re super excited. Not an admin dashboard, but it’s for your customers.  Rob Walling:I love it when that comes together because it rarely does, right? There’s always almost always a bunch of different signals and it’s muddy and it’s like, ooh, incomplete information, hard decisions. It sounds like this one’s pretty clear so far. It’s exciting.  Colleen Schnettler:Yeah, it feels clear. Now. I talked to some founders who talk to 15 customers a week, and we do not have that volume of customer interviews, so our sample size is smaller, but we do keep hearing it and every customer we have that we’ve talked to, I mean we just keep hearing it, so it feels like a really enticing kind of pivot, although it’s not really like a pivot. It’s kind of just like a gentle correction.  Rob Walling:Well, it’s an expansion of the software’s capabilities. You’re adding features, but then it all sounds like a repositioning in that you’re going to call it something different. Hey, those are the best when you can change an H one on your homepage and not have to, because a real pivot, it’s like well throw half the code base out and we’re doing a whole different thing. I mean, it depends on if there’s zoom ins and zoom outs and all that.  Colleen Schnettler:Yes, I would say that is what I’m most excited about. On the rail side, we are also responding to a lot of early customer feedback and building out essentially a V two of our product a lot. I mean, we’re going to do a lot this month. I’m hoping next time we talk, both of these things are done, and I am really excited to get over that hump because the current product, it’s an NVP running in an enterprise client’s application, so it’s a lot of work, I guess is the best way to say it. Like we’re making changes quickly, and so I think this kind of rewrite that we’re working on behind the scenes is going to make working with the products so much easier for the Rails customers.  Rob Walling:Given that we’re recording this in January of 2023, I find it so fitting that you are quoted by my producer in this document saying on software social, I have some big plans, big moves that are risky. 2023 is all about risk taking, and I feel like that’s the perfect way to end the first episode of this series is because this will almost follow a calendar year, and I know that I’m super interested to see how the year is going to pan  Colleen Schnettler:Out for you. Yeah, we’re super excited.  Rob Walling:I’m really excited to see Colleen and Hammer Stone are the next time we talk. It sounds like she and her co-founder have done a lot of reflecting and developed a healthy amount of self-awareness along their journey. Be sure to tune in next week to see how customer port and the overall repositioning of the product turnout. Plus, we’ll talk about other big moves that Colleen and Aaron plan on making with Hammer Stone in the coming year.","PublishedAt":"January 16, 2025","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-749-tinyseed-tales-s4e1-introducing-hammerstone-dev"},{"Title":"Episode 748 | The Ins and Outs of Startup Investing","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 748 | The Ins and Outs of Startup Investing\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:38:43\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 00:38:43 | Recorded on January 14, 2025\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 748, Rob Walling sits down with Einar Vollset, co-founder of TinySeed, to discuss the ins and outs of startup investing.

For the Rest Of Us, I’m Rob Walling, and in this episode I sit down with Einar Vollset, co-founder of TinySeed, and we take it in a little different direction than we normally do. Oftentimes when we talk about TinySeed, we will talk about things that we’ve learned investing across all these SaaS companies that could help you as a B2B SaaS founder, or maybe I’ll interview a TinySeed founder so we can take learnings and apply them to the broader community and the broader audience. But in this episode, Einar and I talked through something that he actually knew quite a bit about when we started TinySeed and I knew very, very little about, and that is startup investing and venture investing and why people would invest in a fund versus investing individually. We talk a little bit about the math of Venture and how and why TinySeed is so different, but we also talk about the fact that the venture industrial complex has really left behind thousands and thousands of startup founders, and that really was and still is the goal of TinySeed. As you know, my mission is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. TinySeed is part of that because no one else was serving that market when we stepped in. And so this episode is a bit of inside baseball. It’s a look behind the curtain of running a venture fund and TinySeed even a bit about the broader venture space. I find this stuff super interesting because it’s not something that I have ever been exposed to before running this fund. And who better to explain it than TinySeed co-founder a r Ette? Before we dive into our conversation, MicroConf Connect applications are open until tomorrow, January 15th. MicroConf Connect is an application only paid community. If you sign up in the next couple of days, you get access to our upcoming workshop with Kate Summa on January 23rd, 2025. You’re going to join Kate live as she delivers SaaS onboarding best practices and tips. Plus does a live teardown of a Connect members onboarding experience. We do a live workshop or event or sometimes it’s a q and a with me once a month every month for paid MicroConf Connect members. Head to MicroConf connect.com in the next 48 hours to apply and get in our January batch. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with a R in our set. Welcome back to Startup For the Rest Of Us.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:It is good to have you on the show, man. Folks know you from Hot Take Tuesday. They also might know you as the managing partner of Discretion Capital that helps seven and eight figure SaaS companies sell for amazing outcomes as well as co-founder of TinySeed. There  Einar Vollset:You go. It’s nice to have you all to myself without Tracy interjecting with her blue sky nonsense.  Rob Walling:Seriously, our open source communist  Einar Vollset:Blue sky. Yeah, yeah, that’s right.  Rob Walling:This is great. Hey Tracy. Hi Tracy. So today we’re going to go a little off the startups For the Rest Of Us beaten path, so to speak. And I have had a crash course over the past four or five years in not only just investing in startups, but then venture investing and what that looks like and how if you are a venture fund and you don’t return what the s and p 500 does, then you crash and burn. And I didn’t even realize that was possible. How valuations are created and frankly, we’re going to talk about TinySeed, the stuff we’ve learned. This is not just a big sales pitch of TinySeed. We are fundraising right now and folks can reach out to you TinySeed dot com slash invest if they want to get in touch if they’re an accredited investor. But the idea here is to share a bunch of the learnings that you and I have had. I think you had a lot more back in 2018 when we started this, but to talk about investing in startups, potential outcomes, and frankly, I also want to talk about TinySeed and really dig into why it’s different from say someone going through yc because we have folks who get into both and who have gone with TinySeed and that blew my mind to me. YC has been the gold standard of gold standards since I was a wheel ad and there really are some differences that cause folks to want to go the TinySeed path.  Einar Vollset:Yeah, that sounds good. And also I think it’s just even if you’re not going to go for TinySeed, you’re not investing in VC funds, I think it’s helpful to understand if you are thinking about funding, whether from TinySeed or other people, I think it’s worth understanding what are the incentives, how does this work on that end so that you understand what you’re signing up for.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s interesting. In bootstrapping, let’s say 10 years ago, gosh, when I did my talk, no, it must’ve been 20, I guess I did a talk 2017 or 18 at MicroConf four. I said, I think bootstrappers are going to start raising funding. And I hinted at it in a five minutes section in one thing and kind of got some pushback. And then the next one, half the talk was about it and it was right as we were starting TinySeed. And some people were like seriously pissed. They’re like, what? Pushing your book, since you’re doing that, you’re saying people should do it. And I was like, no, people are already doing it. That’s why we’re starting TinySeed is because there’s opportunity here. I had already invested in, I don’t know, eight maybe eight or nine, about eight kind of bootstrapped SaaS, mostly bootstrapped SaaS that I just put my own cash into. And so the openness and frankly the stigma of raising funding as I won’t say it’s gone because every once in a while I’ll see an any hacker post on Twitter about this is why I don’t raise funding, quoting some anomaly somebody sells for, what was it? Was it FanDuel or something sold for 500 million and the founder got nothing, but it’s like, yeah,  Einar Vollset:A lot more to that story, I’m  Rob Walling:Pretty sure. Yeah, there’s more to a story than that. So there’s always these exceptions, and when we surveyed folks for the state of independent SaaS, it’s somewhere around one in four or almost one in three, around 30% of bootstrap founders say they would at least consider raising funding.  Einar Vollset:Well, I think it makes sense. And also this has always been my thing. A little bit of a pet peeve thing is like, look, some of these purists on the never raise any funding part is they never raised any funding. Oh, is that because your wife works full time at Morgan Stanley and so basically can support you or you have rich parents or you’re basically wealthy. So it actually sort of democratizes starting your own SaaS business a fair bit for those that don’t necessarily sit on a bunch of cash.  Rob Walling:And it certainly makes it possible for less technical folks to do it as well because such a big cost. I was never anti funding. And even in the days of Drip considered like, man, it would be so much easier if I could raise four or $500,000, but I didn’t know anybody didn’t know how to do it. It was 2014. It is like all the stuff that’s available today wasn’t out there. So with all that said, with that preamble, let’s talk a little bit about venture investing, what success looks like and frankly, how many venture funds just miss the mark and don’t even beat an index fund that I could buy a Vanguard index fund?  Einar Vollset:Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, I think it’s just worth for people to think about. I think sometimes people think, oh, investing in VC funds think Sequoia Andrees and whatever, and it’s just like, oh, it’s how you get a hundred x. You read about these outcomes and you think they’re going to a hundred x. The fact of the matter is if you look at one of the golden decades for venture investing in the US was the decade between 2004 and 2014. It includes a bunch of, now well-known names came through that decade. And so you might think to yourself like to be in the top quarter of performance of venture funds in terms of return capital in that quartile, you probably returned, what do you think, like five x, six x, some of that, in fact, the actual math is more like two x, I think it’s 2.16 or something. If you as a venture fund in that decade, which was a good decade for venture funds return 2.1 x, then you were in the top quartile of funds.  Rob Walling:So that means if I invested a hundred thousand dollars into that fund, I got my initial a hundred thousand back and then an additional $210,000. Is that  Einar Vollset:Right? No, no. You put a hundred thousand dollars in and you got $216,000 back. So it was a 2.1 x  Rob Walling:And over the course of what, seven to 10 years?  Einar Vollset:Up to 10 years,  Rob Walling:Unreal.  Einar Vollset:That’s a tough quartile fund. And really the reason is because a lot of funds, and also look, I think the median fund still returns at least one x, but there is a good number that returned less than one X. It’s probably 40% of funds, you don’t even get your money back. That’s pretty common. And so then you look further is like, okay, well what’s great performance in venture? Clearly two x over in that same timeframe, the s and p 500 probably went way up. I mean it had the housing crash in 2008, but nonetheless, what is amazing world-class looked like? And that’s actually in that quartile, it was just over five x. So if you five x, if you’re a venture fund, that five xd, then you were in the top 5% of funds in that timeframe. And I think the reason why people sort of misunderstand this, they think venture and then they think like, oh, what do I think about when I think about venture? Well, it’s like Airbnb type returns. You hear about yc, they invested at whatever, probably put same. I was in the same batch, so I know what they put in probably 40,000, $20,000 and a thousand x or something like that. And so I think that sometimes translates into, oh, at the fund level, that’s the kind of return. So maybe not a thousand, but you’re getting a hundred times your money. But that’s an extreme outlier for venture funds. And really if you’re looking for a thousand X, you shouldn’t be in venture, you shouldn’t be in venture funds. That doesn’t make any sense. It’s almost impossible to get a thousand. It is impossible to get a thousand X in a venture fund or even a hundred x. If you’re wanting to do that, then you should put all your money into single bets. You should be investing in individual companies and concentrate your position as much as you can into your extreme high conviction bets and just go for that. And that’s the way to do that. But a lot of investors, they don’t want to do that. So the question then is why would you invest in a venture fund instead of doing that? The reason is you’re reducing risk. That’s what you care about. You’re basically trading off. You’re saying, look, okay, I’m willing to forego this notion that I’m going to a hundred x my money, but the flip side is I’m less likely to lose it all. The standard outcome if you invest all your money into a single company is you’re going to lose it. At least an early stage company, you’re going to lose all the money. And if that’s not something that you want to do that’s not part of your investment strategy, then investing in a fund makes sense and you’re making that trade off then,  Rob Walling:And that makes sense to me. So I entertained, after I sold Drip, I had a little bit of cash on my hands and I entertained the idea of investing in a couple of different venture funds and I never did, but it wasn’t because I didn’t think the returns would be there. It was because I had enough people approaching me through MicroConf and this podcast where I was like, that’s a legit business. Like Jordan Gall, right? With Card Hook at the time, and Justin McGill with lead views and there were just these great little B2B businesses. I was like, I kind of had enough people coming my way at reasonable valuations. To be honest, when I went on AngelList, here was the problem. I went to AngelList. I was like, oh, I’m going to make a few bets. And holy mother of, I mean the valuations for almost no revenue were like 10 million. And I did, I put five grand into one of those and I put 10 grand into another, and all of them either went to zero or returned one return to me, 11 grand from my 10 grand investment. I was like, all right. I consider that’s good,  Einar Vollset:Mean it’s probably above way above average return. So good job, yo.  Rob Walling:It really is. So I’m in a little bit of a unique position. I mean the whole thing is the deal flow is kind of coming to me.  Einar Vollset:Well, I think that’s the key thing. I tell people this and I’m not being unusually humble about this. And the fact is tiny C wouldn’t work if you weren’t there at least the early days. I don’t have the deal flow, I just don’t. And I think because of your background with MicroConf and startup For the Rest Of Us and all this stuff that people know about you, and there’s probably you and I’ve been saying there’s less than half a dozen people worldwide that naturally has that kind of deal flow, quality, deal flow, pricing power that’s coming your way. And I think really that’s part of the reason why you would invest in a fund. Because if you look at it, say you have an amount to invest, whatever that is, a hundred thousand, 250,000, 500,000, whatever, it’s okay. Well, if you do your research and look, you realize you probably shouldn’t just pile into just a single bet. You put it all on black as it were. So instead what you want to do is you want to go out and you want to make a lot of bets. Ideally, you probably, I think the math pretty much says if you’re going to have a better than 50% chance of at least breaking even, you should be making at least, I think it’s somewhere like 15 and 20 bets, like investments rather than bets. I shouldn’t call it bets 20 investments. But if you think about, okay, how do you do that? If you have a hundred thousand dollars, you say, okay, I believe the math, I want want to put a hundred thousand dollars in, now you have to write 20 checks of $5,000 each. Now you have more problems than when you started because do you have the deal flow to find 20 quality investments? Are you going to see enough good deals just from your networks and friends and connections and whatever on AngelList or whatever in order to make those investments? And I would argue that most of the time you don’t get to access the deal flow, you just don’t have it. But even if you did, so say you were uniquely well connected, now it’s like, okay, now you need to convince people to take a small check from you individually. So now most people aren’t going to take most people who invest, an individual investor that goes along and says, all right, well I want to put $5,000 in. It actually can be quite hard to, even if people are raising money, it can be quite hard to get people to accept $5,000 because it’s such a small check. So there’s usually a minimum before you have to get in.  Rob Walling:Absolutely. The minimum, in my experience, I believe every company I invested in was 25,000.  Einar Vollset:Yeah,  Rob Walling:Yeah. I mean I’m sure friends, you can get a friend who can cut you a deal or whatever, but if you are trying to make that many investments  Einar Vollset:And quality investments, a friend will do it. That’s great. But how many friends do you have? Do you have 20 friends that are really truly rigorously is high quality and that you can put $5,000 in? It starts to get difficult. And then on top of that, even if you get past, can I even get my check in? Can I get the deal flow? Then it’s like, okay, well who’s setting the price here? Are you going to be able to get it? Because whatever VCs tell you the name of the game in VC is entry price, exit price. If you overpay for your investments, then you’re not going to make any money If you invested 50 million pre for pre-product, pre-revenue business, it’s a really big hurdle for you to make a reasonable return obviously because you overpaid for it. And so that’s sort of the third thing that comes into it. It’s like, do you have the pricing power? So can you get the deal flow? Do you have the pricing power to get a reasonable valuation and can you even put your money in? And that’s alongside, okay, well you probably have a full-time job. How often are you doing these investments? Are you learning fast enough to stop doing stupid and start doing good investments? And that’s really the reason why along with spreading a risk, why people invest in venture funds as opposed to just being individual angel investors.  Rob Walling:And this is one reason that venture funds became content marketing machines and built brands. Do you remember, this is a recent phenomenon. I mean maybe at best it was between 2005 and 10 is my memory when they started really coming out. Because in the nineties, I grew up in the Bay Area, lived there, I worked construction there. I didn’t work in startups, but there was nothing published by venture funds. It was very, what do you call it, information asymmetry is my memory of the whole thing. It was very opaque. You didn’t know what term sheets, what even, I didn’t even know what terms meant and everybody was hiding everything. And it felt like in their early 2000, mid two thousands, probably around the time yc like Paul Graham and YC started coming up. The VC started marketing themselves as the Andreessen Horowitz and the Sequoias where they were putting out stuff first  Einar Vollset:Round, first round first was one of the main ones that did the early days and  Rob Walling:Then came 500 startups and Techstars where it’s like, here’s content to help founders. Here’s what a VC term sheet looks like. Here’s what all these terms mean. Here’s how you can get screwed by liquidation. And there’s the preferred and then participating. And there’s all these things that you didn’t even know what they meant. Brad Feld, right? He wrote a bunch of books about it. That was a big thing was for them to start a generating deal flow, but B, to get the trust I think from people so weren’t because you were a commodity before, it’s kind of like if I’m going to go borrow money for my house, who’s going to give me the lowest rate we know with no prepayment penalty? That’s it. It’s commodity, it’s numbers and it’s pricing. And that’s what I think veg was a little, at least from my perspective, was a little more like that at one point. And then it became not right, it became how do I get people to know me such that I do have some type of pricing power and also a lot of inbound interest.  Einar Vollset:And I think I know for a fact that’s sort of what YC partly y YC started is because it used to be kind like, how do you get access to this? And it was like, oh, my dad plays golf with this lawyer who can get you an intro and then you could get, but I think in part that’s why VC started out so geograph and remained to this day, so geographically concentrated because sort of what it was, everyone was sort of there and you had to be there. You had to be in Silicon Valley in order to get money and you had to have those connections and be able to work a warm intro. I mean, that’s still the case for the cases. People are figure out a way to get an intro. To me that’s turtle number one kind of thing. So for sure that’s been part of it.  Rob Walling:So let’s talk about valuations, how these valuations happen. And there was a big realization at one point where you and I were talking because I had always heard, boy, you need billion dollar exits in order for a venture fund to make money. So TinySeed is this question I think I asked, I think everyone asks, so how does TinySeed make this work without a billion dollar exit? How does all that work?  Einar Vollset:Well, I mean there’s a couple of different things here. And actually a billion to a degree, a billion dollar is apparently too small even in some cases. There was actually, I think it was Sam Altman who wrote a piece, not Mr. OpenAI, but used to be president of yc. He wrote a piece How to Invest in Startups, and I think that was like 2018, 2016, something like that. And his main point in that article, which I still think is up, was you shouldn’t invest in anything unless it can be 20 billion or more. Just don’t even waste your time unless you think it can be a 20 billion exit. I mean that article was in part the reason why TinySeed became a thing, because crazy  Rob Walling:It is.  Einar Vollset:I get it. He’s talking his own book at the time. That totally makes sense. If you have a lot of aum, a lot of money to put on, and you’re writing big checks and big outcomes and this is what you’re doing to a degree, it doesn’t matter. Entry price doesn’t matter, valuation doesn’t matter. You just got to find that thing that goes to 20 billion, that’s the whole game. And while that’s true, if you’re playing that game, then that’s how you should be playing that game effectively. Our argument was like, look, there’s got to be a way in which founders and investors can both succeed, where outcomes are not quite 20 billion. I think most of the people listening to this would agree that a 75 million or a hundred million dollars exit, even if it’s selling to some lowly private equity fund, that’s pretty good. I think a lot of people listening to this would think to themselves, if I owned 80, 90% of a company and sold for 75 million, I’d be having a pretty good Christmas right about now if that’s what was happening. And so effectively what we were thinking with TinySeed is like, look, there’s got to be a way where you can have that be success and everybody makes out well. And that’s sort of the ground thinking on the investing side for TinySeed is like, how do we make that happen? And really what that boils down to is a couple of different things. One is I don’t think it works for every single industry, every kind of product, every kind of service. There’s just some things that are just requires a lot of capital is extremely capital intensive. It makes total sense to keep raising money. And if you keep raising money and burning money, then the sort of winner take all stuff makes total sense here. Your Airbnbs, your hell, your new open AI stuff, it makes total, I’m not reasonable, gazillion a trillion dollars and this whatever. And even some of the smaller stuff is like, look, my standard thing is like look, if you’re going to be doing a home grooming startup service type thing that it’s going to be capital intensive. It’s like a Uber, you got to spend money on it and you’re going to get diluted up to wazoo and you have to gun for an enormous outfit to make any money. But what we realized is like, okay, but there is this subset of specifically B2B SaaS where it can work because for a couple of different reasons. One is it’s so capital efficient. A lot of the time the gross margins are like 95%. That’s not unusual. And quite often on the discretion side, I talk to founders and they’re like, yeah, do you think I’m profitable enough? I got 65% free cash flow. I’m like, okay, yeah, I think you’re profitable.  Rob Walling:This is great on recurring revenue, on millions in recurring  Einar Vollset:Revenue, you expanding revenue. And it’s like, it’s crazy. I mean you even see this and some of the go public companies like Zoom, and I think Zoom actually is the sort of poster boy for this, the Zoom, I think they went public with more money in the bank than they raised  Rob Walling:Something like that. It’s just incredible once they hit escape ity.  Einar Vollset:Yeah, and that’s sort of what B2B SaaS is like. And so I think it works for that and in a sense that there is this notion that basically if you take a little bit of money once and then you don’t need to raise anymore. You can if you want to, but you don’t need to. And so that’s what works for TinySeed or mostly Bootstrap or TinySeed like companies. And if you combine that then with what we consider to be reasonable valuation. So I think if you’re playing the classic VC game, 20 billion a bust, yeah, you’re right. It doesn’t matter that you’re paying 25 million for a pre-revenue product at YC demo day as a seed investor, it’s fine. Who cares if you could invest 25 at 25 million valuation into open AI or Airbnb, then great investment, go do it, but 25 million say and then it goes to a billion dollars. Let’s just say that rather than 20, let’s be a little less ambitious than Mr. Altman was. That’s a 40 x return on your money. That’s a good return. That’s a great return, sadly. And we can get in the math area, you might not be good enough for an investor like a fund investor, but the flip side of that is a billion dollars is still a billion dollars. It’s still kind of an unusual outcome. And I’m not saying valuation here. I’m saying actually cash like IPO or selling or whatever, not just make-believe valuations actual money in the bank. And I think that’s pretty rare. And the fact of the matter is if you come in, the kind of valuations that we do at, and it’s capital efficient enough that these companies aren’t raising money all the time. So say if we come in at a couple of million and 1.8 I think is our average, and then you 40 x that, that’s 70, 72 million. 72 million is still a lot of money, but it happens a lot more frequently than a billion dollars in discretion capital. We’ve done several deals this year that have been sort of in that range, and that’s just us and nobody ever reads about them. We actually did one years ago now we did that iceberg, the measuring the depth of the software iceberg title based on Patty eleven’s quote and observation there around most people don’t know how much money exchanges and so about for these kinds of outcomes and how common the big ones are or the reasonably sized ones. So that’s what it boils down to. Basically what we’re arguing is like, look, if you’re going for that kind of enormous outcome, then yeah, it makes total sense. Raise it 25 million and capital will go for it, become open ai become Airbnb. But there’s also this other class of startups where if you’re B2B SaaS and as an investor you can put money in at a couple of million and then they sell for 50 to a hundred million dollars, that’s as good. It doesn’t matter to you if you get 40 x your money, what do you care whether it 40 x means 75 million as an exit or 40 x means a billion dollars? It doesn’t. I mean other than bragging, right? It doesn’t matter. It just end price. Exit price.  Rob Walling:Exactly. And that’s the thing, the epiphany that I think I had at one point, or you kind of explained that to me, and it totally makes sense when you didn’t name the numbers, but the fact that the venture industrial complex is so focused on valuations and so focused on these large exits has almost to a point, like I’ll say brainwash some folks into thinking that’s the only way to do it. And what it does is it leaves out, I talk about my 1 9 90 rule where I say around 1% of startups should go after venture, about 90% should bootstrap. And I think about 9% should raise probably some type of funding. Maybe that’s TinySeed, it’s angels, but it’s not venture track. And the idea there is that going for 10 billion, 20 billion outcomes, it leaves out so many founders, thousands of founders who maybe should or maybe want to raise some type of money and still have a great outcome. And there is really no outlet for that. Before that we knew about it. Before us, it was ind BC and us. And then there’s obviously some individual investors. There’s a handful of others, but that’s where it is. And so what’s a trip is every application process for TinySeed, we do run it twice a year. Every six months, we inevitably get one company that we make an offer to and they come back and say, we’d love to take your money. We want to be part of it. But we were looking for a 10 million valuation. Or someone came, remember someone said 20 million and they were doing 30, 40 KMRR, whatever. I mean it was a respectable company, but it’s like, no, we’re like, no, you don’t understand. You don’t get your cake and eat it too. You don’t get TinySeed at that valuation. That’s not how we work.  Einar Vollset:And I think also some people, although I think awareness is raising a little bit, what some founders don’t understand is, look, there are trade-offs to this. Obviously if you can raise it a hundred million valuation, billion dollar valuation, there’s really great things about that. But some of the bad things are, there’s a whole universe of outcomes that are not the doors closed for you. If you raise it $25, the chances that you’re going to be able to or be allowed to sell for 50 is very low. In some cases. If you have extreme power and all this stuff and you didn’t give you any rights, that’s fine. But if you push valuations, the highest possible investors are going to put control provisions in there that sort of says, okay, look, the reason why we’re giving you this high valuation is because you’re saying you’re gunning for this enormous outcome. So we’re going to put some barriers in place. I mean, that pushes you, that aligns everyone to that kind of outcome or nothing, not get a high valuation and then sell for a reasonable amount. That door is very often closed.  Rob Walling:And that’s the challenge is especially if you’re a first time founder or have never had a big exit, I heartily believe this, and I’ve heard Dharmesh say this as well, so it makes me think it’s a really good idea, is if you haven’t had an outcome yet and you get some type, you get an offer for never have to work again, money. I don’t know man, I’ve the mind to take it and maybe that’s 10, maybe it’s 20, maybe it’s 30, it’s nowhere near what we’re talking about here, but get one, get a win, then you can do whatever you want. And I’m so much more an ascriber to that to kind of tucking that away. So I know of a company, I’ll keep anonymous, that raised, let’s say a prize was under 40 million in venture over a few rounds and due to liquidation preferences and other things, they would’ve had to sell for something like 80 something million for anyone but the VCs to get money, right? It’s like two x, I dunno all the details, but that’s the kind of stuff that I’m not sure people are aware of when they’re like, I’m going to raise it 10 or 20 million. It’s like, oh man, you’ve just really cut off a lot of your optionality. And that was such a big thing. I don’t say this as much when I talk about TinySeed these days, but in the beginning it was just optionality. We are optionality you can raise, you cannot do what makes sense for you. And we have had a bunch of people raise series. We’ve had a handful of folks raise several million,  Einar Vollset:A handful, but actually just to change track a little bit, not as many as I thought. It is funny, we raised our second fund in 2021 and obviously 2021 was a good time in the markets. And at the time I remember looking, I was like, oh, about 30% of the companies have raised money. That’s what I used to say. About a third, about a third. Then I was coming around to fundraising again. I was like, okay, let’s look at this. Actually it’s 8%, our tiny company less than 10  Rob Walling:Because 2022 and 2023 was such a disaster. There’s not that much capital. It’s very expensive now. And so that the number just plummeted. Right?  Einar Vollset:Exactly. And so they just haven’t done that. They just haven’t, have you raised any money? Money? And actually that sort of relates back to how the TinySeed different, and it’s like why I think people maybe don’t understand is how do venture measure performance on the way? Because the issue with a venture fund is like, well, good and bad. You don’t know for any good for at least 10 years. So if you’re a charlatan, you can kind of keep going for 10 years and say, oh, I’ll prove you’re right in a couple of years here. But I think it’s understanding how does most VCs, how does that make our life hard? Why is it a problem for a venture fund that only 8% of your companies have raised further funding? And the answer is, as traditional venture fund, it’d be a failure if only 8% of your companies raise money. And the reason for that is the way that venture investments work is that you as an investor when you come along or GP like a VC, basically you come along and you’re basically, every quarter or so, you send an update to your investors, to your LPs basically that says, this is what my portfolio is worth. And the way that you do that, obviously they’re not publicly traded. And so what you’re doing is you’re basically doing two things. You either keep the market the same, if they’re just nothing material has changed, IE, they haven’t gone out of business or they haven’t raised money, or if they raise money, then you mark it up to this new valuation because of the length of these funds, most of the time a successful VC can raise several funds without returning any money at all. It could just be like, Hey, I’m raising fund number three and look at my performance on my fund one and my fund two is up three x or whatever, two x five x. And it’s all based on markups. It’s all based on how successful are you, are your portfolio and raising subsequent raise more money at higher valuations to a large degree what success is in vc, if you can have a fund that, this is probably why YC is such a great business. They invested one point, whatever they do, and then it’s like the standard valuation markup three months later at demo day is like 25 million. Well, that’s an enormous markup straight there. It blows everyone else out of the water. They capture a lot of that value to be perfectly honest. And so what do we do well? So we have to come up with something different, which is always kind of challenging. And I think the difference for us is what we’re trying to do is to say, look, these companies, this successful companies don’t really need to raise any more money after this because they’re so capital efficient. So how do we capture the fact that the successful companies don’t raise any more money so there’s no automatic markups? And actually it is funny guys, in 21 when we had more markups and stuff, I remember doing it this way and I was just like, okay, well we will mark out why not? We’re not going to handicap ourselves. People would ask ’em. There’s really not necessarily quite of a correlation between the success of the company and the valuation markup. Because in 21 in particular, and this is true in all bubbly things, you would have people who raised because they were doing really well, and then people who raised because they were doing really badly and they were running out of money and they were going to go under unless they raised money. And so they were able to do so, and then they got marked up above what even some of the best performing companies that we had. And so what we decided to do was basically say, look, we’re going to give you a market price. And so we have a couple of different variants on this, but sort of our sort of base case valuation, which is most of the numbers we share out, it’s basically some sort of a revenue multiple based on growth mostly. And it’s somewhere between two X and somewhere between seven x. And really what that valuation is is different to even a typical VC markup in the sense that, look, if you raise a series A at billion dollars, that does not mean you can sell your company for a billion dollars. That’s just not happening. Obviously if you raise a 200 times a RR, you’re not selling it 200 times a RR. It’s not possible. Our base case valuation though, is more like what is the market price currently? What is the clearing price  Rob Walling:Sell for?  Einar Vollset:Yeah, what is the liquidation price of the portfolio at the moment? And that’s what we go to market with, which is kind of a handicap, I’ve got to be honest with you.  Rob Walling:Oh, big time. Much more conservative.  Einar Vollset:Much more conservative. And we provide the optimistic case, which goes up I think to up to 11 x, and we have one which includes the markups whenever they happen and they’re a little bit more, but most of the time we’re referring to the base case. So liquidation type valuation. And the reason for that is mostly that I want to be as conservative as possible. A, I basically want to be able to argue because we’re already doing something different. We’re not your typical what everyone else is expecting and like, oh yeah, this is how you get through an audit at Carta because the markups is from Andreessen and blah, blah blah. So we had to be a little bit more conservative. It can be a challenge. Although I will say, and although it’s not apples to apples, I was pretty stoked when card, which is our fund management platform, they came out in the spring with a performance metrics of 1800 funds, which actually includes us. And we were in the top five to six to 16% based on the venture metrics there, even using our most conservative metric evaluation. So that felt good, but it’s still a challenge because it’s new. People would rather have, in some cases, people are like, look, I believe that this company is worth a billion dollars because Andreesen says so even though they’re only doing 500,000 a RR more than I believe that this company is worth five XARR.  Rob Walling:I call it brainwashing or whatever it is. It’s a standard. It’s the safe. It’s nobody gets fired for buying IBM, right? It’s just the way,  Einar Vollset:Right? I mean, that’s always the case. I mean venture, I’m going to side ran here about venture and branding and stuff, but venture, I think a lot of the time it’s sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you get lucky very early on in the early fund and you get the brand built, then you sort of like capital comes to you and deal flow comes to you and it’s sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that you do pretty well. So my one piece of advice, if you want to be a classic VC and you want to start a new venture fund, is to be extremely lucky with your investments in your first fund. That’s the way to do it.  Rob Walling:That’s all you got to do. Just be lucky.  Einar Vollset:Just be lucky. That’s good.  Rob Walling:No hard worker or skill. Let’s just go all after luck on this one. Yeah,  Einar Vollset:I’m not investing hard luck or skill. I’m just saying given a choice, you would rather have be lucky than good. You’d rather be  Rob Walling:Lucky. Yeah. So as we wrap up, if folks are listening to this, if someone is an accredited investor, we are raising our next funds to invest in ambitious B2B SaaS companies. They can hit you up directly, TinySeed dot com slash invest. If they fill out that form that goes directly to your inbox. Anything else you want folks to know?  Einar Vollset:No, I mean, I think that’s it. I mean, it’s a little unusual. We’re just sort of like, this is, again, like we were saying, it takes 10 years to know if you’re good in this game. And we’re like, we’re in year five and indications are good.  Rob Walling:That’s what it is. The markers, yeah, the arrows are going in the right direction.  Einar Vollset:Things are good. We’re not a little bit unusual too. We’re not vastly increasing the size of our fund, which is quite common in the VC world. It’s very often you start with a small fund and you quadruple it and then that works out and you quadruple it again. And we’re not doing that. We’re just sort of like, look, this is what we feel good about. This is the size of this opportunity and we’re keeping the funds sort of the same and just keep executing the way it has been because it seems to be working. We think it will be continued to,  Rob Walling:And the reason VCs do that is that’s how you make more management fees is the bigger your fund, the more money you make. And we’re like, you know what? The opportunity that the deal flow we see in a six month period is X. It’s been really consistent, which is great, and we don’t want to raise twice as much money. Then what are we going to do invest in? We’re not going to double our deal flow in the next six months, maybe we’ll over years, but  Einar Vollset:We might put more. There’s opportunities we could put more money Dividual companies do. We do all this stuff. But fundamentally, the core strategy of TinySeed sort of remains the same. This is the size of the opportunity. This is what we think believes, and there are numerous venture funds that have done well at say, being a 25 million fund, and because they’ve done so well, lots of people are interested and then they decide, let’s raise $250 million. But if you’re 250 million, all of a sudden you’re doing different kinds of investments, maybe even in different kinds of companies, different stages. Who’s this? You’re good at that. Just because you’re good at writing $250,000 checks does not mean you’re good at writing $5 million checks into later stage companies. And your competition might be different and your deal flow might be different and your pricing power might not be there at that stage and all this stuff.  Rob Walling:So we’ve invested in almost 200 companies over four and a half years, and we’re going to stay at that pace. So the indexing across a lot of ambitious B2B SaaS companies seems to be working for us so far.  Einar Vollset:It allows us to keep the sort of batches small, right? It’s nice to have that, some of that intimacy. We’re not 150, 200 people in batches. We’re talking 20 people, 25 people, which is nice.  Rob Walling:TinySeed dot com slash invest if anyone’s interested. And a R volt on Twitter X Twitter. If folks want to see you posting about these San Francisco Giants  Einar Vollset:Or a r volt.com on Blue Sky. No, I’m only  Rob Walling:Kidding. Oh my God. Record scratch. I was like, what? You’re on Blue sky. You’re going to lose your bet. You’re going to lose your be to Tracy, thanks again man. Thanks for coming on the show.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Thanks again and R for joining me this week on the show. Thank you for joining me this week and every week.

For the Rest Of Us, I’m Rob Walling, and in this episode I speak with Jane Portman, the co-founder of User List, about how they’ve evolved their SaaS customer success process over the past seven years of running their mostly bootstrap company. In this episode, we cover the four stages that their customer success process has traveled as it’s evolved over this time. Before we dive into the conversation, I wanted to let you know about an effort that the team at TinySeed and I have been working on here in late 2024. It’s premium coaching and community for SaaS founders doing 1 million a RR and up. Right now we have a teaser page up at SaaS institute.com. If you are a founder who is at or in the neighborhood of 1 million a RR, any your email there and we will be reaching out with more information. This is going to be an elite and exclusive community application only hand chosen. It’s not intended to be an extremely large group of people, but it’s intended to get those that are at that point where YouTube videos and podcasts and even books are less and less helpful because you need more one-on-one focus and you want to be matched in a mastermind with other ambitious like-minded founders and you want to receive direct advice from handpick mentors and who better to do that than TinySeed. This is separate from our accelerator, right? Our accelerator is where we invest in early stage startups that are doing what between one and 2K MRR on the low end and maybe 40 k, 50 K on the high end. This is a high-end and highly curated premium coaching offering for those that are further along, basically doing seven or eight figures in a RR. So if you’re interested, SaaS institute.com. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Jane Portman. Jane Portman, welcome back to  Jane Portman:Startup For the Rest Of Us. Super thrilled. Super thrilled. It’s been like five years, right?  Rob Walling:It has in fact November 19th, 2019, episode 4 71, fighting to gain traction in a crowded space with Jane Portman of  Jane Portman:Still fighting,  Rob Walling:Still fighting in a crowded space. That fight never ends. Jane, let’s just be real. So for folks who aren’t aware, user list.com, you’re seven years into building that business with your co-founder Benedict, who many will know you and he from micro comps. The H one is email marketing automation for SaaS growth. User list is more than just an email marketing platform where your partner in successful implementation, you get proven SaaS frameworks, one-on-one onboarding and a dedicated support engineer so you can focus on hitting your growth goals. So tell us, Jane Portman, where does user list stand today? Give us an idea of how big the business is.  Jane Portman:Long story short, we a team of six all over the world and roughly profitable,  Rob Walling:Roughly profitable is just fine. You are a TinySeed company. You were in batch two, is that right? 2020,  Jane Portman:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Spring  Jane Portman:2020. Covid specifically March, 2020, which was very bright experience.  Rob Walling:Hey everybody, let’s meet up for an in-person. Well, we’ll do an in-person in six months. That was basically that year. That was tough for everyone too soon. I won’t drag everyone’s memories back to Covid. But today I wanted to have you on so we could talk about how you and your team have evolved your customer success practices over the last seven years. And before I hit record, you and I walked through and put together an outline of the four stages that you’ve traveled. And I really like this framework of thinking about getting something out that’s good enough. I actually talked about this in an episode just a couple of weeks ago. It’s first making it work, then you make it right and then you make it fast. And I feel like over the last seven years, your four stages have made it work, have made it right, and have made it fast. So talk us through before we dive into stage one, which I love that you said, it’s young and naive, that’s what we’re going to call it. Just talk about how customer success works for you in the business. What’s involved in customer success for you? Trying to get people onboarded into a very powerful product because this is a conversation I have when obviously I ran Drip, which is a similar type of company, very complicated. I would say it’s powerful. Drip is powerful, very complicated. And folks who run reen, and I’ve had this conversation, it’s electronic signature Reuben’s like people come in, there’s a button to upload a doc, you drag a signature field there, you’re onboarded. And I was always writer like Derek was, I was like, you create a link, you send the link, people book the link. I know there’s more to it than that, but realistically there are different gradients of complexity with products and not all customer success approaches work for each of them. And so you can be naive if you’re going to build a really complicated slash powerful product and think that, ah, everyone’s just going to self-serve and get on board. So with that preamble, talk us through user list and how that journey has been for you from a high level,  Jane Portman:If we knew what it takes for people to integrate and get started, if I knew as much as I know now, we probably just would not start, would not have started so many years ago because it’s insane. Somewhere in the middle we had a consult with a hidden shot and he said, I would not touch a product like this with a 10 foot pole because it’s incredible friction in the start. It’s just insane. I’m not sure it might be even easier for Drip because you can just import your list. User list provides SaaS email marketing automation, which is three times more complex than any other complex automation because you need to continuously update the information about your users in real time through the API integration. And there is no way around it because the users, they come, they go, they change plans, they do something inside their product and you send information about that into useless. So we then can use that data to build segments and you can build segments, workflows and do all that jazz that you came there to do. And then you need to come in and think about what you’re going to be sending and write your campaigns and set them up. There is a whole second layer to this. And I think when we were just starting out, we thought that some templates are going to cut it for the creative part and the data part. I dunno, we just didn’t think about how much work it is, which now we know that in order to successfully integrate, people don’t just need to push some events and some properties inside useless, they need a tracking plan first so that the marketer doesn’t have to go back to their engineers every month asking for new things. It needs to be somewhat wholesome to move forward. In the ideal world again, yeah, there’s a lot of steps. The integration, segmentation, creative part, setting everything up and then running day to day is another thing that they probably need to less extent.  Rob Walling:And that’s a ton of upfront friction as Heon said. And so you have to be, and then it’s like, well, so then you need to be able to charge a ton of money so that you can spend all this time to get people onboarded and your retention’s going to be high. But the problem is you are one of, if I were to guess 500 different email products one could use now not directly aimed at SaaS and has a functionality you do, but people start, they compare you to MailChimp or Drip or ConvertKit and they’re like, well, why are you four times the price of MailChimp? And it’s like, well, because we have all this stuff. And so it’s this constant push and pull of trying to convince people of how different and how powerful you actually are to justify any type of price discrepancy, but also not be having infinite pricing power because there are so many options that people can kind of hack and get. It’s 50, 70, 80% of the way there and they can justify it to themselves that like, well, I’m not going to pay $300 a month when I can pay 40 to MailChimp, but it’s like, ah, but it’s not going say, you know what I mean? So do you find that this, can you tell I’m speaking out of trauma because I had these conversations over and over?  Jane Portman:Well that verbatim, I basically wake up with this. I’m like, how do we niche down? Where is that? Is that inflection point where we finally crack this miracle puzzle of where’s that key of niching down? Because niching down as far as I see the market at the moment is the only way to move forward. It’s insane how folks that are getting billion dollar funding moving forward and they’re just doing some insane things. And that’s slightly depressing for a team of six. There is another angle to this industries that when 20 years email automation came out, it was Infusionsoft, AWeber expensive. You would use a consultant for it for a reason and you would pay much for a reason. These days you can buy whole range of pricing, you can buy a very cheap stool, but you still need to know what to do with it. And the question is, do we just leave people alone or do we really teach them to do this? And this is a very, very interesting niche because there is no university degree for email automation. So it’s not precisely marketing and not precisely engineering. It’s in the mix needs a technical mindset but also needs marketing brains behind it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, makes it a double whammy. So let’s dive into this. We have these four stages that you, yourself, your company has traveled on this customer success journey. You dubbed stage one, I hinted at it earlier, young and naive. Talk us through what that stage looked like.  Jane Portman:So what we did, we wrote a bunch of email templates, we baked them into the product so it was easy to use. And then we also, because I’m a designer, can design well, I designed a bunch of printable worksheets that people could fill out, print out, fill out and enjoy themselves. So what we did, we distributed those around throughout the channels throughout the website and we were kind of said that, yeah, look how much we’re doing. We’re awesome. We really thought so  Rob Walling:And you’re done. That was it. That’s the end. It’s just one stage. I was kidding. So everyone took those and filled them out and used them a hundred percent, right?  Jane Portman:Yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. That’s what happened. I guess we just didn’t bother that much because there were other fish to fry at the moment. We were onboarding folks mostly manually I guess at those stages. And we were just somehow stumbling forward, raising angel rounds, doing other things. Well, yeah, just moved forward.  Rob Walling:And here’s the way I think about this. There’s an old book by Jeffrey Moore called Crossing the Chasm, and I believe it came out in the early nineties maybe. And the book was more written for large scale adoption of think of palm pilots. Anyways, there’s five key segments that Jeffrey Moore broke this down into where you have, these are groups of customers, there’s the innovators who will use a product and they just love toying around with stuff and they’re willing to put up with a lot of pain and do a lot of work because curious and because it might provide value for them. So innovators then there’s early adopters, early majority, late majority, and the laggards, and I think what you’ve touched on because I’ve experienced this as well, is that your innovators and maybe some early adopters were fine with the young and naive face that they were cool with worksheets and templates. But those segments are very small and if you see this graph, obviously you can Google it if you’re listening to this episode, it’s like a bell curve and the innovators and early adopters are just a tiny, tiny, just not that many people. The masses are in that early majority and late majority. And so as you find that hey, a bunch of people aren’t converting, you entered stage two, which we’ve called Hire Someone. That’s a really good name. So it’s really descriptive. What do you mean hire someone? Who’d you hire? How did it work out?  Jane Portman:Entered 2021, I think end of 2021. We just raised our second round a little bit of money from Angels. We hired developers, we were like, we can do more. And we identified that there is this area of proactive customer success that we can tackle. And so we sat on a journey to hire such a proactive person that could be Prince Charming, talk to people, do demos and just overall communicate a bunch. And I think we circled through three candidates that didn’t work out. I’m not going to go in detail, but particularly exciting things like one of them completely lacked empathy. Someone lacked tact about giving advice to people and we are not, I’m not going to go there anyways. It’s interesting. How  Rob Walling:Did you hire them and hire them? They started and then you had to fire them.  Jane Portman:It wasn’t like a trial training period, but yeah, they were being onboarded when we learned that. And it’s interesting, I think our hiring process has improved since then, but also it was not like we had a board and all that jazz. It’s not like we hired strangers and then Michael Christoph of P GMA started our friend, he was one of the early applicants for the job and we were like, no, Michael, you’re too qualified. No you, you’re not coming in. And then I had a consultation with him and together we figured out that what we first thought should be proactive support is actually about being helpful when they have that momentum to get started during the early days. So we actually needed just plain support, just support. And that was the beginning of 2022 when we put a smart person engineer Michael in the support inbox. And that just changed our lives first because everybody should delegate support even though there is not much, it’s really frees up the hands. And second, it just gave us a whole next level of customer investigations and all these things. There is a bunch of troubleshooting that happens in email automation. So he was taking this off Benedict’s shoulders and that was really tangible. So that was nice and that worked for a while.  Rob Walling:So was you went to hire a customer, A CSM, we call him a customer support manager, which is an individual contributor who is going to be frankly mostly a little bit reactive but mostly proactive. And after these failed attempts, you just said, let’s just hire an engineer who can handle the support inbox. Is that the summary of it? And it worked?  Jane Portman:It’s not like the first role means the second role, but while we were trying to fill out the first, we learned that we actually need just someone really smart on support. And probably there is still space for going through accounts and reaching out to customers and things like that, but it’s really secondary compared to being there for onboarding.  Rob Walling:So that’s the difference is some people, when you say customer success, that is a lot of different things. There’s actually a lot of roles within that, right? There is onboard onboarding is only one part of that. Once people are a customer, there’s retention, there’s even instrumenting and reporting and doing analytics on onboarding. And there the amount of people who are getting onboarded, there’s a lot more to it than just onboarding. I think there’s a drinking game. I think we have six shots. I’ve said the word onboarding now six times. So it sounds like as you looked at customer success as a whole, you realize well maybe we don’t need to cover all of the bases and we should really more focus on getting people connected, getting the APIs connected and getting that early stage done such that they stick around. Am I understanding that right?  Jane Portman:That’s correct. And my personal, well that’s because I was kind of supervising this, but my biggest discovery is a person was that I was wrong about the skillset of such person. It’s way less about being charming. Michael is super charming by the way, but it’s less about being charming and great in camera and whatever not, but way more about technical investigation skills and that is related to our product and our niche. So maybe different for your situation. I don’t think it’s the one size fits all answer.  Rob Walling:So I want to touch on something you mentioned. You mentioned funding, you said raising rounds, raising angel rounds, and some folks listening to this might be thinking, oh well how much have you raised is probably the question on their mind. So first question is have you talked about it publicly? And if not, let’s give people an idea. I don’t think you’ve raised millions of dollars, right? You’re still mostly bootstrapped.  Jane Portman:Our second round was a little bit short of 400 K, something like this. We don’t have this. Yeah, we don’t have this number in public, but we have a nice blog post outlining the list of investors. So it was not sacred.  Rob Walling:Good. I just wanted to touch that so people have an idea,  Jane Portman:Which is not a lot of money. It is not a lot of money if you’re building something like it  Rob Walling:Sounds like a lot of money and it’s totally not. This is the thing, Jane, when we were building Drip, I was about 150 to 200,000 of my own money and that got us to product-market fit and then no other money raised. And this is a hard road. It was doing it on hard mode. I knew it. I was going to say in retrospect, it was doing it on hard mode. I knew it at the time, it was doing it on hard mode, but there was no avenue. This is what 20 13, 20 14, there was no TinySeed and there was no bootstrapper friendly funding. And this is before Iny vc, this is before no angels I knew would invest in a bootstrap company that didn’t want to go the venture route. So it’s nice that that is now an option for so many bootstrappers not only has the stigma, remember when Bootstrappers used to be like never raise funding. Funding is terrible, it’s so black and white. And now that stigma has been largely removed, at least in most of the circles that I run in.  Jane Portman:We went through the cycle very properly step by step first being brave to apply to TinySeed then oh there is nothing scary there. And then friends talked me into talking Benedict into getting more and yeah, it was not VC money but maybe with VC money you get different dynamic still to explore this.  Rob Walling:Yeah, for sure. Alright, so let’s enter stage three again. Stage two was hire someone stage three done for you, it’s offering done for you services. Talk through what that means and how that’s evolved.  Jane Portman:So in stage two, customer success engineer at that time we were really starting to build our expertise because we were onboarding users, learning about automation. We built a fabulous expert blog and then we were getting advanced into we know how it should be done well and we see nobody’s doing it well. You just keep watching people struggle and you know how to do this, but you understand that no, it’s not a way forward to try and educate them from day one. And the way forward is probably to either recommend them to hire a consultant or do it for them. And we went as hard as writing the first email saying, no, you can’t do this yourself because there is five people in the world that are professional and you’re not one of them. So either get a consultant or here’s our done for you page, which was probably a little bit too aggressive. So we don’t have that email now. And that was early 2020. What was last year? 2023 that we started on this direction and these services were surprisingly easy to sell compared to selling software. We were like, we sent an announcement and I got the first customer immediately. I was like good old consulting days when you can actually sell something quickly and make a lot of money. Well  Rob Walling:Yep, consulting, it’s a business code, selling dollars for hours. That’s why a lot of us start there.  Jane Portman:So I was executing this myself as a consultant also learning a bunch. And honestly it’s more about that joke when it’s like $1 for hitting the hammer and $9 for knowing exactly where to hit the hammer. It’s kind of that kind of work a lot. So it was not too bad. I served a few packages and burned out because the reason why we started SaaS was to get out of consulting people and now we are back in this. We have all the SaaS, we have the marketing machine going and services on top of that. That was really painful, but we kept offering this. It was not a huge stream. So it was a nice supplementary income, nice learning customers because when someone purchases a package, they’re pretty much guaranteed to get started and just overall good experience. So yeah, that was a netbook that allowed us to build the expertise even more because now we really did the drill for multiple companies and had feedback and implemented also actually helps to troubleshoot the tool itself quite a bit because you’re using it yourself. You’re dog fooding a bunch. It was good, it was definitely good things to do and it takes a bunch to set this up so you have to write your sales page. We also got a consultation from an email marketing consultant Summer os. She taught us her trade secrets on how to better approach the process with clients and we had these materials developed for intake questionnaires and steps and procedures and stuff. So when that was developed it was just great to have it live and going and available for customers when they need it. I guess that’s the description of this stage.  Rob Walling:And is this something that you would recommend to other SaaS founders if they similarly have a complex product or a powerful product that takes a lot to get onboarded? It sounds like that’s why you’re here is that folks would come sign up and then just never, you just wouldn’t retain ’em, they wouldn’t get set up and so you’re just removing one more excuse. Well I don’t have any emails and it’s like go hire a consultant. You could have a page with agency partners who do this for them.  Jane Portman:We haven’t  Rob Walling:But those agents, but people maybe don’t want to go to ’em or they’re expensive, right? Because what’s the range, the price range that you’re offering the done for you?  Jane Portman:Yeah, I can tell you the most popular package is the user onboarding kit includes the user onboarding campaign, like trial expire, expired trials, reactivation. So all the campaigns around activation, it’s $4,000 and consultants typically charge, I dunno, eight 12 K for the same thing up to 20 K sometimes. Depends on how much goes in this,  Rob Walling:Right? So you are in essence offering a deeply discounted thing that is highly repeatable for you because you already have infinite client, infinite, it’s not true, but you have a steady flow of incoming new clients. So you’re not out there really marketing it already marketing user list and it’s repeatable for you and you can offer it cheaper because you want them as a customer. You want that a CV. So it’s interesting. Would you recommend that someone else do this?  Jane Portman:You just sold it in five different benefits, didn’t you? So yes, of course, but also I guess it depends on what kind of lifestyle you want for yourself and the style of your business. I know some companies that were only made able to make the financials work with the services because otherwise it just didn’t take off. We know some peers who only have let’s say paid guided onboarding, which is a flavor of done for you. They have a thousand bucks set up fee, which is for bootstrap SaaS company who’s our customer, probably overkill to make it the mandatory fee, but that person I am talking about, they made it mandatory for everybody because it was pretty acceptable in the industry and they had a smashing success with it. So it depends. But at this point in my life, after seven years, I’ve really given up on trying to teach people as they get started. There is definitely a segment of bright folks who are willing to learn. It’s not impossible, but a typical busy person is not willing to absorb your information to make really qualified setup. It’s just either let them do their basic things or do it yourself really well. I guess that’s the barbell strategy of Nasim Tale. Either very simple or very complicated and expensive. The mid range is a danger zone.  Rob Walling:So before we move on to stage four, I want to ask you about your blog as a marketing channel. And the reason this ties in is you told me offline that as you learned more and more about the thought process and the pieces that need to go into place for all the emails that a SaaS company needs, you started the done for you offering, doing it for all of them. You started realizing, oh there’s same patterns over and over and same ideas, same thoughts. And so you took that knowledge and now you’ve written a bunch of blog posts with that knowledge of here’s how to write this sequence, here’s how to do this and make it work. And so my question for you about that is, is that working? Because it’s a lot of work, right? The done for you, you’re getting paid for, but then to take that and to write up 2000, 3000 word blog post and put it out there on Google in the age of AI where people are getting more and more answers from ai, has that effort been worth it?  Jane Portman:Definitely. So because just the niche of SaaS email marketing automation, thankfully with the word SaaS in it is narrow enough for us to be able to plant a footprint there. And then everybody who writes very shallow, very shallow bare bones stuff like lead the users to the aha moment. Nobody talks how to set up the triggers, how to orchestrate the journey, how to segment people really hard and a lot of others there is an endless amount of implementation details you can dive in and different ways to serve them. And going back to SEO, thankfully having the word SaaS is really helping for things like SaaS, email marketing strategy and things like that. And we also, in answering your second part, the effort, we also have two parts to this. One is big expert guides, which I write myself two, three times a year. And then we publish monthly roundups of email examples tailored to specific SaaS situations like I dunno, we just published a post today, invite your team kind of emails. And we have a lineup of 20 emails that companies send during their own boarding flows. Very narrow, very niche, very specifically curated and described. If you go to popular platforms like really good emails, you’re going to find 80% emails from E-commerce purely curated. So you’re not going to be able to do that. So with email examples, we kind of really hit our tried. We have a community advocate who goes around collecting examples in the communities, also distributing pieces there. So it’s a content flywheel of sorts because we’re collecting examples in exchange for backlinks from people then using these examples for SEO. And this is great material and it seems obvious maybe for Reuben but not for me. It took a few years to figure out  Rob Walling:Someday we all are on our own journeys Jane,  Jane Portman:And maybe that’s why we are still so hot on the topic. Me and Benedict, for Benedict, it’s probably never ending technical challenge. We’re never relaxing and I’m never relaxing on the educational side. It’s always how can we better explain this? How can we better teach that? What’s the easier way? You don’t want to be like Big Bang theory complicated about it. Nobody’s going to read. You want to be human about very hard topics. So how do you do that?  Rob Walling:And you don’t mean Big Bang theory, the sitcom, you mean the scientific principle as defined by physicists?  Jane Portman:Correct. I mean the sitcom, like this type of language they  Rob Walling:Use. I got it. The complexity. All right. Alright, so with that I do want to get into stage four, which is developing your own frameworks that you have developed out of the done for You work. Talk us through what it looks like today.  Jane Portman:So this year with doing more than for you projects, it was obvious that some patterns are emerging and one of the patterns was the way we use existing materials that every SaaS has and that they’re different for every business. Some startups are heavy on videos, some startups have a great blog, some startups offer 20 types of onboarding calls and just different things people have. And the way we use these materials in the process to craft actual storyboards for the campaigns and the campaigns. And we wrote a guide about it and as I was writing the guide, I knew this was a very good piece of content. I wanted to make it into a framework. I tried to find an acronym and I spent an hour. The example for this is like Pirate metrics, A RR, the company may be dead, we all know the pirate metrics. So we wanted to craft something equally timeless, but I couldn’t find an acronym and I was always stumbling on that moment. When you break down what you have into, you atomize your resources into atomic small emails. And I was like, hmm, maybe there is something about the word atomic that deserves that James Clear really likes that we can also use. So nothing revolutionary there and went for the name. And then now that that was done, it was a revelation that actually we also have another system for the first stage where we help our users to segment their journeys and use this as triggers and things like that. So lifecycle segmentation is something that we have been teaching for ages and now we have a framework for the creative side of things. So it’s obvious that we have system for this and system for that. So we thought, no, that’s probably called frameworks and we started using that to promote on the website. Our homepage has a section with fancy images where get started with our frameworks and basically highlights that we can help you at every step of the stage. And now this is another PR thing. We can go around customer success shows and talk about using frameworks. Hey, hey Rob, here’s how we got the placement with you. So it’s like in a rendering cycle of doing things, talking about them, meta talking about them, and then so on and so forth, which is pretty fascinating to be honest.  Rob Walling:Yeah, folks want to check out atomic emails. You can go to Google and just type it in. It’s look for user list.com or obviously we’ll link it up in the show notes, but it’s a very thorough and obviously very knowledgeable article written from experience. There’s a difference, you said this earlier of people are publishing content about SaaS emails and what they do is they either go to Jet GPT or Baird or they go to a freelance writer who doesn’t know anything about SaaS emails and then they do some Googling and then they research and then they put something together That is a cursory thing to try to rank. And I mean that’s not what you’ve done here. All the posts on your blog, to be honest, feel like chapters of an ebook or even a short ebook, you know what I mean? They could be combined into a pretty interesting collection challenge of course is it changes so often. So don’t do a book Jane, because by next year it’ll all be out of date. But that is an interesting competitive advantage that these days people are like, oh, content is dying. SEO is dying. And I don’t necessarily, everything’s sensational. I don’t necessarily agree or disagree with that. But the idea that you can’t still put out really deep, thoughtful, long form content on the internet, on a topic someone cares about and have them discover it and use it, it’s still viable today if you put in the time. But it’s hard, right? It’s a lot of work and takes a lot of knowledge.  Jane Portman:It’s a choice because we don’t publish anything but awesome these days. So when someone says, let’s co-market our integration, all you need is publish a blog post on your blog and we’re like, Nope, we’re not publishing a blog post on our blog for a new integration. We are only doing really cool stuff. And we also said, yeah, it’s a whole separate topic for the podcast because we went through the stage of hiring of trying to hire experts to write for us for 2000 bucks a pop. And we did a few, like 1500, $2,000. And it just, again, we stumbled into the same problem that folks are awesome in theory. And I can tell they’re not practitioners, they’re not working with real claims on this specific, well I don’t want to bring them down. They’re fantastic, but not what we’re looking for. There’s too much technical detail in this. So now we’ve settled on this combination of doing this ourselves and and using community examples for other types of posts.  Rob Walling:Jane Portman folks want to find you on X Twitter, you are at UI breakfast and are you on Blue Sky?  Jane Portman:Yep. Just joined lately.  Rob Walling:Alright, are you UI breakfast as well?  Jane Portman:Yeah, ui breakfast.com. That’s my old consulting domain.  Rob Walling:Amazing. Well, thanks so much for joining me today, talk about customer success.  Jane Portman:Exciting. Thanks for having us. Rob.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Jane for joining me on the show.

In this episode, I talk through my nine startup predictions for 2025. I’m recording this in mid-January of 2024, and I like to take a bit of time each year to think about how I think the landscape might change in the coming year. And frankly, most of these are around SaaS, but there are a few that aren’t directly going to impact SaaS. And so I just said startup predictions in the title and predictions are really tough. If you’re actually looking ahead and trying to forecast things, no one knows what’s going to happen. So take these with a grain of salt. There’s at least one of them that I kind of hope doesn’t happen for the sake of all the startup founders that I am rooting for, but nonetheless, if I think there’s a good chance it’ll happen, I want to include it in this episode. Last episode, I went through my predictions for 2024, and you probably noticed, I think maybe I had what a 30 or 40% hit rate 50% at best. So keep that in mind when you hit predictions for me or anyone else that at best we’re going to be as good as maybe a coin toss. Before I dive into the predictions, if you missed backing the Kickstarter for my new book co-written with Dr. Sherry Walling, it’s called Exit Strategy. The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret. You can now buy it on pre-order in paperback form. So the Kickstarter was for hardcover, but if you go to exit strategy book.com, you can either order an electronic copy or a paperback copy, and you’ll get that in a few months once everything is ready. So if you missed it, exit strategy book.com. And with that, let’s dive in to my first prediction. I’m going to go through three of them as a group because of these three I made for 2024, and I’m just carrying ’em through and I realize that’s kind of cheating. So I’m kind of combining these all into one. My first is that Twitter will change hands in 2025. I think either the debt’s going to be called due, someone’s going to do a hostile takeover. The valuation is so low. I just think it is inevitable that Twitter will change hands here at some point. And so I’m calling my shot like Babe Ruth, and I’m saying 2025. My second prediction is that no code and low code will get unit tests and version control. So in 2024, I predicted it would be professionalized and I put that in quotes, and then I did a text expander on professionalizing kind of defined what I meant by that. Realistically, the fact that no code and low code don’t really have unit tests and version control at this point, as far as I know, the tools we use, the airts, the bubbles, the softers, the Zapier stuff gets pretty brittle. And it reminds me of how we coded in say the late nineties or the early two thousands. And I do think it will evolve. So unit test and version control coming for no code and low code, and I do think there’s opportunity there for startup founders. My third prediction carried over from last year is that Stripe will go public in 2025. Not much more to add to that one. So my fourth prediction for 2025 and the first new one is that search volume for Google Organic SEO. And I’m talking about content-based keyword targeting where you’re cranking out an essay, an ultimate guide, a blog post. I think they will slide across the board by at least 15% in 2025, specifically as they give way to AI searches. Now, realistically, when I first wrote this down, I put 25% and I thought that might be too much, but I think there’s a real chance it can be between 15 and 25% specifically due to AI searches. And the reason I’ve said specifically due to AI searches three times now is because Google has messed around with their search engine results for what the past decade in terms of making ads at the top look like organic results, and then just bumping the organic results further and further down the page to the point where if you’re searching on a lot of laptops, you don’t even see organic results above the fold. That’s not what I’m talking about. I think Google will continue to pull shenanigans with that, but the number of times now that I do searches in Google and the AI answers it quite accurately and cites sources is just shocking. And so this zero click trend that a lot of folks ran Fishkin over at Spark Toro I’ve been talking about, but a lot of other folks as well, it used to be that it was a little box with a summary. What’s the weather like? And it just had the weather at the top instead of linking you to weather.com like it would’ve done 10, 15 years ago. But now AI is doing that. And now AI answers pretty complex questions. In fact, in preparation for this episode, I have a prediction later about self-driving cars, self-driving taxis. And I had remembered that people have projected how many traffic deaths can potentially be avoided around the world if everybody used self-driving cars. But I couldn’t remember what the percentage was. Is it down 90? Is it 95, is it 98? And so I typed that into Google and the AI at the top had excellent results. I think it said between 90 and 94% of the projections, and these are the different sources and blah, blah, blah. And it just summarized everything. I didn’t have to click anything. So that’s just one example. But I find that being more and more common and what used to happen is I would Google it, I’d see the AI result, and I would question the AI result. Is this legit? Because AI can hallucinate as we know, but they are citing sources and you can see the sentence from the source. So things are going to get dicey. It’s going to be interesting to watch as search engine clickthroughs drop significantly in the coming years. And if you look back, Ruben Gomez and I had a conversation about this three or four months ago, you can search for his name at startups For the Rest Of Us dot com to listen to that episode where we talk through organic SEO and his company. Sewell relies a lot on organic SEO, but you’ll hear his perspective on it. It is very much facing the present reality, but also there are ways around this content-based keyword targeting is only one way to do SEO and Google. What are the other ways that maybe won’t be impacted by ai? And this among all the other predictions is the one that I don’t want it to happen because guess how many startups I’m invested in? I advise or I’m rooting for that rely on content-based keyword targeting. There’s a lot of them, but we do have to face the current reality when we are building our companies. My fifth prediction is that ads in AI chat interfaces like chat GPT or Claude or whatever other chat interface you use will become commonplace because this is the next frontier. As eyeballs move from clicking on the 10 blue links on the Google search engine result page, it’s natural that these free interfaces have to make some type of money. They have to start monetizing at some point. And so they’re going to be toying around with different types of ads and I don’t know if they’ll look like AdWords or not. Will they be display ads? Will they be text ads? Will they be a video popup? Will they be just a sentence embedded in the AI’s thing of like, Hey, if you like this, maybe if you searched for this, maybe you want to buy a self-driving taxi. That doesn’t actually make a lot of sense, but you get the idea. It can be interwoven into the message. There’s a lot of creative approaches to this. I think IT companies will overdo it. It’ll be super annoying because marketers ruin everything and monetization ruins everything. But my prediction is that we will, I know we’re already seeing a little bit, I think there’s one company right now that’s testing ads in their AI interface as I’m recording this, but it will become, dare I say, almost ubiquitous one year from now, my sixth prediction, another, there’s two more related to ai. And look, I’m sorry, I’m not like a big AI proponent or opponent. I think it is just shifting the landscape of everything and the fact that Google’s 10 blue links are being disrupted shows you what a monumental shift across the entire tech community and the startup community and frankly the world. It reminds you of how big of a shift it is. So my sixth prediction is that Google will see its biggest ever drop in revenue due to the transition from 10 blue links being the prominent way people search into AI ads. And I think Google’s going to have a bit of time that they’re going to need to figure it out because realistically, it’s some astronomical number, and I should probably go to Jet GPT or Claude and ask this, but I think it’s something like 95% of Google. I say Google, it’s Alphabet is the parent company. 90 to 95% of alphabet’s revenue comes basically from online advertising. And this AI phase shift, this huge transition is going to disrupt that and figure it out eventually, I think. But I don’t think it will happen without some type of drop. And Google really hasn’t seen any major drops in revenue from what I can recall over the past 25 or whatever years. So that is my prediction number six. And I want to just pipe in here. I don’t want to pipe in before my seventh prediction. As you listen to these, think about where the opportunity is going to be for Bootstrap startups and as we see shifts and new tools arise, like let’s say they do have ads in AI chat interfaces, well, they’re going to have to have an ad management tool for that that they will build. They being who chat, GPT, Claude, whoever. Usually those are not going to be very good at the start. So if they have an API, is there a way to build a third party tool that can manage the ads better? This is what TinySeed company Link Low has done for LinkedIn ads. It’s link low, do io. If you are using LinkedIn’s built, built-in ad interface, you know how painful it can be, and Link Low helps make that a lot better. So is there an equivalent for these other new ad interfaces that are going to be created? That’s just one idea. One example I think of as I look through these predictions, my seventh prediction is that the term AI will be used in fewer H ones than it is today, especially across startups because AI will just be assumed. It will just be the norm, it will be the default. You will assume AI is in every product that you log into in every SaaS app that you use as it becomes ubiquitous. I think back to maybe 2005 on the internet when as SaaS companies, they weren’t called SaaS back then. They were called software, web software, web-based software or a SP application service providers. As those became more prominent, they literally would have statements on their homepage, you don’t need to operate a server to use our software. It’s not client server access from any internet browser and also entering your credit card is safe and secure, all this stuff. That was such a paradigm shift to get people to try to get their head around it. Well, it’s like, well, I don’t need a server. How do I do it? And there would literally be FAQs of, well, you just log in here in the web browser and you use the software and you had to explain that to people. And these days it’s like, well, it’s AI for this and it’s your AI assistant and it’s your AI. That I think, I mean I guess if it’s an AI assistant that’ll stick around, but I do think there’s going to be a new term that comes around because AI means too many things right now. And I almost wish the term virtual assistant that came to mean someone who was remote, right? It’s like, oh, back in the four hour workweek days of, I don’t remember when that was, oh eight or oh nine, virtual assistant came to me. Oh, I have someone in the Philippines or in APAC or in just an inexpensive region and really virtual, I don’t know. I wish that term hadn’t already been co-opted for that because AI means too many things and I think there will be terms that splinter off of this to better describe what they actually are. But all that said, my prediction is not that I’m digressing, I am predicting that the term AI will be used in fewer H ones one year from now because it will just be assumed that AI is built into everything. Now in the near term, I think the number of applicants two TinySeed and two Y Combinator that include the term AI will stay the same. Hopefully it doesn’t go up. I mean, I think the number of companies or the percentage of companies accepted into Y Combinator that say they use some form of ai, it was like in the most recent batch was 85 or 90%. It was some astronomical number TinySeed that much, but it was definitely, if I were to just ballpark it, maybe 40 or 50% in our most recent batch. I’m not sure it’s that high, but you get the idea, which is very much up from zero. No, we actually had, I think we had maybe 5% two years ago, three years ago before chat GPT, it was kind of one in each batch was using AI to do something. And then it has slowly slash quickly ticked up to where we got a lot of applicants. The problem with a lot of the AI tools that applied to TinySeed is they have this super sharp growth curve and crazy high churn. And so you can’t outrun that kind of churn, 15, 20, 20 5% churn. And I just think a lot of them are catching a temporary wave and there’s opportunity there in the short term. But to build a long-term sustainable business to make it that long, most of them will not. And it’s the same thing you see on X Twitter or blue sky folks launching and like, Ooh, ai, look at this growth. And then yeah, a few months later, the Hubbubs died down and you don’t hear from them anymore, and then you see it for sale on a choir for a fraction of what you think it would be worth. And so there are very, very few, I’m not saying there’s zero, there are very few that are AI rappers chat GPT rappers that will be around for years. My eighth prediction is one I referenced earlier. It’s about self-driving taxis specifically, and the prediction is that self-driving taxis are legit and anywhere that allows them to operate will quickly see them become the norm. I’m speaking from firsthand experience having been to Scottsdale, Arizona, flying to Phoenix, Scottsdale’s right there butted up against it. And I saw ads for Waymo self-driving taxis in the airport, but of course I have Lyft and Uber, and so I used one of those apps to get to the hotel. But then a friend of mine who lives in Phoenix said, while you’re here, you have to try the Waymo’s. He said, it’s all I take now. So download the app and try it. And I did, and Sherry and I rode around in a car with no driver and the steering wheel moves and it takes up one trip. It took me one trip to get used to. It is a super interesting experience to be in there. And you have full control of the climate, so you can make a hotter, colder, you have control of the music, you could feasibly pair your phone, but it was kind of a complicated thing for music. But they had playlists. Of course, it was a bunch of Christmas direct because it was late November. But after doing that, I was struck by just how pleasant the experience was and the fact that self-driving cars are so much safer than human-driven cars is just incredible. And again, referencing earlier in this episode, I went to Google and asked how many traffic deaths, not just accidents but deaths, do we estimate will we reduced by these self-driving cars? And the numbers that quoted were between 90 and 94%. So in the United States for example, there’s somewhere around 50,000 traffic related deaths every year. And a lot of those are from people who it’s driver error, it’s humans being tired, being drunk, being high, making mistakes, unable to see in certain conditions where an autonomous car can see through the rain or whatever. And humans might have difficulty or darkness. And so even if we take the low number of 90%, instead of 50,000 people dying each year, you’re going to have 5,000. It’s an estimate, but even if they’re off by factor of two, it’s just shocking. It’s shocking. And I know there’s a whole conversation just like ai, there’s a whole conversation around jobs, and I get it, and I am totally open to having that conversation, not going to have it in this episode. It is much like self-checkout and much like robot manufacturing, instead of humans putting a rivet in something, robots doing it in a Toyota plant, there’s whole societal impacts that we have to deal with. But put all that aside for this podcast, talking about startups, self-driving taxis are a thing. And if they came here to where I live in Minneapolis, a hundred percent, I would be willing to take them. And in fact, late nights when sometimes I’m concerned that my driver is super tired or the driver might be drunk, I would want a self-driving taxi. And here’s the other thing, I have two teenagers and at times there’s Uber for teens, where as the parent you kind of monitor what’s happening. And so they can call a car, it tells you your child called a car to this location, and they try to give you the highest rated driver, like only 4.9 and up, and they take a bunch of safety precautions. I think they have background checks or whatever. I’m guessing they get more. It’s the premium drivers, it’s a premium service, and then you can see the car the whole time and then you get notified when they get dropped off. But wouldn’t that be even better if it was self-driving? Like the risk of someone doing something that you don’t want to happen goes away because it is a self-driving car that pulls up and they get in and it’s just incredible. Now, do I wish that mass transit was a thing? Yes. Do I wish in more US cities, it was just buses and trains in a lot of European cities that I visited, of course, again, it’s a conversation we can have about how society, how America developed around cars and on and on and on. But self-driving cars are legit. Self-driving taxis specifically are amazing. And then what I’m thinking is my brother lives in the Bay area of California and he has this massive commute traffic’s so bad, and as a result, he bought a Tesla purely for the self-driving because he spends so much time in the car each day, like 90 minute commute each way. Think about it like that. And it allows him to be more present with other things rather than sitting there pushing a gas pedal. But when to true self-driving cars change the game, not just taxis, but my brother could drive and not even need to sit behind the wheel anymore because that’s what Sherry and I were doing in Phoenix. We were in the backseat as the car drove itself. And non taxis meaning just commuter cars that people are driving day to day don’t have that yet. And so when that clicks, how many of those are going to be sold and how many cars on the road will become self-driving? It’s going to be a lot. And I don’t know if 2025 is going to be the year of it, but I think regulation is a big part of what holds this back. And of course, there are also driving conditions like all the testing is being done. It’s usually in on the west coast or the Southwest. It’s not done in the snow, so it may be a very long time until we see them in rougher climates. My ninth prediction is that platform risk will intensify in 2025. There are more platforms to build on. There are larger, more monopolistic platforms that exist. The Shopifys, the Facebooks, the Reddits, and I think bootstrap founders will face increased challenges with platform dependence. And if you listen back to episode 735 of this very podcast, just not even 15 episodes ago, the eight levels of SaaS platform risk, where I talk about the three key factors within platform risk replacement, customer concentration, and lead flow, you will hear that it’s not just one or zero, it’s not just on or off. But I have eight levels where I talk about almost no platform risk relying on a commoditized platform all the way up to aggressive platforms, few replacements, and you have high customer concentration. So what does this mean for entrepreneurs? Well be aware of platform risk, be aware of the types of it, the dangers of it. Know what you are getting into. It’s not to say you should never build on a platform. I think step one and step two businesses can be incredible opportunities for entrepreneurs. As long as you’re aware of what you’re getting into. I would not want to build a 10 year business on any of these platforms. They do not give a shit about you, and they will sooner cut off your API access, say, oops, killed your business. They will build the feature directly into their platform. Oops, killed your business. They don’t care. They’re like Honey badger. They do not care. So know what you’re getting into. If I were starting out trying to get my first app or first couple apps trying to quit the day job, I am all for platforms because I think platforms lend. It’s all the reasons the stair-step method exists. But if I were looking to build my next app to seven or eight figures, I would think long and hard about whether or not I wanted to be on a platform that could take over the whole business, could kill it. Now, realistically, the hard part is this changes because WordPress, I feel like has always been a pretty friendly platform until this year when Matt Mullenweg’s slash WordPress made the decision to be very aggressive with WP Engine and apparently take over plugins. I mean, there’s a whole story there that I’m not going to cover here, but realize that platform risk exists in a lot of places, but it doesn’t exist everywhere in the same level. And you will want to educate yourself, know what you’re getting into as we head into 2025. So thanks so much for joining me today to hear my nine startup predictions for 2025. Some of them are positive, some of them are downright gloomy, but I did want to share these with you as I’ve been thinking about ’em. Thanks for joining me this week and every week.

For the Rest Of Us, I am Rob Walling, and in this solo adventure, I’m going to look back at 2024. I’m going to reflect on some key concepts that I discovered slash introduced on this podcast in the last 12 months. I’m going to reflect on accomplishments, things I was able to ship this year, as well as look back at my top four favorite episodes from the year. And then I’m going to revisit the predictions that I made for 2024 because with only, I’m recording this a few weeks in advance of it going live, but there’s only a couple of weeks left in 2024, and some of these have come to pass and some have not. Before I dive into the episode, I want to let you know about my course that’s SaaS Launchpad, but not just the course because I’ve talked about it on this show before, but the fact that we have added a free sample, a free trial of the course, it’s one of the 27 26 videos that are included in this course. Total course is about nine and a half hours of content, and this is 28 minutes long. It’s called the DNA of a great SaaS idea. It’s kind of my response to the question, if you could design the ideal SaaS product for a bootstrapper, what would be all the aspects that you would want from it? What elements would it have? And I think I came up with 17 or 18 different factors, and realistically, I don’t know that if there’s a single idea that has all 18, but it’s things to think about as you are evaluating your SaaS ideas. So SaaS launchpad.co, if you click the start free button, you will be able to download that video and check out what the course is all about, SaaS launchpad.co. As I’ve recorded this podcast over the years up to almost episode 750 in the course of almost 15 years, I like to reflect every so often, and sometimes it’s in episodes where the episode number ends in two zeros or maybe ends in 50, and other times it’s at the start or the end of a year. So in this episode, I did a quick, it was frankly a cursory look back through the past 12 months, so almost 52 episodes as well as I skimmed through the YouTube channel, although that was even more cursory. And I came up with four concepts that I introduced in 2024 frameworks or concepts. Now, obviously there’s a lot more in the solo episodes where I talk about a herd of bison walking into a storm or normalizing doing hard things. I don’t consider those concepts. Those are just maybe motivational things that come along now and again to give you some inspiration. But when I talk about frameworks or concepts, I mean things like in episode 706 where I introduced the 2 2200 validation framework, and that’s a novel approach to thinking about ways to validate an idea where the two is two hours, that’s where you do some keyword research and go online and look at forums, do whatever else you can do online. The 20 is 20 hours, that’s when you start talking to customers or building a landing page and sending traffic. And the 200 is usually where you get in and build some type of MVP. So the 2 2200 validation framework was introduced just 39 short episodes ago in episode 7 0 6. Another concept that I stumbled upon. And usually what happens is I’m observing all these companies that I’m either advising or invested in or just in the broader MicroConf startup For the Rest Of Us TinySeed community. And I start to see patterns and I’m trying to figure out a way to describe those. And oftentimes it comes when I’m coming to a conclusion and I realize there’s an edge case that isn’t defined. So the second concept of the four that I’ll mention today was when I was looking at horizontal and vertical SaaS, I was trying to evaluate the growth and the difference in growth between the two categories across the tiny C portfolio of now I believe it’s 192 companies. And I realized there was a third type that kind of didn’t fit into either or. It kind of fits into both. And I was trying to think of a good name for it. And I came up with orthogonal SaaS. And so this is where you have a horizontal product, meaning it can be used across any type of business. So it’s not vertical, right? It’s not in a specific niche, but it is aimed at a single job title or a single role at a company. And so I went with all the clunky things like role-based SaaS and title Focus, all these dumb names, and talked about the chat GPT for way too long. And eventually I liked horizontal, vertical and orthogonal. It matches up. And actually, if I drew a diagram, we’re at a whiteboard right now. I could point out to you why it makes sense that it’s orthogonal, but realistically trying to do that a podcast would be terrible radio. So Orthogonal SaaS was the second concept I introduced in 2024. The third one was in episode 735 where I got really fired up about this eight levels of platform risk. And this is absolutely one of my favorite episodes of this year. I was reading X Twitter and I was listening to a podcast, and I get so fucking tired of people saying, well, every business has platform risk because that acts like platform Risk exists or it doesn’t, that it’s a one or a zero that much people think product-market fit is a one or a zero, that it’s on or off. People think platform risk is on or off. And usually this is from someone who’s, it’s often like a no-code proponent, and I’m totally cool with no-code, but realize the pros and cons of no-code. And one of the big cons is platform risk. So when people point that out, the no-code folks bristle and say, well, everything has platform risk because built on AWS, and that’s platform too. But no, no, no, it’s definitely a gradient. It is a spectrum. It is a continuum. And so I sat down and came up with a whole framework around this, and I got seven levels of platform risk. And then WordPress and Matt Mullenweg started to implode and I realized, aha, I think there’s an eighth level of platform risk. So it was a last minute I called an audible and for those familiar with American football terms, and I added an eighth level right before recording it. So I really enjoyed this episode because it was something that seemed to really resonate with people. And I’ve already used it in a few conversations, especially on X Twitter, letting people know that, hey, it’s not binary and trying to put some shape to this because if we don’t talk about it in these detailed terms and isn’t platform risk just this amorphous kind of cloud that you can float through and it’s like, ah, maybe I platform is maybe an owner. Everyone does. So why even think about it? And it’s like because it can kill your business. And I think thinking about it at a deeper level than just saying, oh, it exists or it doesn’t. Really, really helpful for all entrepreneurs and frankly, especially for SaaS founders, as you’ve probably heard me say, my mission in life, the legacy that I will leave behind when I’m no longer here is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups and things like the eight levels of platform risk and the three factors, I think I had three axes that I use to kind of frame that conversation and framework. This is one of those that I think will stick around for years to come because guaranteed to put it into a future book. And then the fourth concept that I introduced in 2024, this one has a question mark. I may have introduced it. 2023 is the 1 9 90 rule. And this is the idea that not everyone should raise venture. Not only should not everyone raise it, but I only think about 1% of venture eligible tech startups should raise venture. I think 1% approximately should consider raising venture. I think 9% should consider raising some type of funding, whether that’s angel investment, something independent funding like TinySeed or Indie vc. And then I think about 90% of those companies should bootstrap. So the 1 9 90 rule is something, again, I may have coined it in 2023, but I know I presented on the podcast in 2024, and it’s something that I similarly think will stick around for years to come. I have a feeling there are a few more concepts I did after I wrote the SaaS playbook, a lot of kind of got my juices flown, and I started discovering slash noticing more frameworks and concepts in late 2023. And then throughout this year, I can almost guarantee you there are more that I have missed. If you think of one, email me questions at startup For the Rest Of Us dot com, I’d love to include it in a future episode. Next, I want to talk about my four favorite episodes, actually five favorite because one of them already mentioned, which was the eight levels of platform risk. That was episode 7 35. Another one of my favorites was 7 28, which is where I talked to Iran Galper and the founder of Gym Desk about his exit. He exited, bootstrapped, took very small amount of money from TinySeed and then exited for more than $32.5 million. An incredible, incredible success story for both Iran and frankly for TinySeed. Next episode is 7 0 6 0.5, where I rethought my most common startup advice. So that was the April Fool’s episode. And decide from you grumpy curmudgeons out there who hate fun and don’t like April Fools. Actually don’t like April Fools either. So I’m trolling you. That episode received the most feedback. I believe of any episode ever in the history of this podcast. Absolutely received the most feedback of any episode last year, but I’m pretty sure of all times. So let’s just plan on doing an April Fool’s episode every year, shall I don’t think I’m going to do that, but I’ll keep you guessing. Next episode, one of my favorites of the year, 729, 9 things I learned investing in more than 190 SaaS companies. I just episodes like this that can present findings or thoughts or patterns that are based on, I guess a unique viewpoint, right? It’s like how many people, I’m actually up to 212 SaaS companies bootstrap, mostly bootstrap SaaS companies that I’m invested in, and there just aren’t that many folks thinking about it like that. And certainly not folks thinking about it in terms of being capital efficient and independent SaaS or being mostly bootstrapped. And so I have more than nine patterns, actually. Yeah, nine things I learned. I think I had another six or seven over on the YouTube channel, so there were probably 15 or 16 that I presented, and of course the list goes on, but I enjoyed that episode. It gave me a chance to sit and reflect on those findings and to try to pull things out that you can’t get out of chat GPT, you can’t get off the internet, you can’t Google this to learn it, right? It’s like things that I’m learning, being in the trenches, doing something that’s a relatively unique experience and a unique viewpoint. And I think that episode turned out great. I actually got a lot of positive feedback about that. And then the fifth and final episode of my favorites of the year is 7 0 9, the seven greatest investments of my life where I talked about from top to bottom, top being the most money I’ve made from any investment, which is selling startups all the way down the list, including crypto, investing in startups, et cetera, et cetera. And kind of took some lessons away from that, but it was something that people said resonated with them so they could hear and get a sanity check because salaried employment was number, I don’t even remember, number six maybe, and running and operating profitable companies was in there, number five, maybe it was a fun episode for me to walk down memory lane, but also something that I think could potentially be helpful to people. So it was one of my top fives of the year. So now I want to reflect a bit on 2024, and then I’m going to look at those predictions that I made. I don’t think I did very well with these predictions. I’m going to look at ’em on the spot. I have not prepared, not prepared. So I better be prepared to probably get two out of seven or something. I dunno how many I made in total, but I want to look back in 2024. And the first thing I want to talk about is how entering 2024, I recorded an episode about how I was basically experiencing burnout, and I took three weeks off at the start of the year, something like that. It was like two to four weeks off to get around the burnout. And also we decided not to do any MicroConf locals. So my travel schedule was cut in half, and I was basically kind of at the edge of I don’t know that I can keep doing any of this. At the end of 2024, it was really fall through, it was through December, and you’re burning out when you start questioning everything you’re doing, and do I even want to be a startup founder anymore? Do I even want to do any of this entrepreneur stuff anymore? And that’s when I know I need to take a step back and recharge and take some time off and kind of clear the head. So that’s where I found myself. I adjusted my travel schedule and the amount of travel reduced it dramatically, probably cut out 75% of my travel. And then I asked myself, what are the things that give me life during the year? And all of this worked. I got through burnout when I came back in January from that four weeks off, two to three weeks, I actually don’t remember how long it was, but I did feel recharged and then I didn’t go back to the grind. I think within a few months of that actually, we went down from one YouTube video per week to one every other week, so it cut that delivery in half, and that was also more of the grindy part of my job. So releasing this podcast, it rarely, rarely feels like work. It’s something I thoroughly enjoy. It’s a creative outlet for me, and I’ve been doing it for almost 15 years now. YouTube is a little bit different. It’s more of a grind, not all the time, but it’s definitely, it feels like work a lot of the time. And so a video every week was taxing. In addition, the channel, the growth really slowed down. We kind of tapped out most of the market, not all of it. We’re at about 91,000 subscribers now, but we plateaued around 80,000, I think it was within a month or two of that January sabbatical, in essence, sabbatical, two to three weeks, no sabbatical, but two to three weeks off that we did decide, Hey, shipping one a week, just it isn’t worth the effort, the time and the money. And so we backed off on that and I think that also thoroughly contributed to helping me get through burnout in 2024. A couple things we shipped from MicroConf this year were MicroConf US in Atlanta. We had Ben Chestnut and Rand Fishkin were there. It was a great, great event. We did MicroConf Europe and Dubrovnik. Both of those events sold out. Europe sold out relatively quickly and was, I believe it was either the best or definitely top two or three best MicroConf Europes that we’ve produced for a number of reasons. The attendees were amazing. The talks just everything came together. The execution was outstanding. So I’m thoroughly looking forward to those two events this year. Well, I guess in 2025, we have New Orleans happening in March. You want to get tickets that it’s approaching sellout at this point, and that is microcomp.com/us and then Europe is yet to be announced also with MicroConf, we launched the State of Independence SaaS report in, I believe it was May or June, and we launched my course, the SaaS Launchpad. I talked about it in episode 730, but I just talked about it at the top of the episode as well. But what an effort. You figure you can record a course in a couple months and get it out, and it was like nine months of a lot of work, and as a result, the quality of that product is outstanding. So it is by far the best course I have ever produced. I’m super proud of it and I’m glad we were able to get it out. A couple more things, the SaaS Playbook, which I did a Kickstarter for, and then shipped the book and started selling it widely in, what was that, June or July of 2023. It has continued to sell very briskly and it caught in past to start small, stay small within a year, something like that. Start small, stay small, has been around for 14 years and sold about. My best approximation is 30,000 copies and the SaaS Playbook hit 30,000 copies in about a year, and it still continues to sell. I haven’t run the numbers in a few months, but it’s got to be at 32,000, 33,000 copies for a self-published book. That’s not bad, given that I keep so much of the revenue. If you buy directly, I keep 97% because Stripe takes some. Amazon is, I think a 70 30 split. Is that right? And then Audible takes 75%. Don’t get me started on Audible, but all that said, yeah, if you’re going to buy the audit book, buy from me directly and get the DRM free MP threes. But anyway, the SaaS playbook has continued to sell well and was a highlight of my 2024 to hit those milestones. And again, to see it hit the hands of so many people. The podcast on YouTube are free. Things that I’m able to put in the world, obviously funded by all the other stuff I’m doing. The Things we sell at MicroConf, the book is very close to free like Kindle or PDF. Go to SaaS playbook.com. You get a DM free pdf. It is 10 bucks and the paperback copy, I think it’s 25 or 30 on Amazon, the audio book is 12 or $13 on Audible, so it is not totally free, but it is approximately free. And given my mission to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups, it feels to me and kind of always has felt this way to me, that writing books is one of the best ways to do that. And that getting a book in someone’s hand, even if it contains some information I’ve already talked about, even if people don’t read the entire book, it just codifies things in a different way than a podcast or a YouTube channel can or pontificating things on social media. I really do see and think books Move the Needle. I know that books have moved the needle for me in my entrepreneurial journey, and I hope that they do for you as well. If you did buy SaaS Playbook or Start Small, stay Small. Speaking of books, my Kickstarter for Exit Strategy, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret ended just a couple weeks ago. As of this episode going live, it successfully funded. I’m recording it before the end of the Kickstarter, but I do know that we have hit the goal. My best estimate, you can go check this because you’re living in the future. My best estimate is it did in maybe to 30,000, 35,000 in that range, which is a third, about a third of what the SaaS Playbook did, which I think I’m both surprised by and not surprised by it. I thought it would do a bit more, but I knew it wouldn’t do as much as the SaaS Playbook. SaaS Playbook is obviously just so much more broadly applicable. SaaS playbook’s also the first book that I have written and released in more than a decade with exit strategy coming basically 18 months later, I figure people are like, Ooh, man, can I really do I really want to read another book by Rob Walling? But anyways, exit Strategy Kickstarter, I am very excited about that book. We’re doing a hardcover print run that’ll be out launching to the broader world here in February, I think, or maybe March at the latest of 2025. And I am excited to see what that book does in the long run. It is an evergreen book, the Can Sell for years and years and years, and I do think it’s going to be one of those like start small, stay small and SaaS playbook that has staying power. As I already said, in 2024, I invested in my 212th SaaS company and looking ahead to 2025 TinySeed tails. People have been asking me, is Tiny Sea Tales coming back? Season five and six are both being recorded, five is almost done. There was a reset. Someone had to start over completely. They lost a co-founder. They had to start over with a brand new idea, and so it just reset the clock. So there was no story arc and I didn’t want to end it with a question mark. And so we’ve just kind of waited and waited and recorded less frequently in order to make, I believe we’ll have nine episodes in Tiny Sea Tale Season five, but we are recording episode nine. Well, it may already be recorded by the time you hear this, and I think we will be pushing that out weekly on this podcast feed as we typically do on Thursday. So you get a bonus episode each week. And it’s cool because it’s heavily edited. It’s got voiceovers for me and it has the music telling the story, and it’s, I think in this case it might be an 18 month journey told over the course of 9 25 minute episodes. It’s a neat kind of NPR Gimlet media type production. At least that’s what we aspire to within time constraints and budget constraints. And that will be coming out here in probably January or February of 2025. And then season six is in the works. And so who knows? I don’t like to promise that, but maybe the fall of 25 if we get it done. Alright, so last thing for this episode, and I’m going to say stick around till next week because I’m going to talk about my predictions for 2025, but as we wrap this episode, I want to revisit the predictions I made for 2024. The first is I commented that there would be opportunity in vertical SaaS and I would say, ding, ding, ding. Heck yes. I’m still seeing that the companies were funding with TinySeed, the folks I’m seeing in Microcom succeeding. Obviously you can still succeed with horizontal and orthogonal SaaS. Vertical SaaS is a great place to be if you are a bootstrapped or mostly bootstrap founder. The second prediction was that SaaS will continue to grow in emerging markets. I’m going to give myself a win on that. Similar, the application volume at TinySeed of emerging Markets SaaS and seeing the ones that we have funded in Latin America that are focused on the Latin American market or other emerging markets like India, et cetera. They have some unique headwinds in terms of pricing. They have unique advantages in terms of how cheap it is to market in those spaces. So giving myself a win here, SaaS will continue to grow in emerging markets, and I’m seeing it this year and probably just predict it for 2025. It doesn’t count. I can’t keep predicting it if it already happened. My third prediction was that Twitter would change hands in 2024. Obviously not. That’s a fail unless it happens in the next two weeks before this episode goes live. My prediction is a big fat zero goose egg. I’m going to roll this one forward. Usually I predict things about two, three or four years before they actually happened. When I ran back through all the predictions since we started, which I think was 2012 or 13, which was the first year we did them, a lot of times the prediction that I made would come true two or three years later. So it was early, and I think that’s the case here. Twitter changes hands in 2024. No, it did not. That is a fail, but I think it will be true here coming up. My fourth prediction was that subscription fatigue will have little impact on the adoption of B2B SaaS. I’m going to give myself a half point on this one. B2B SaaS is starting to see headwinds. I think it’s because of the economy, the uncertainty of the recent election of the fears of a recession. I think subscription fatigue maybe. So that’s why I’m giving myself a half. I guess I am kind of inconclusive on this one. So half point, my fifth prediction was that no code and low code will undergo professionalization, meaning things like source control, version control. We could roll things back and forward better debugging unit tests, and that is a fail. This is something that I do think is going to happen eventually. I just think I’m early. I want this to happen. I want no-code and low-code to be more manageable. And back in the day, 20 years ago when we were writing code code and we didn’t, a lot of us didn’t use version control and we didn’t write unit tests. It’s just we still got it done, but it makes it brittle. It makes it harder to maintain. That’s where I think no code and low code are heading. And I think there are some very interesting opportunities in the professionalization of no-code and low-code. My fifth prediction was about AI and about whether it was just hype or not, because people were saying, do you even still use chat GPT anymore? AI is going to take all the developer jobs and folks even saying it was kind of a fad. So I said, no, it’s going to stick around. It is going to become ubiquitous. It’s going to continue to improve productivity. I said, AI is not going to take a bunch of developer jobs, and I don’t think that it has. I said, AI is going to continue to help devs build faster. And this was before Cursor came out, ding ding, like yes, yes, I talked about there would be real productivity gains from ai, not just for devs. I think that’s certainly been true on my team and word on the street is other folks are experiencing that. So I would say it was right on this one, although I kind of baked a bunch of predictions into this one just about AI in general. I just gave my thoughts of where it was headed. And so there wasn’t a concrete thing aside from things I’ve just read off to you. One of the things I said is that non-obvious AI apps will start to come out. The obvious AI things are, hey, describe something in habit, create an image or a video. And I was figuring that more non-obvious, less obvious AI apps would start to get built as the obvious ones all kind of got scooped up. And if I’m being honest, I don’t think that that happened. So this is where I kind of like, I don’t know. Do I get three quarters of a point? I think I was mostly right on this prediction that I am bullish on AI on the fact that it’s going to help us all be more productive, that I think it’s going to stick around and is not a fad, and that I think it will help devs build faster, which won’t necessarily remove dev jobs. It’ll just help us build more software because man, we have a need to build software faster. Or what my last prediction was, I think Stripe will go public in 2024, and that did not happen. That is a goose egg. This is one of those I’m going to roll in 2025. It’s inevitable. And eventually, you know what a stopped clock is, right? Twice a day, and I think stripe’s going to go public soon. And so I will take a goose egg for 2024, and likely you’ll hear this again In next week’s episode. I want to give you my predictions, my bootstrapper slash related predictions for 2025. So thanks for joining me again this week for a look back at 2024, revisiting some key concepts, my favorite episodes, some other happenings, and revisiting those predictions. It’s great to have you here this week, every week.

In this episode, we talk about the rise of Blue Sky and a r and Tracy wind up making a four figure cash bet about where they think Blue Sky’s going to be three years from now. Talk a little bit about TinySeed and how we are raising our next fund, how Y Combinator backs competitors and more hot take Tuesday topics. Before we dive into that, the SaaS Launchpad course, this is the most comprehensive and best course I’ve ever released on early stages, the very early stages of just getting started. Idea validation, launching, building a launch list, getting to your first revenue. The course is live and we now have a free sample module called the DNA of a great SaaS idea. It’s a 28 minute video. This is 28 minutes of about, I think we have nine and a half, maybe 10 hours total of instructional material as well as dozens of worksheets, checklists, forum where people are discussing the ideas and throwing ’em back and forth. It’s at SaaS launchpad.co if you want to check it out. This is the first and only trial that we’ve offered for this course to give you an idea of the level and the quality of the content because the quality of the content is far, far superior than stuff I’m putting out on YouTube. It is far more in depth and it is a book level depth in a video course with full transcript summaries and all that. So SaaS launchpad.co, click the start free button to download the free sample, the DNA of a great SaaS idea. And with that, let’s dive into Hot Take Tuesday. This week I’m joined once again by Tracy makes on Twitter,  Tracy Osborn:Well, I’m there, but or tracy osborne.com on Blue Sky.  Rob Walling:Ooh, blue Sky. We’re going to get into that in just a moment. And Mr. And our set on Twitter.  Einar Vollset:Absolutely. How you doing  Rob Walling:As well as your real name? Are you on Blue Sky?  Einar Vollset:No.  Rob Walling:All right. Are you going to get on Blue Sky?  Einar Vollset:No.  Rob Walling:All right, so let’s talk about  Tracy Osborn:This. I would bet money you are.  Rob Walling:First topic of the day, is Blue Sky going to do it? Meaning do we think Blue Sky is going to survive and thrive? Tracy, I’d like you do. I need you to steal, man, this argument of Blue Sky because it sounds like you are leaving Twitter in favor of Blue Sky. Talk us through what’s going on.  Tracy Osborn:I am a Twitter OG whenever that year. That was way back in the day and I freaking loved Twitter seven, and it was one of the things that really catapulted my career in tech and I thought I was all in. But I got to say the vibe has changed and the vibe has changed pretty significantly in, it’s been changing for a little bit of time due to certain events with the selling of Twitter and whatnot. But I feel like it’s very different in the last few months. And for me personally, it doesn’t suit my purpose anymore and it’s not a place that I find very fun. It’s not useful for me for my career stuff, and Blue Sky seems to be taking hold. It’s like Twitter in 2007, 2008, and that’s really fun. So I am over on Blue Sky enjoying those early days where people are doing a bunch of little apps and creating analytics and doing little silly things. All the things that you go to be able to do on Twitter with the API stuff, I’m sure it’s going to change and evolve over time, but it just, it’s the kind of thing that I want to be a part of rather than what Twitter has turned into now.  Rob Walling:Got it. So for you it’s a personal preference of the type of social media that you’d like to be part of  Tracy Osborn:And I also feel like there’s an opportunity, might as well make an account. I did one for TinySeed, just I’m going to cross post between TinySeed and Twitter and Blue Sky for the time being because I feel like might as well. And if it does take off then it’s already there and it’s pretty nice to have that in there because Blue Sky, you can verify using your domains, so it’s really easy for people to find TinySeed. It’s just TinySeed dot com. So I feel like there’s some business reasons to do it, jumping on a network when it’s early, but largely for me it is personal preference in terms of the way I want to experience a social media network  Rob Walling:And our V set, what’s the counterpoint?  Einar Vollset:These are all good points. I think I just can’t be bothered to join another thing. I’m like, why do I care? I mean honestly, I’ve been on Twitter since 2007. I think I am on there all the time. You see, it’s changed radically. It hasn’t changed all that much for me. It’s always kind of been a show for years now. That’s what I’m used to. It is what it is.  Tracy Osborn:I mean, you’re in good hands with your posting, so it is. That’s true.  Einar Vollset:And I think certainly it used to be a certain kind of place I think before and it was pretty left wing, it was pretty progressive, it was pretty of a type and I think it’s become more balanced let’s say now than before. And so I think you’re more likely to see things that maybe you don’t agree with than you used to. I feel like it used to be very, if you were a San Francisco type liberal, you get a lot of reinforcement of the things that you believe on the old Twitter versus now you definitely get some of the other stuff. And I don’t know some of the stuff, there’s no doubt that I see full on. I see both communists and Extreme right wing white nationalists on Twitter more than I used to, but I mean it’s always been for me, I just don’t think it’s changed all that much I think.  Rob Walling:And how about Blue Sky? Do you think Blue Sky will gain traction and be around in three years and be bigger than it is today?  Einar Vollset:No, I think it’s just a hissy fit to a degree. And I feel like it’s been that there’s been Threads was kind of the same. What was the other one before that? Wasn’t there another one? Not this Macon Bason. There you go. That was the new thing that was supposed to be a thing, and I’m like, yeah, okay, great. If it becomes a thing, then it’ll be a thing. And I am not saying I’m not going to wander over there, but right now I’m like, look, I only need so much screen addiction. Twitter gives me plenty of that.  Rob Walling:And for me, I think we’ve kind of heard two viewpoints here pro and con, and I’m genuinely the middle. I do have an account on Blue Sky, I’m Rob Walling dot com if folks want to hook up with me there, and I’m more doing it to keep an eye on what’s going on. I am posting some of my Twitter posts over on Blue Sky. I find that the community is much smaller. I know everyone that I’ve followed in essence, which is interesting for now, but the volume over there, it’s just very light. If I open Blue Sky a couple times a day tops, I’m like, oh, I’m all caught up because I’m just looking at the people you follow tab and I only follow hundreds of people. So it’s not just this constant free flowing flow of stuff that I don’t necessarily care about Twitter for me, I don’t care about the political stuff. It just doesn’t bother me either way, left or right. I’m just kind of like whatever. I mean, if something’s offensive, obviously it bothers me, but I’m not seeing an inordinate amount of left wing or right wing or whatever. I’m just seeing. I don’t care about, I’m seeing stuff from whether it’s Elon Musk or some celebrity who posts something or blah and it’s just like, I didn’t follow this person. I don’t give a fuck about this topic at all. So that’s the thing that I’m a little fed up with. So I’m going that there’s the what is there, the four U tab, and then there’s people you follow tab, but then I go to people you follow, there’s a reason. There’s an algorithm that is boring. There’s a lot of people I follow that’s like, man, I really don’t care about what’s going on with you.  Einar Vollset:I’ll say that one thing I have started doing with the following that I had to do when you guys sort of forced onto the four U tab is when you see things that you’re like, it’s stupid, tell it. It does work pretty well. I feel like if you’re just like, I don’t seeing what I see on Twitter, I’m like, whoa. Or X, sorry. Then I think like, well, you’re just not telling it what you don’t like, because it pretty quickly shapes into if you spend half a day looking through and being not interested, not interested, not interested, it does update pretty quickly I would think.  Tracy Osborn:So I have one more point before we kind of evolve the conversation, but I just wanted to bring it back for folks who might be thinking about should I move over and the vibes of blues for folks who are indie hackers, makers trying to share what you’re doing in public. So if that’s something that you look forward to being part of a community of folks, sharing what you’re working on, how you’re building your next indie project and whatnot, then I would say check out Blue Sky. I think that in particular, that area has been really taking off.  Rob Walling:And Tracy, your prediction, do you think Blue Sky will be around in three years and bigger and have more traction than it is today?  Tracy Osborn:I would bet so. I could be wrong, but it feels like it terms of the herd instinct of folks and the herd instinct of tech press and whatnot. There’s more now than there was when Macon and Threads and everything else launched a few years ago, including Blue Sky, which was the two years, I guess Blue Sky has been around for a few years and nothing was really happening. And then finally this magical moment happened where people all of a sudden moved over and they had that inflection point. I think that now makes the service more useful.  Rob Walling:And so just because we want to keep things interesting. Tracy Einar, what are you going to bet? What kind of cash are we going to put on this bet of It’s a three years out, so someone’s going to have to remind us. Reach out. Listen to this episode.  Einar Vollset:I think it should be a hundred bucks.  Rob Walling:Oh, I was going to say a  Tracy Osborn:Thousand.  Rob Walling:Wow. Whoa. Now we’re talking. Yeah. All right. You heard it here first. Tracy Osborn. Thanks. Three years. Wait, AER has to agree to  Tracy Osborn:1,002.  Einar Vollset:Whoa, whoa. What’s the definition of being around here? Because I can see Tracy buying bluesky.com and just spinning up her own little thing three years from now just to get a,  Tracy Osborn:Which bluesky.com is not the network,  Einar Vollset:Isn’t it?  Tracy Osborn:That’s someone else. So I’m sure they’re just  Einar Vollset:Wait minute, wait a minute. Why do they name it bluesky if they don’t own blues sky.com? What is the domain then?  Tracy Osborn:It’s like B sky.  Einar Vollset:What? Actually let’s make it $10,000. This isn’t going to last you into the fucking next year. Forget it.  Tracy Osborn:No, I’m capping out a thousand here.  Rob Walling:So a thousand dollars and yeah, not that it’s around in three years, but that it has significantly more traction. Do you know what’s the daily active users right now? Anyone?  Einar Vollset:I mean it’s Tracy and you guys. That’s two.  Rob Walling:So I just did a quick Google and it says that Blue Sky has 20 million users. That’s not daily active. That’s not monthly active. It says user. So I’m thinking that’s registered account. So what is the definition of in three years, this being around and having significantly more traction,  Einar Vollset:Significantly more, a hundred million.  Rob Walling:I was going to say 50 or a hundred. It’s got to be somewhere in there. If it’s 30 is not it. This is a dying social network. If it adds 10 million in three years, so let’s say a hundred, I like that.  Tracy Osborn:I would also say if Rob Walling posts more on Blue Sky than Twitter, at that point, I would consider it a live network at that point. Wow.  Einar Vollset:Okay. So all I have to do is convince Rob not to post more on there and make a thousand bucks. Hey  Tracy Osborn:Rob, you want to make 500 bucks? Sure deal. Do that to your detriment,  Rob Walling:Moving on. And where is Threads and all this threads? What are you doing, man?  Tracy Osborn:Threads just engage. Every time I open Instagram, it’s like, Hey, let’s look at the thing that make people pissed off so they’re all responding to this. So for me, it’s threat. I mean, I clicked on it a few times. It is interesting. People are like, oh, I was at the airport and Delta screwed me over and I talked to this person and I clicked on those a few times because like, Ooh, I want to know what happens next. And then I realized, wait, it’s just pulling me in by making me pissed  Rob Walling:Off. Exactly. It’s the worst of  Tracy Osborn:Social media. And so Zuckerberg, he just announced, he finally put in, because Blue Sky is taking off, they added an option. So you can just see the folks you’re following on threads. They’re feeling some pressure from Blue Sky and they’re changing threads in response. I think folks are so fed up with threads that I feel like they’ve kind of missed the boat, so to speak.  Einar Vollset:I don’t get it. So the reason I think I didn’t sign up for threads was I have a private Instagram, just family things and you have to use this account. And I’m like, no, I’m not doing that. This is a private, this is why I never signed up for Threads. I just didn’t want to open that Pandora’s box. So why aren’t people pissed off with threats?  Rob Walling:It’s just too algorithmically driven. Everything is engagement based. All the posts you see is people being angry or people doing When I post A, so what are the most underrated guitar solos of all bands from the seventies? And then you want to weigh in, right? You’re like, oh my gosh. Well, obviously Jimmy Page is solo on StarWay to Heaven is just underrated, dah dah, dah.  Einar Vollset:You’re so old. Dude,  Rob Walling:That’s seventies. Are you nearly 60? No, not even close. And so that feels just rude. I wonder.  Einar Vollset:Played rude. There we go. Perfect.  Rob Walling:For listeners who don’t know, I just held up my a RP card. Someone thought it was funny to sign me up for the American Association of Retired People here  Einar Vollset:In the United States. It wasn’t a problem.  Rob Walling:Anyways, it’s engagement bait. It’s just vapid content. It almost feels like just listical type stuff. So I go there, I don’t go there anymore. I’m just like, I don’t need this in my life. It’s not interesting. So let’s move on to our second topic. I hear rumor that TinySeed is raising their third fund, a r vol set TinySeed dot com slash invest. If you are an accredited investor and you want to invest in US companies or UK entities, you want to talk people through what’s going on. We’re just kicking this off.  Einar Vollset:I mean, I guess most people know TinySeed and what it is and why we’re doing it and all that stuff. We’ve been doing it now since 2019, so it’s been half a decade. Unbelievably  Rob Walling:First startup accelerator for SaaS.  Einar Vollset:Yeah, and it’s worth thinking about 2019, what was going on at the time. It was right around the time actually it was Sam Altman now of OpenAI who wrote an article, I think he was YC president at the time or maybe he just left or just starting. He wrote this article saying how to invest in startups. And his main point was don’t invest in anything unless it can be 20 billion. And really TinySeed was sort of a response to that. It was like, look, there’s got to be a different way to help founders who wear successes selling to private equity or strategic for 50 or a hundred or a couple million dollars. That sounds like success I think to most people. And so really that’s what we’ve been trying to do with TinySeed and we’ve been doing it, like I said, we did our first fund 2019 deployed. That was kind of at the time I actually got some advice saying, you should call this your fund zero prototype fund. And I kind of wish I had done, but I didn’t. So it is our fund one. We raised about $5 million. I’m sure our compliance person is going to shoot me now, but our sort of mark on there is we’re at about two two and a half x markup on that fund, which it’s not quite apples to apples, but certainly Carta came out with a venture benchmark report here earlier this year and we’re basically in the top five to 15% of most metrics of venture funds. We’ve started returning capital from that fund. And then we raised our second fund in, well, two funds really. One US focused and one European EMEA focused in 2021 in 2022. And those are also starting to sort of trend the same way. And really this fund, the strategy here is like, look, we think this seems to be working and we’re sort of just looking to keep executing on that strategy. So if this is interesting to people get in touch through that invest page, you’ll eventually end up in my inbox and I’ll reach out and I can share some more information. And like I said, you have to be accredited or a sophisticated investor depending a little bit on the fund and there’s some minimums and some things there, but certainly get in touch and I can describe what we got going on.  Rob Walling:And we’ve invested in a lot of companies approaching 200 B, two B SaaS companies, and so that we’re going to continue investing hopefully at that pace over the next several years. So it’s a really nice way to index in quotes into a lot of early stage B2B SaaS companies. I don’t know of any other place that you can do it. We do it just the ecosystem of MicroConf TinySeed, this podcast and my books and all that. It really has, if you’ve ever been to a MicroConf event in person or online, it’s a unique group of folks and a good chunk of the TinySeed companies come out of folks who are in this community.  Tracy Osborn:I mean, it’s the REDDEST community, the best community out there.  Einar Vollset:Yeah, it is. I think it’s one of those things where it’s like, look, if you believe that sort of B2B SaaS, the mostly bootstrap, there’s value creation there. It is one of the better ways to access that market. It’s hard to do as an individual investor just because it’s so early. You really need to be making enough bets that you have the chance of finding the ones that do really quite well and getting access to that deal flow. And that’s very, very hard to do as an individual investor and probably only a handful of people worldwide could do it in sort of the same way that we do.  Rob Walling:Our third story of the day is TechCrunch article about Y Combinator. It says Y Combinator often backs startups that duplicate other YC companies. Their data shows it’s not just AI code editors. And to give folks background, if you’re an accelerator and you’re investing in a lot of companies, you inevitably will back competitors over time. And at TinySeed, we have also had to face this because you can’t invest in 200 B2B SaaS startups and expect to never invest in two companies that compete, right? So 500 startups has this Techstars yc, they’re all going to have it, but this TechCrunch article where they analyzed the data was interesting. I have kind of mixed feelings about it. I think I’ll probably kick it over to Tracy for first thoughts.  Tracy Osborn:The thing that really resonated with me, particularly because I’m part of the TinySeed applications process and going through interviews and picking folks and sending over offers, is that they specifically called out that they are backing the founders, not necessarily the idea, which is very similar, pretty much what we are doing as well because things change over time. People pivot, they find new ideas, they change their positioning, and folks can already, even if we try to do it based on the companies themselves and try not to back competitors, then eventually they’re going to be competing At some point people are going to, they might pivot, move around, might. Yeah, totally over time. So I thought I really resonated with that part and I was like, okay, good. I mean that we won’t really compete with yc, but it does show how the right person, the right driven person who is all in just executing super fast and doing really good stuff. It’s something we do at TinySeed and YC is doing that as well. But also yc, what are they doing per batch? I guess they’re doing four batches per year now and hundreds per season.  Rob Walling:I think it’s 150 to 200.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. Well at TinySeed we have some competition, but then you step back at yc and then of course they specifically say in the article that even within batches and even within, I forget what they call it, but a cohort with their one partner, they’ve had competitors within that. And I’m like, that’s a little bit too close for me for my comfort with TinySeed. I want people to feel comfortable. This is something I did I had to deal with in 500 startups because I was with another startup doing wedding stuff, and that’s a whole podcast on its own, how awful that was. So I’m always cognizant of that at TinySeed. I’m surprised at YC doing that, but they’re kicking butt, so they must be doing something right.  Einar Vollset:I think it’s hard. One of the points that we make at TinySeed founders too is like, look, even if we had a strict, which we don’t, a strict policy, we would never back somebody who’s competing to anybody, not possible, but companies pivot all the time. It’s almost like a religion just to be like, it’s not working. Let’s do something completely different. And what are you going to do? Say people like, sorry, you can’t pivot into what you want to pivot to because we’re already backed someone doing that. That’s not going to work particularly as a minority investor, but just in general, it’s just like you can’t stop people doing that. Like I said, and the batch sizes are now, I think it’s more than 150 now. I think it is probably a couple of hundred. It used to be for the longer. I think 2020 or 2021 was the high point. It was like 300 or 400 per batch,  Rob Walling:But they were doing two batches a year. Now if they’re doing four, it’s got to be a little smaller. Yeah.  Einar Vollset:Oh, that’s right. Oh, then it might be a hundred or 150. I don’t know.  Rob Walling:So folks have an idea. We back across Americas and emea, we do two rounds per year every six months, and we get about 22 to 30 companies between both of those. So still a good pace, but it allows us to be a lot more hands-on and ideally not back direct competitors within the same batch. That’s kind of something we have been able to avoid to date because that feels like it could be a little bit awkward.  Tracy Osborn:I should mention that if there’s anyone who’s like TinySeed or yc do both. We have a few folks that have gone into TinySeed and then gone to yc. There’s advantages. I say obviously as someone who’s running a TinySeed accelerator program and being very biased towards it, but also my husband went through Y Combinator for different programs like YC is what they do, they kick butt at. And what we do, I think we kick butt at it too, but they don’t necessarily conflict. So if there’s anyone who is like, you know what, I’m looking for an accelerator program in B2B SaaS, we are fans of yc and we do encourage folks who are in TinySeed that feel like that’s the place where they want to go to jump into that, but you’re going to have a very different experience in terms of that. We have a lot fewer founders, a lot of you companies, whereas in YC, you’re going to be one of thousand. But they have other advantages that make up for it.  Rob Walling:And we focus on B2B SaaS. We are some of the best in the world at this. And so if you are B2B SaaS, you’re going to get more direct help. But man, if you want to raise buckets of money, this is going to play a better place than yc easy to raise. Our next story is an article on Swapnil Han’s blog. Sorry about the pronunciation there. We will certainly link this up. Title is procrastination and the fear of not being good enough, and it’s actually a short article. There’s some headings, am I just not good enough? Do I care too much about what others think? Pushing through to be able to ship stuff. The reason I bring this up is imposter syndrome is often talked about in startup space and we see mindset being such a critical element to founder success that we actually retroactively went back. We have our tiny C Playbook, which is seven different modules. We added playbook zero that is all about mindset. And this is a big part of it is getting over imposter syndrome. It’s not fake until you make it because faking it, I have such issues with this online of people faking stuff that’s not real, but it is internally maybe having more confidence than you think you, you should. But people get hung up and they get analysis paralysis and they don’t take action. They don’t know if what they’re doing is right and blah, blah, blah. And that is really what I wanted to call out because I know a lot of founders feel this and I know a lot of founders deal with this as they’re starting their company of not knowing what to do next, not knowing if they’re going to succeed, wondering when everybody’s going to find out they don’t know what they’re doing. So to kick us off and our ep, have you seen this trait in founders and what is your take on getting over it?  Einar Vollset:Yeah, I think it’s actually one of the biggest mistakes you can do as a founder. That’s sort of what I think. And I think not like fear not being good enough. That’s hard. Just get over your fear not being good enough. But I think what it materializes into a lot of the time is like you say, analysis paralysis, needing more and more and more data and favoring analysis over just action. And it’s one of the things that we tell our founders pretty early on and just try to hammer into them. And if I could filter it for this at the interview stage, I would just because I think it’s so important just as having a bias for action and being okay with operating under uncertainty. We had to kick off in Barcelona here a couple of weeks ago and I told this piece then I was like, look, a lot of the time this analysis paralysis or not moving fast enough, not moving stuff tends to be because founders, they really want to reduce uncertainty. They kind of don’t want to spend resources or time worrying that it’s the wrong thing. It’s uncertain whether they’re going to get a payback, particularly if you’re sort of bootstrapped, you don’t have a lot of resources, you don’t want to waste it. But my point that I was making these guys is like, look, you want to embrace uncertainty. That’s what you need. If you didn’t have uncertainty, you’d be dead in the water. As a startup, if you don’t have uncertainty on something, there’s nothing for you to exploit. If there was an market opportunity that had zero uncertainty about it, how to do it or whether it was worth doing, then someone more better resource than you would’ve already done it. And so a startup person as even as a bootstrapper, you want to operate in environments that have reasonably high uncertainty and you don’t want to wish it away. And I think your superpower as a startup founder tends to be tolerating operating uncertainty and making mistakes and still being able to move fast and do things under those kind of conditions. And I think sometimes around founders who sort of wish there was less uncertainty, but I actually think that would be a mistake. I don’t think there is put a gold at the end of the rainbow if there is no uncertainty. I just don’t think it’s a thing. You have to embrace the fact that, look, if you want no uncertainty, you should go get a job. And even that’s not completely uncertain, but you shouldn’t want to be a startup guy if you can’t oral, if you can’t handle that uncertainty and sort of embrace it.  Rob Walling:How about you Tracy? What are your thoughts?  Tracy Osborn:I definitely drink the TinySeed slash Einar.  Einar Vollset:There’s  Tracy Osborn:Another place where I see there’s a side to this. I see in myself I, I’m an information gatherer and I love reading things, everything I can about B2B SaaS and sales and churn and all that kind of stuff. And there’s a paralysis of then knowing what the right way of doing things and being aware of how much work it is to do it the right way. And then I kind of procrastinate because I’m aware of how much work it is. Whereas before when I was just getting into startups, I kind of just flung myself into things. I got things done because I didn’t actually have an awareness of how much work it actually would be. And I was blissfully unaware about of what it could be like to be a founder. And so I was just executing fast and doing the 80 20 and all that kind of stuff. And now it’s a little bit intimidating when the full sales process and all that kind of stuff, rather than just being, getting on the phone with someone. It’s easy to procrastinate when you have too much information.  Einar Vollset:I think sometimes it’s just a matter of I didn’t realize that we couldn’t do it, so I just did it. Actually. It’s like General Patton during World War II famously, or maybe if you’re just a nerd, he got an order not to take to bypass this German city because he was going to take four divisions and they didn’t think it was worth it. And he radio back and says, I took it with two, should I give it back? Kind of thing. So I think there’s a certain amount of that. The ignorance is blissing, but I also think one thing to internalize also is that most doors are two eight doors. There’s very, very, very few things in the startup world that can’t be undone if it turned on out to be the right thing. And it’s just to a degree just kind of try it and see it tends to be the best approach.  Rob Walling:Our last story of the day is about Australia proposing their quote, world leading ban on social media for children under 16 from Reuters. We will link it up in the show notes. Tracy Osborne is someone who has been on social media since you were 16. No, I’m just kidding. But  Tracy Osborn:I mean kind of. I was 11 years old. Was  Rob Walling:It Tumblr?  Tracy Osborn:No, this is before Tumblr. I had  Rob Walling:TI  Tracy Osborn:Had, yes, I owed bed a chat into my website. I had a Terry Brooks fan website and I had a chat on there and Terry Brooks, the author, fans around the world would use my chat and my dad would be like, what are you doing? Are you in a chat room? And I’d be like, no. And I go back to talking to all my friends on the internet. So technically yes, there was some sort of social network that I was probably not supposed to do it that time, but as an adult, as someone who is in her forties, I feel like the internet has kind of updated. I’m curious, Rob, you have kids and I’m curious what you think about this. I don’t have kids myself. I just have my own experience of,  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s interesting and then I’ll pass it to a R as well, because a R has kids under 16. I don’t think social media is good for anybody. I especially don’t think it’s good for kids who are just so much more addictable, which is not a word, but it’s just easier for them to just get hooked on stuff. As you can tell by you, give a 10-year-old an iPad and they’ll play it for 24 hours straight and not eat and not sleep and all that. Not saying adults don’t do that, but it’s definitely the brains are still forming. So I don’t think social media is good. I also don’t think kids having cell phones carrying around all the time is good. And yet I have a 14-year-old with a cell phone and I have an 18-year-old with a cell phone. The question for me is, do I want the state legislating that? I guess if the state does, then that makes it easy across the board because then when my 14-year-old says, but you won’t let me on insert name of Snapchat, it’s like, oh man. But all the other kids do, and if the country bans it, then it’s not an issue for me. Now, do I like the country or my government overreaching and telling me what kids can and can’t do? Well, I mean I guess they do it for alcohol, right, and smoking. And is social media as bad for them as that? It could be debatable, right? They’ve done studies of the high suicide rates. So I overall am probably just fine with governments limiting children’s use of social media. I do think it should be the responsibility of the parents, but I just know so many parents that don’t it much be like, let’s say there was no drinking age minimum and there was no smoking age minimum, that would be a problem. There would be parents that wouldn’t care, wouldn’t enforce, and we’d have 13 year olds, not that we already don’t, but we’d have 13 year olds smoking a pack a day and drinking a bunch. So I do think having the laws and some barriers is not a bad thing for the government to impose. My kids are barely on social media. They’re more like in Discord and they’re in messaging apps where they message friends, but they’re not in public places where they’re posting. They’re not doing Twitter, Instagram to public audiences. Einar Vollset, you have kids under 16. Are they on social media? And what do you think of policy like this?  Einar Vollset:Well, it sort of depends. I define social media, but no, they’re not on social media that I’m aware of anyway.  Rob Walling:That’s the thing.  Einar Vollset:They’re on discord with their friends and YouTube is a constant in my household. So that’s the thing. Yeah, I guess I don’t more the libertarian side when it comes to this. I don’t trust the government to tell me what to do with my kids fuck yourself kind of thing. This tends to be my standard MO when it comes to, I’m like, really? You’re going to regulate this? And this is me having been in academia. Anytime there’s a newspaper piece about what experts found, I’m like, did they now? Okay, I don’t believe you. So that tends to be the thing too. So I’m like, look, good for you Australia. You do what you need to do. But do I think, would I be excited if Gavin Newsom decides to this apply to California? No, I wouldn’t. I would almost be like kids that sign up for social media. But that’s probably more my personality, more anything else.  Tracy Osborn:I mean, I look also back at my 11-year-old self clicking through all the, are you 13 messages on the internet? And I was like, yep. Even though I was 11. So it’s not like it’s hard to get around.  Einar Vollset:No. So I actually only peripherally paid attention to this thing. And the Australia thing is, look, the more concerning thing, and this is again, the more libertarian side of my personality is like, how are they going to enforce this? And the answer is apparently that they’re going to require all Australians to provide identification to access the internet. And at that point I’m like, no, no, you don’t get to do  Rob Walling:It. That’s the problem is these things infringe, right? They start getting real up in your face. Yeah,  Tracy Osborn:They have good intentions, but the outcomes are terrible. Yeah.  Einar Vollset:Yeah. So that’s my view. I’m like, I don’t think so. My personal view,  Rob Walling:Tracy Osborn, if folks want to keep up with you, you are. Tracy makes on Blue Sky.  Tracy Osborn:I mean it is. In my title it says Tracy Osborne parentheses. Tracy makes literally for you, Rob. I put it in there.  Rob Walling:I’m going to say this is not going to die with you. You know that Tracy Osborn dot com on Blue Sky and our vol set while you are in our set on X Twitter, if folks want to keep up with you, they should head to TinySeed dot com slash invest.  Einar Vollset:That’s right.  Tracy Osborn:He’ll be our best friend. If you come with a bucket of money,  Einar Vollset:Buck I money. I’m only accepting pockets of money these days. No small change. A hundred dollars bills only. Yo,  Rob Walling:Thanks for joining me. You too.  Einar Vollset:Thank you.  Rob Walling:Thanks to tracy osborne.com and a r vol set for joining me this week on the show.

This effectively will become the intro and first chapter of the audio book, so you get a free preview of the audio book to see if you might like it. The Kickstarter for this book closes this week on December 12th. You can of course go to kickstarter.com and search for exit strategy or you can follow the link in the show notes. It would be amazing to have your support. This campaign is not doing as well as the SaaS Playbook did, and so every bit helps, every pledge helps, and even if you are not thinking about selling your business today, I believe it is never too early to set yourself up for success, even if it’s months or years down the line when you decide to sell. And this book talks about all this stuff to think about before, during, and after. And the before section is super helpful even if you aren’t thinking about selling today. In addition, applications for the all new MicroConf Connect are closing today. December 10th. MicroConf Connect is our application only membership and we only open applications once per month to ensure everyone who’s accepted is onboarded together in a cohort and that we can give them the support they need. All members who sign up will have access to an Ask Me Anything with me on December 12th. If you miss the application date though, you can make sure to sign up for the wait list. We’re going to reopen applications after the new year. That’s MicroConf connect.com and with that, let’s dive into the intro and first chapter of Exit Strategy. You’re listening to Exit Strategy, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret. Written and narrated by Sherry Walling, PhD and Rob Walling,  Dr. Sherry Walling:Not PhD.  Rob Walling:Well done  Dr. Sherry Walling:Rob Walling Odd Blank Space.  Rob Walling:Thanks for pointing that out. This book has a forward by John Warlow, the author of Built to Sell and several other books about selling your company.  Dr. Sherry Walling:He’s a pretty smart person,  Rob Walling:Very smart. It was awesome to get his forward book is Copyright 2024 by Rob and Sherry Walling. There’s a lot of praise in here. John Warlow, Jason Cohen, Derek Sivers, JJ Virgin, Sam Parr. Ben Chestnut. I think we did good. I really appreciate everyone who wrote us a testimonial.  Dr. Sherry Walling:How much did you have to pay those people to say nice things about this book?  Rob Walling:Exactly. $0 and 0 cents. Did send an email to them though. Really appreciate  Dr. Sherry Walling:That. Thanks y’all for saying nice things about the book and reviewing the book. I mean, a bunch of them actually read the book.  Rob Walling:That’s the dirty little secret right of author blurb. Testimonials is most of those are just because someone and they don’t actually endorse the book, they don’t read it, but I get the sense that most or all,  Dr. Sherry Walling:Most of our people, this book,  Rob Walling:Yeah,  Dr. Sherry Walling:This book is dedicated to Genesis Riley Cook being her guardian parents taught us a great deal about going all in on love and letting go with grace. So let’s jump in. This is the introduction. The last days exiting your business with intention. It feels like I’m going through a divorce. This is the most stressful thing that’s happened to me outside of my wife getting cancer. Is it reasonable to feel like this is one of the most difficult parts of my life? These thoughts are not what you would expect to hear from someone in the midst of an event that will leave them millions of dollars richer, but we hear them all the time. Different wording, different dollar amounts, the same sentiment I’ve been working my whole life for this moment. Why is it so painful? Selling your company is one of the most fragile points in the life of an entrepreneur. It is a messy psychological process, often accompanied by an implosion of identity and emotional stability. It requires an extraordinary amount of focus over a long period of time. It disrupts your sense of meaning, your sense of accomplishment and your vision for the future. It’s extremely challenging for your personal and professional relationships. Exiting a business is a transformational experience that few people have Beyond the headlines and highlight reels, there’s sparse conversation about how to do it well. We have a few models to describe the nuts and bolts of the process, but none to guide the deeply personal aspects of a monumental deconstruction and reconstruction of one’s life. We call an exit transformational because it involves change at every layer of life. From the way you introduce yourself to how you begin each morning, what your bank account looks like and the fears that keep you up at night building and then leaving a business is emotionally similar to raising a child who heads off to adulthood and inadvertently fires you from the day-to-day tasks of parenting. You can do everything right and have a wonderful outcome for all your labor and still feel deep emptiness and disorientation. Like any good story, your business has a beginning, a middle, and an end. There’s the seed of a dream that kicks off the adventure. There’s the arc of the story complete with try fail cycles, emotional peaks and valleys and plenty of high stakes, and then there’s the big finale, the exit. You will exit your business. You might sell it. You might go public and get voted out by the board. When you don’t hit your quarterly targets, you might shut it down either by choice or because you feel the story arc has finished or because you run out of money. You might choose to step into retirement and hire someone to take over day-to-day operations. You might die and leave the spreadsheets and shipping deadlines to be decoded by your co-founder, COO or spouse. One way or another, your relationship with your business will end and although there are several ways this relationship can end, this book focuses on exiting via a sale. This is the exit most entrepreneurs aspire to achieve, one that warrants significant preparation and planning. Every founder knows this intellectually, but if you think about their exit until it’s too late and no one is prepared for how hard it’s going to be, the good news is that you get to shape the story arc of your company. You get to participate. Are you writing the story or is this story writing you? There are plenty of books about major life transitions from aging to divorce to empty nest. The sheer volume of self-help and practical guidebook speaks to how difficult and momentous these major midlife shifts are for the human psyche. However, few books prepare you for selling your company. Of course, exits are not nearly as universal as kids leaving home or the slow transitions of aging, but for the millions of people who identify as entrepreneurs, some kind of exit is inevitable. This significant and disruptive experience in the life of the business owner is not given the thought or attention that it deserves. Exits are complicated. They are financially and legally intricate. They are incredibly stressful. There are many relational implications. They also rearrange a founder’s identity in deeply felt and widely sweeping ways. No matter where you are in the process, it’s important to prepare yourself for your exit to achieve your optimal outcome. You must be mindful about setting yourself up for the exit trajectory most congruent with your goals. Exits are not magic. They don’t just happen one day when the money wizards stops off at your office with a wheelbarrow full of cash. They are usually the result of careful planning and thoughtful decision-making. Failing to prepare can result in many complications even if you do achieve your optimal outcome and sell to someone you trust. For buckets and buckets of money. A simple truth remains. Selling is one of the hardest experiences of a founder’s life.  Rob Walling:When we tell this to entrepreneurs, they rarely listen. They nod and they smile politely. They hear what we’re saying, but they don’t really listen. After all, every part of entrepreneurship has been challenging and if they’re going to sell anyway, what does it matter that it will also be hard. We’re not telling you this to scare you off. You already know selling will be hard even if you don’t yet know how hard and who better to prepare you for this difficult journey than a clinical psychologist specializing in entrepreneur mental health and a serial entrepreneur with 20 years in the trenches supporting founders through the full scope of the entrepreneurial journey.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Hey, that’s us.  Rob Walling:That is us. Between the two of us, we’ve seen hundreds of founders through their exits. Dr. Sherry has been helping entrepreneurs with their mental health relationships and big decisions since 2016. Prior to this, she spent 10 years helping people put their lives back together after trauma loss and major disruption. She has deep expertise in grief along with personal experience coming back to life after a significant loss. For more on this, check out her book Touching Two Worlds.  Dr. Sherry Walling:As the co-founder of MicroConf for TinySeed, Rob has worked with thousands of founders across all stages of business. He has also started six yes, six companies and gone through multiple exits including his successful and wildly stressful exit from Drip.  Rob Walling:Did you roll your eyes when you said six companies? Like each one of those took years off your life?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah. I can name all of my gray hairs and wrinkles after the companies that  Rob Walling:After each of the companies, our first book for startup founders, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Keeping Your Shit Together, how to run your Business without letting it run You helps you navigate the beginning and middle of your business’s story arc. This book is about nailing the big finale. In writing this book, we aim to shine a light on the path before you so you can see the challenges and pitfalls ahead. We can’t make those challenges and pitfalls easier, but we can prepare you to face them. Our goal is this to help you protect your family, your relationships, and your mental health while working toward the best possible exit for you and everyone in your company. This book offers frameworks to simplify the complex mental, emotional, and relational challenges of exiting. It draws on the combined wisdom of thousands of founders we’ve coached, talked to, laughed with, cried with, and advised over the years.  Dr. Sherry Walling:You’ll also hear firsthand lessons from Rob’s own experiences selling his companies and my experience during him on as well as insights gleaned from interviews with other entrepreneurs about their exits.  Rob Walling:Finally, we provide practical strategies to help you exit well. We will touch on the elements of a deal and some basics of negotiation, but this book focuses more on the space between your ears than the line items in the contract. For detailed guidance on deal structure and company preparation, see our resources at the end of this book for well-crafted, practical content about preparing your business for your departure. Whether you’re selling an e-commerce company, a children’s brand, a trapeze franchise, a consulting agency, or a software as a service or SaaS business, we’re here to help you prepare. Every exit is unique and there’s no such thing as a game plan that will lead you through all the steps. As the Spanish poet Antonio Machado wrote by Walking the path is made and when you look back, you’ll see a road never to be trodden again. No one can tell you how to walk the path, but we can equip you for the journey. Let’s get started.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Let’s get started. Section one of the hardest things you’ll ever do. Chapter one. Why is this so difficult? Julie Ellis and her three co-founders hadn’t intended to sell their beloved children’s label company Mabel’s labels, but when one of the largest companies in their space made a $12 million offer, the four co CEOs decided it was time the business structure of four co-founders with equal decision making power was starting to feel too slow for the rapidly growing company Julie told us in an interview, yeah, that makes total sense to me. For people making decisions is a lot. Plus, after 13 years of pouring all their resources into building the business, the sale would provide each of them with a nice nest egg for retirement. There comes a time when getting your money off the table starts to look pretty appealing. She said the timeline was aggressive less than six months from the first talks to the closing date, but the acquirer checked the boxes. Julie and her co-founders wanted checked. They were Canadian owned and would let Mabel’s labels keep running on its own rather than dismantling and absorbing it. It seemed like the perfect situation, but Julie quickly learned how exhausting selling a business could be. The exhaustion only grew as she went to work for the acquirer immediately after the sale and realized that the marathon finish of the acquisition was actually the starting line for a new kind of race. Six months after the sale closed, she left the business. She thought she would never leave exhausted and uncertain about her next direction. As entrepreneurs we’re always climbing for a pinnacle, Julie said, but there’s always another pinnacle after the first one and another one after that, and many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of dismissing or diminishing their accomplishments. We have an inability to find a plateau and rest on it. For a little while, said Julie. For Julie, the exit was a vast plateau. It should have felt like a victory, an opportunity to rest, but her entrepreneurial mindset was trained to keep pushing for the next accomplishment. Sitting on that plateau sparked an avalanche of new questions. Is this the best I will ever do? What will happen next? Was it a mistake? Even when an exit is going smoothly? The untold story is that many founders experience a significant mental implosion during and after the process. It’s possible for something very good to happen while still feeling a lot of emotional turmoil or conflict. These emotions can coexist. Talk to anyone who’s had a baby gotten married or started their dream job, and you’ll often hear that the joy was accompanied by a sense of inner disorientation. Exiting is an emotionally tumultuous event and it’s worth taking the time to prepare your mind as well as your business. We are not trying to scare you, but time and time again entrepreneurs have said how surprised they are that selling their company is so hard. If you go into it with eyes wide open to the challenges and armed with strategies to get through them, you’ll be miles ahead of someone who’s going into it with the magical thinking of signing some documents that yield a personal bucket of money and a room full of elated employees, friends and family members. So let’s start by digging deeper into the psychology of what makes this process so difficult.  Rob Walling:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates, and they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it. Listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results and longtime listener. Chaz Yun hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his higher quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used Lemon IO again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. Your business is your baby. Entrepreneurs are deeply connected to their businesses and a study of entrepreneurs, emotional experiences and neurological activation. Scientists used functional MRIs while asking entrepreneurs to think about an image of their business. They conducted the same experiment with parents asking them to think of an image of their child. When comparing the brain activity of both groups, they found remarkably similar activation patterns. Specifically the study showed that activity was suppressed in regions of the brain involved in critical assessment. Specifically, the study showed that activity was suppressed in regions of the brain involved in critical assessment, while it heightened in areas associated with the brain’s reward center. In real world terms, this means that entrepreneurs and parents experience a similar sense of delight and satisfaction when thinking about their beautiful, perfect, above average children or businesses. Whether we’re thinking about our children or our businesses, our perceptions are not entirely objective. Both entrepreneurs and parents tend to view their subjects with a positive bias rather than objective clarity. Running with the parent analogy, you may rationally understand that your relationship with your children will change as they mature. You may also know that the goal of parenting is to raise autonomous independent individuals who do not live in your basement. Our 8-year-old moved out, went to college and currently lives in our basement, so this one hits a little close to home.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Whoops, we might not be very good at this.  Rob Walling:You may even be emotionally ready for your 18-year-old to leave home to preserve everyone’s sanity. However, understanding this doesn’t make the transition any less emotional or challenging. It’s not so different with a business. If you’ve built it well, there will come a time when the business outgrows you, but neurologically speaking, entrepreneurs often don’t perceive a clear separation between themselves and their businesses. This means that no matter how you pride yourself on being, it’s incredibly difficult to see yourself and your business objectively during and after your exit. When you commit so much of your time and energy to the formation and growth of a business, it is perfectly natural for the business to become an extension of your identity. You intertwine yourself and the business and other people may see you and the business as intertwined. Those years of intertwining get unraveled in an exit, A topic we’ll explore in the latter half of this book, there are psychological pros and cons to thinking of your business as your baby. Generally speaking, it isn’t a great idea to tie your wellbeing to an external entity that is highly vulnerable. Just social media algorithms or the supply chain from China. Too much of your identity is wrapped up in things you can’t control, but regardless of whether or not it is optimal, the neural imprinting between a person and their business is substantial and consistent.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Another reason it’s difficult, you’re entering the unknown. Businesses tend to grow slowly. You have the seed of an idea and then spend months or years on your own building it into something people want. You create your team slowly refining your product and growing your company until you suddenly look around and realize you have 20 people working for you. And then in a move that can feel like it happens overnight, you begin an exit process. You find yourself in a new location, a new world. The sudden shift is disorienting to say the least.  Rob Walling:Here’s a quote from a post exit founder. As a first time founder, it’s scary. Giving up a business is going well and recognizing whatever good fortune that allowed you to thrive might not be repeatable.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s not just the suddenness of an exit that’s disorienting. It’s also the potential loss of your identity, direction, and purpose. Returning to psychology, if you consider the typical progression of human development, we see rapid changes in our early lives. We try on adolescent identities, a jock, a punk, a goth. Oh yeah, I like the breakfast club. We leave home for college, perhaps switch our career paths a few times. We enter into and leave intimate relationships. We establish ourselves professionally. We purchase homes and couches to cats in a fish tank. We might have children. We start companies. As we age, the rate of these life-changing events slows down. We can no longer move apartments in one afternoon with our cousin’s pickup truck. We grow comfortable with our stable lives and identities. Mature adulthood means that generally we know who we are and how our life operates, and then we face an exit and we’re thrown into the unknown once more because of the depth of the relationship between the entrepreneur and the business. This is not a casual unknown. It is a deep unknown, a fairly comprehensive recalibration of who we are and how our life works. Most dramatic life-changing events that happen in the middle of adulthood are traumatic, like a car accident, a divorce, the death of a parent. What comes after the can be daunting. The exit creates instability and unpredictability, and after years of leading and directing the path of your business, it requires you to surrender control. It can feel like going backwards.  Rob Walling:Here’s another quote from a post exit founder. It’s not often as a 43-year-old, I have a major life decision. Most of what we want at this point is predictability, and the uncertainty of what comes after this is daunting.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It can feel like you’re 18 again and wondering what the hell you’re going to do with the rest of your life.  Rob Walling:On top of all that, going through an exit is incredibly isolating. Think of it like an iceberg. The tip of the iceberg is the public perception of what you’re going through. Everything below the water is what you’re actually experiencing from the perspective of your employees. Team members and the public exits are seen as times of celebration. Pop out the champagne and the celebration emojis because now you’re a millionaire, right?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Which is the celebration emoji.  Rob Walling:There’s a confetti one, and then there’s one that looks like a bullhorn with confetti around it. I think if you type in colon confetti, oh, that’s in slack anyways,  Dr. Sherry Walling:Alright,  Rob Walling:And while that’s partially true because getting millions or tens of millions of dollars wired to your bank account is a pretty incredible moment, that’s only the tip of the iceberg. The rest is an incredibly nuanced experience that the founder goes through alone. You’re trying to make the best decision for yourself and your business processing a complicated multivariate analysis in your head, and often you might be legally barred from talking about what you’re working on. When I sold Drip, I experienced a barrage of congratulations. While mentally I was almost at my breaking point. This created a deep sense of disconnection because it was nearly impossible to talk about the realities of the exit due to non-disclosure agreements or NDAs and the dearth of people who could relate to my experience. Exiting is a low frequency event. There just aren’t that many people who’ve done it. Many other major life transitions are universal puberty, completing high school, choosing a life partner, pregnancy, the death of a family member, a child departing home and aging. They’re challenging shifts, but almost everyone has experienced them. There’s plenty of collective wisdom and guidance available to help you navigate these difficult transitions, not so with an exit. It’s a pretty small club and you have to work hard to find commiseration guidance and support as you enter this unknown territory  Dr. Sherry Walling:And there’s no blueprint. Another factor that adds to the feeling of isolation is that there’s no blueprint. Exiting is like a fingerprint. No two look exactly the same. As we mentioned, exiting is a low frequency event. It’s also a high variability event, which means that even the few other people in the world who have gone through an exit haven’t gone through your exit. If you and I both decide to sell our houses today, there’s a relatively standard process to follow. It’s a high frequency, low variability event. Sure each home is unique, but millions of homes are sold around the world each year. Even if you haven’t sold a house before, you probably know a dozen people who’ve been through the process and there are standard templates you can follow selling a business. On the other hand, each experience is unique. Maybe you’re part of a mastermind or run in entrepreneurial circles and even have other friends who are founders, even if that’s the case, and even if some of them had gone through their own exits, the chances that someone has gone through your exact scenario are very low. No one can hand you a blueprint for exiting your business. The number of variables is just too great and there’s never one right answer. When selling your company, your hand sketching your blueprint while the backhoe digs the foundation  Rob Walling:And all that got you here, won’t get you farther exiting well requires a new set of skills. During the course of running your business, you’ve learned how to build, how to sell your product, how to market, how to lead your team, how to build a profitable company. None of those skills apply to what you’re about to do. In fact, the main drivers that got you to this point, your passion for your product, your commitment to your team, your dedication to your business can stand in the way of a successful exit. Many entrepreneurs have difficulty making clear decisions during a sale because they care so much about their team and their business. You’ve spent years or decades building something incredible and developing the passion to run it. After all, everyone’s got the cutest baby right now. Not only do you have to go through one of the most difficult and isolating times of your life without a blueprint, but you also have to unlearn old habits and teach yourself a brand new set of skills  Dr. Sherry Walling:And it’s irreversible. If you hire the wrong engineer, you can fire them and find a better fit. If you develop a feature that turns out to be a dud, you can always scrap it and try something new. If you invest in a marketing approach that turns out to be a waste of money, you can also change course. Those are reversible decisions. You can make them relatively quickly without too much stress. Exiting your company though is irreversible. Sure, we’ve all heard of people who repurchased a company after they sold it, just like we’ve heard of couples who got back together after a divorce. But both situations are pretty rare. Because of this, it’s not a decision you should make quickly. It should stress you out. You should spend a lot more time thinking about it than you did thinking about who to hire for that engineering role. The decision is irreversible, so you should make damn sure it’s the right decision, except  Rob Walling:You can’t see the future, which means there’s absolutely no way to know if you’re making the right decision. All you can know is that you’re making a decision, which is hopefully the best decision you could make with the data you have. You can run various calculations and imagine what life might look like if you continue to grow the business for another 20 years versus selling it now and walking away with a specific dollar amount. However, you can’t actually know how any of these scenarios will ultimately turn out. We know founders who wish they hadn’t sold, founders who felt like they sold for too little, and founders who declined an offer that in retrospect was a once in a lifetime deal. There are many potential scenarios for regret. With the benefit of hindsight, they might have made a different decision. None of us can see the future though. The only thing you can do is make the best decision you can with the information you have right now.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So now let’s shift to six factors that shape how you feel about an exit and our experience working with entrepreneurs. Six factors strongly predict the emotional process of an exit. So we’ll discuss these factors throughout the book. The first one we want to talk about is motivations. The reasons behind your decision to sell the company significantly impact how the process will affect you mentally. Are your motivations purely financial? Are you seizing of lucrative market opportunity or strategic acquisition? Are you feeling called to shift into different or more meaningful work? Are you selling off one product to concentrate on the success of another, or are you selling somewhat reluctantly due to unexpected life changes, burnout, fatigue, or depression? When you understand your motivations, it helps clarify what a successful exit looks like for you regardless of your situation. It also helps you gauge the emotional reserves you have available for the exit process. Beginning an acquisition process while experiencing burnout is like running back-to-back marathons. It’ll be highly emotionally challenging. It’s crucial to be aware of your energy levels and core needs as you navigate the process.  Rob Walling:The second factor is tolerance for uncertainty. If you started a business, then tolerance for uncertainty is your bread and butter. But as we’ve mentioned, the level of stress and uncertainty during the exit process is a whole new ball game. Founders who have a high tolerance for uncertainty will have an easier time during their exit, but even if that’s you, it will require all of your coping skills to rise to the challenge. It’s worth assessing those coping skills. Now, take stock of the ways you tend to deal with uncertainty, both positive and negative, and create a plan for implementing or mitigating them during your exit.  Dr. Sherry Walling:The third factor is good old fashioned stamina. Exits take longer and are more complicated than anyone imagines at the outset. Even if you have a fantastic strategic buyer and the purchase price is agreeable and the details seem to be lining up, it always takes longer than it should. There’s a lot of paperwork. There are many people, employees or customers who need to be brought along strategically with thoughtfully crafted information. Pace yourself and prepare yourself mentally to run a marathon.  Rob Walling:The fourth factor is team psychology. The way an entrepreneur views their team is another critical factor. What is your relationship like with your team? Do you see them as family? Are they literally members of your family, friends from high school? Are they a curated workforce that you’re paying to do their jobs? How do you see responsibility to them when you’re setting yourself up to exit? Hopefully with a nice pile of money, your existing relationship with your team will significantly impact how you feel about exiting.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Number five, identification with the business. How closely do you identify with your business? Whether you built it from scratch over decades or have been running it only a few years? At least part of your identity is probably closely tied to your company. As you consider your exits important to find meaning and engagement in other areas of your life, your hobbies, family, community, and other passions. Exiting a company can feel like cutting off a limb, but founders who have found a meaning in other parts of their lives tend to have an easier time. The earlier in your business journey that you begin to separate yourself from your business, the better for you and for your business. You may want to ask, how well can this business run without me? The business may be more valuable. It almost certainly will be more valuable if it isn’t tied to you and you are healthier pre, mid, and post exit. If your sense of worth as a human being isn’t intertwined with your business.  Rob Walling:The six factor is a sense of what’s next. It’s easy for a founder to get so wrapped up in the exit process that they’re not thinking about what comes after. However, it’s healthier to start thinking about future plans and gently engage with those plans as early as possible. We use the word gently because rushing into a plan to offset the uncertainty can be problematic. Instead, approach it with a sense of exploration. Gently noodle through ideas. Don’t solidify them by pouring concrete. The question of what’s next can either haunt you throughout the exit process or serve as a north star that guides you into the next phase of your life.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So at the end of each chapter, we decided to make these little sections called making it real, and in ’em they’re kind of like practice assignments. These parts of the book where we want to translate the content of the book to something that you can actually use and apply to your life. So for this first chapter, the Making it Real section says, start your exit journal. Grab a notebook or open a password protected document and write down what a good exit would look like for you in this exercise. Practice active imagination. Close your eyes and imagine your last day at your company. Imagine some last act like locking your office door, closing your laptop, offering a goodbye hug to one of your team members. In your imagination, examine yourself. How old are you? What is your emotional state? How do you feel about this ending, this last act? And now let’s jump scenes. Imagine you are telling an old friend about the last day at your company. Imagine that you are happy, proud, satisfied that your exit went exactly as you’d hoped. What’s the story that you tell them? Who was the acquirer? What was the sale price? Where are you taking your loved ones for a celebration? Now, begin to imagine yourself in this scenario. It is one way to practice a not yet experienced reality,  Rob Walling:And we wrap up chapter one with a sidebar titled, think About Your Exit Before You Get Started. Ideally, you’ve been thinking about your exit since day one. A good exit strategy is like a prenup in a marriage, especially if you have a co-founder,  Dr. Sherry Walling:Hey, do we have a prenup?  Rob Walling:No, our net worth was like $8,  Dr. Sherry Walling:But I had a guitar.  Rob Walling:That’s true. $8 plus a guitar. Entrepreneurs who have never thought about it usually find themselves blindsided three, five or 10 years into a business when life circumstances change, they get tired of the business or they get an offer with a shocking number of zeros. Everyone exits. If you don’t plan for it early enough, you’ll find that your business isn’t prepared to go on without you once the day comes. And if you don’t think about yourself exiting, you’ll be emotionally jarred when you find yourself pondering. Now, what do I do with myself? In your mind? Begin to see an exit as a universal stage in the lifecycle of any entrepreneur. Make it the assumption, the default setting, not to get too dark about it, but a helpful analogy is thinking about exiting your business, like making sure your affairs are in order for the end of your life.  Dr. Sherry Walling:That is dark, dude. Nobody’s going to die.  Rob Walling:Nobody’s going to die.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Oh wait, whoops.  Rob Walling:People are depending on you to leave your business in good shape. If you suddenly need to leave, there’s no way around death. Taxes and exits. Have an ongoing open dialogue with yourself and the relevant people, even if it’s just a password protected document where you can jot down thoughts and explore your exit ideas from time to time. Whether or not you can visualize the end of your relationship with your company, start having that conversation with yourself today. Don’t wait until you’re forced into it without having enough time to think and plan. You might miss an opportunity because you were unprepared to seize it, and definitely don’t wait until you’re in the middle of stress and burnout to make some of the most important decisions of your business life. Though, if that’s you, we’ll walk you through that process too.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Hey, good job reading.  Rob Walling:Yeah, you too.  Dr. Sherry Walling:You read. Good.  Rob Walling:Thanks for joining me on the show. I know I grew up reading and writing and arithmetic and  Dr. Sherry Walling:Speaking English.  Rob Walling:Speaking English. Well, thanks for joining me on the pod here.  Dr. Sherry Walling:My pleasure. Thanks for writing a book with me.  Rob Walling:How’d it feel reading that first chapter? We have not read the book out loud. It really well.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I just gave a talk about the content of the first chapter, so I didn’t read the book, but I actually used some of the language verbatim, so I felt like, oh, I’ve have actually read this out loud before.  Rob Walling:Did you just say I haven’t read the book, the book that we wrote?  Dr. Sherry Walling:No, I haven’t read it out loud.  Rob Walling:Oh, got it.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’ve read it multiple times.  Rob Walling:Like proofreading. Yeah,  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah. But I have not read it out loud. It’s not been the book that our children have requested for their night night pre-B bedtime story being as they’re 18 and 14.  Rob Walling:I think it felt good. It holds up. It’s always a different experience reading something out loud.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, I mean, other times that I’ve done this, I’ve really wanted edit things as I’m reading it, it feels clunky or like, no, that’s not how I want to say that. But I made a few little wording adjustments as I was reading, but generally speaking, I think the writing is quite good.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I’m the same. Every audiobook I’ve ever read, I have made edits to the manuscript as I’ve been making it because there’s just certain things that you find are clunky or I believe in the very read through the SaaS playbook, there was one sentence where it was missing the word not, and so I said the exact opposite. It was probably something like, you should definitely do B2C or something like that, and I was like, what has to be not, I cannot print this book. People think it’s an April Fool’s joke.

I’m on a solo adventure today and I’m going to be covering topics ranging from normalizing, doing hard things about just getting used to doing hard things about how bisons walk into storms. Not sure if you’ve heard about this, but it’s an interesting adaptation they’ve developed over hundreds or thousands of years, and then about making it work, making it right, and making it fast. Before I dive into that, the Kickstarter for my new book Exit Strategy, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret is Live and it closes next week on December 12th. You can head to the link in the show notes or you can go to kickstarter.com and search for exit strategy. The book is 260 70 pages of all the knowledge that my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling, who is a founder and executive coaching consultant and myself have gathered over the past couple decades of working with entrepreneurs, advising them, investing in them and having had an exit or two ourselves. So you can head to exit strategy book.com and also get a link to the Kickstarter there. It would mean the world to me if you’d back it. And also I think that everyone, whether you’re just starting out or whether you’re thinking about exiting or in the middle of exiting, can use some mental support, psychological support and really learn from not only Dr. Sherry and I, but the 15 or 20 entrepreneurs who have exited that we interviewed for this book. So I’m really proud of what we put together and I think for $30 it’s quite this steal in terms of the amount and the quality of the information that you’ll gather from it. In addition, MicroConf mastermind applications close on December 4th. You’ve heard me talk about Mastermind’s ad nauseum on this podcast about the tremendous impact that they’ve had on my entrepreneurial career, not only in the moment, but just keeping me going for the past couple decades. MicroConf masterminds.com if you want to get matched with like-minded founders who are bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped but ambitious and looking for accountability, friendship, comradery, and frankly just looking to not feel so alone. So that’s microcom masterminds.com. Let’s dive into my first topic of the day. I want to tell you a story about a trip that my track team took to Hawaii in high school. I think I was a junior and this was a big deal. None of us had ever been to Hawaii and we went out there to compete in an invitational type thing, but we had to do fundraisers and such to afford the tickets and all that. And while we were out there one day, my coach was driving the rental car back to the hotel and the hotel was surrounded by, I think it was all sugar cane if I recall correctly. And there was this long road, of course it’s Hawaii, so there’s a mountains on this side and a beach on this side and just this amazing vista. But he’s driving back to the place that we were staying at and he sees one of the distance runners running the other direction running away from the hotel, and he’s just kind of trotting along and his name’s Brian. And so coach pulls up and he says, Brian, where are you going? And he says, I’m running down to this convenience store to get ice cream. And the coach says they have ice cream back at the hotel. There’s a refrigerator thing where you can buy it in the lobby. And Brian says, yeah, but they don’t have chocolate chip. And my coach told that at the end of year event, the reception where parents get together and talk about track and give people awards and all that, and I got a huge laugh from all the parents because the convenience store was a couple miles from the hotel and us track athletes. We looked around. I don’t get why that’s funny, and I get the joke now. It’s that wow, as an adult would you run two miles in order to get a thing of ice cream that is the flavor that you want? And most of the time, no you wouldn’t. But the thing was is when you’re running at that level, we were competing at a pretty intense level. I’ll say I wound up, I’ve talked about this, but I wound up breaking the school record in the hurdles and that record lasted 31 years. It just got broken this year about four months ago. So we were not dabbling in track. We were very, very intense about it, and as such, we had normalized doing hard things. There was such second nature that most of us didn’t get the joke when the coach told that story at the end of your reception. And the thing about it was our workouts were a mile warmup. Then you do some stretching and then you do a pretty intense workout of sprints and intervals and you’re dying at the end and then you do another mile cool down, you stretch and you leave. And that’s just what we did five days a week, sometimes six days a week. There were obviously days when I threw up once a week during the fall for a few months As you’re getting into shape, it’s just so intense and that was just what we did. We would groan when they would name a particularly hard workout, but we all showed up and we all did it, and the people that performed it was just expected that if we wanted to do great things, we had to do hard things and usually we had to do the hard things first. It was getting in shape and it was working on our technique and it was sometimes running ourselves to the point of throwing up, unfortunately, but in the end of the season when you’re trying to qualify for regionals and the state meet, you were thankful that you did the hard things in the early days, and there were some folks that came to the first month or two of track and it was hard and they said, you know what? This isn’t for me and that’s fine. It was a way of I guess weeding folks out and really only having those that cared enough to do the hard things that were really committed to the long-term vision because talk about delayed gratification, and I guess I should clarify, in high school it was only about, was it maybe five months? So it was probably from January to June you started working out and then you had the state meet in June in college was when there was fall workouts, and that went all the way through June, so it really was a full nine months or so of doing hard things, so to speak, and you kind of did it every day and got used to it. The reason I’m bringing this up, of course, in the context of startups is a lot of the founders that I see succeeding if they’re not relying on luck and they are the ones who are executing and building skills and putting in hard work, it’s just expected that you’re going to have to do some hard things. And sometimes that hard thing is digging into marketing approaches that don’t work right away or maybe that you’re like, I don’t really want to do that. Do I have to do SEO? I don’t really want to do the ground. I don’t want to do sales demos. I don’t want to focus on one product and push that boulder up the hill. I don’t want to try to run ads. That doesn’t sound interesting. The way my mind works is I really want to build a media company. Well, I just start a YouTube channel and be on Twitter and tweet about things and have that build my business. I don’t want to hire people. I don’t want to have to fire people. I don’t want to make the hard decision of having to focus on one thing. I don’t want to do b2b. That sounds boring. I want to build a two-sided marketplace. I’m not saying that’s not hard, that’s actually doing it on hard mode, but you get the idea. I get emails to this podcast about I have a good day job and I’m making good money, but I really want to be an entrepreneur, but I just have a tough time getting motivated. And I think to myself, then you don’t really want to be an entrepreneur and that’s okay. That’s okay. Just know that if you’re going to do this, you have to do hard things. I was in conversation with someone who had sold their company for nine figures, so that’s hundreds of millions of dollars. And one of the things that he does is talk to other founders who have exited for never have to Work again, money. I call it sunset Money. You can ride off into the sunset. Some people call it FU money, and that’s fine too. It’s all the same. And he said one of the big things he encounters, and this is similar when I have these conversations with folks, one of the hard things is if you sell your company for whatever that number is for you, maybe it’s 5 million for you, maybe it’s 10 million, maybe it’s 50 million. You sell your company, you’ve been grinding, you’ve been creating, you’ve been building, and you have all this money in the bank, and it’s really hard to figure out what to do next. That’s meaningful, but not so hard that you’ll just give up because when you have that much money in the bank, why do hard things? What’s the motivation anymore? So many of us had the motivation to build these companies of I want to build interesting things. I want freedom. I want to be in charge of my own time, and basically that means I have to get rich in order to do it. But that becomes a motivation for a lot of people. It’s not to get rich. It’s the freedom, right? It’s the ability to build and work on and do whatever you want for the rest of your life, and that is an amazing place to be in. Now the challenge is your motivation to stick through the hard times and to do really hard things like the mile warmup, the mile cool down, and the really hard workout in between or to grind for months and months on SEO or ads or focusing on a product, trying to find product-market fit, and staying up at night thinking, am I ever going to find product-market fit, dealing with an employee who doesn’t work out and you have to fire and rehire. There’s all these things that are difficult, that are challenging and finding that motivation, whether you have enough money to make to never work again, or whether you don’t and you just want to be an entrepreneur, but you don’t feel that drive enough to push you to want to do really hard things. It’s a challenge. And so I tell this story about Brian running two miles to a convenience store to grab chocolate chip ice cream. He did return with chocolate chip, by the way, and there were a couple people that wasn’t just Brian who wanted it. There were some parents or something that wanted chocolate chip, and when he went, he walked out in the lobby and they didn’t have it. He just took off. He didn’t even go back and ask him. He just left and ran a four mile round trip to get chocolate chip ice cream for these other people. So I hope that anecdote has you thinking about the hard things that perhaps should be normalized in your day today. My second topic for today is a fun fact. I heard the other day, and then I confirmed it with not only chat GPT, but with Google as well. And it’s about how a pack or a herd, technically speaking of bisons, if they see a blizzard coming or a storm, they will walk into the storm because they know that whatever direction the storm is headed, it will go by faster if they are moving into that storm. And think about that, there’s some type of really deep adaptation that has gone on there because I think for most of us, we don’t want to walk into the storm and most animals will run away from a storm or from danger or from something that is perceived as uncomfortable, but the bison knows that if they take this big challenge head on, it will be over faster. Hopefully. The parallel to running a startup is really obvious. What are the storms? What are the blizzards that are coming at you? The lack of product-market fit, the lack of growth, impending competitors that are going to eat your lunch. Ai, a rapidly changing landscape. Folks who can spin up a similar app to you in a week now because of copilot or cursor AI or all these coding tools, people building stuff with no code that is purpose built and perhaps solves a need better than your custom app that you spent years building can. So what do bison know that we don’t? Well, they know that if you ignore a threat or if you walk sideways or away from it, you’re just going to experience it longer. It doesn’t actually fix anything. And you as the startup founder or an aspiring startup founder, I think would be well-served to figure out what are the big things that make you uncomfortable, the things that stress you out, the things that keep you up at night. And instead of trying to ignore them, trying to run away from them, trying to hide from them, think about how can I attack this head on? Whether this is someone working for you who just isn’t quite working out and you let it go way too long. That’s a very common thing. The startup founders do. All of us do it at one point or another in our careers and all of us come to regret that decision of ignoring it is not a threat in this case, but I mean it’s a threat to our growth. It’s a threat to our business. It is just a hard thing that’s easy to ignore. Another hard thing is lack of growth, and your R is not going up into the right. Do you make excuses? Do you blame the internet? Do you say, oh, startup advice doesn’t work anymore? Well, in 2024, it doesn’t work the way it used. You used to just be able to do SEO content and AdWords and everything would just work out, and it was so easy, which in fact it wasn’t. But you convince yourself of this because you’re not having success, or is it hard and you need to figure out which direction to head and you need to persevere long enough and normalize doing hard things. Ooh, see the way I integrated those two but normalize running the four mile round trip to get the chocolate chip ice cream in order to face these things that are difficult. If you’re always running away or ignoring or making excuses or acting like these hard things don’t exist, you’re not going to find success. I can’t think. Now, maybe there’s an exception, but I can’t think of a single entrepreneur that I have worked with, advised, been around, invested in, and I’m invested now in, I think it’s 212 B2B, SaaS companies can’t think of a single one that has achieved success. And we can just say, what is that? I dunno. Seven figure and up a R seven figure eight, figure a RR. Can’t think of one that ignored these hard things that didn’t accept their current reality, even if that reality was not what they wanted to hear and didn’t make a game plan a, plan a, plan B, a plan C of how to deal with and address it. I’ve known founders, multiple founders that have received cease and desist letters. I know multiple that have been sued. I know many that have been threatened to be sued. I know several that have been hacked where their app has been hacked. There has been ransom situations where I’m going to release this on the dark web if you don’t pay us X amount of Bitcoin. I’ve seen embezzlement, I’ve seen employees rogue. The list goes on and on, and whether it’s any of those or whether it’s something as simple as, oh, hey, we’re not growing, and that’s the storm, that’s the coming storm is that if we don’t grow for too much longer, we’re done. We either have to lay everybody off or the app itself. We just need to shut down the company. That has to be the hard reality that you face on a day-to-day basis. And I am not trying to paint entrepreneurship as this terrible hard thing. You have to work 60 hour weeks all the time and be stressed. That’s not how it should be either. If it’s that hard, either you’re trying to build a billion dollar company or maybe your approach isn’t quite right, or frankly, maybe you’re running into some bad luck, but it doesn’t have to be hard all the time. I just want to level set for you listening that there will be ups and downs and when the ups are here, celebrate them. And when the downs are here and the difficult times are present for you, realize that that is part of this game. That is part of being an entrepreneur and learning and being willing to face those hard things head on is something that I wished I had learned sooner, and if only I had learned this tidy fact about bisons walking into storms years ago, perhaps I would’ve been better equipped. And that’s what I hope to convey to you here today. So I hope you continue your entrepreneurial journey a little better equipped to do so. My last topic for today is about first making it work, then making it right, then making it fast. And this is a quote or a paraphrase from the Comic Lab podcast that I have quoted in or paraphrased several times in the past. You can go check it out if you’re interested. But the co-hosts I find are very practical and pragmatic and the number of parallels between being an independent comic artist, which is essentially being an entrepreneur and making money from your art. Now it is B2C, so it doesn’t necessarily fit in the focus of this podcast, but a lot of what they talk about I find has parallels in the startup space and specifically in the bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS space. So one of the hosts, Brad had this quote. He said, first, make it work, then make it right and then make it fast. And the context he was using was about art, was about drawing or writing frankly, anything that you would do to produce a comic strip or a comic book or a web comic and about how when you’re just starting out, just learning to draw or learning to write and be funny is hard. And so it might take you, it probably will take you years just to make it work, but you’re going to be really slow at it and it’s not going to be that good. So then the next step is you’re not that good at it, but make it good. That’s the making it right step. So I think it’s like make it work, then make it good and then make it fast. But he says make it right. And I can say that, look, it’s his phrase. He can name it whatever he wants. So first step is to make it work, then you make it right and then over repetition, you make it fast basically. And I actually like thoughts or frameworks or statements like this that make me think, oh yeah, that’s totally obvious, but I didn’t say it. I haven’t heard it phrased this way this succinctly before, but I think the parallels run deep. I think this podcast, if you go back and listen, the first 20 or 30 episodes, maybe 40 or 50, we’re just trying to make it work. And we did shipped every week. There were a couple months where we shipped every other week, but you get the idea over the 14 year lifespan of this podcast and the 742 episodes, the first 20 to 40 were making it work the next, I don’t know how many were making it right? And then eventually we got to the point and later me on my own got to the point where I can record these really fast. That took repetition. That didn’t happen in the first a hundred episodes. The fast part was probably in the second hundred or maybe the third a hundred, frankly, these solo episodes. I didn’t start doing these until several hundred in, and those were excruciating and painful at first, and then through repetition, I made them write and made them fast. Same thing. If you’re writing and giving conference talks, your first one’s not going to be that good. You got to make it right. And then over time you get better. To the point where I’ve given talks that I have literally built the slides four days in advance and run through the talk once, and then I get up on stage. And that’s just pure repetition because the first talk I gave, I was working on weeks and weeks in advance, and I was practicing over and over because I didn’t know how to do it well, and I didn’t know how to do it fast. It’s the same thing with sales demos. First time you do it, it’s not going to be very good. You’re going to be super nervous and you’re going to potentially over prepare, spend a lot of time on it, and then over time, over repetition, you make it so it’s good. The making it fast maybe doesn’t apply here, but I do think maybe making the deck for your sales demo applies, right? That you would get better a second time building a deck for it. Marketing approaches similar. First you just kind of stumble through and you don’t know what’s going to work, and eventually you make something work just enough that it keeps you alive for another month and then you start getting better at thinking strategically and about thinking like a marketer. And then eventually you get to the point where you can spin up new marketing approaches. I’ll say quickly, right? That’s the fast part. Now the analogy doesn’t necessarily hold up. It’s not a piece of art. And so thinking that you can spin up five or six marketing approaches just because you’re good at it isn’t reality in most situations. Most companies don’t have that many, but you get the idea. You do get better at moving fast and doing a lot of things. A r and I talk about the most successful founders across the tiny C portfolio of 192 companies are those founders that do a lot of things relatively quickly. They put a lot of things into the world, and they’re right enough of the time. And Ruben, the founder of Sewell, mentioned to me that he liked that analogy, but he felt like I was leaving something out. When I say that the founders who do a lot of things and are right enough of the time, and I think enough is 50, 60, 70%, it’s somewhere in there and there’s asymmetric upside when they are right? But Ruben was saying, yeah, but even those founders, one of ’em for sure, even those founders that do it, they’re not necessarily right immediately out of the gate when they try a new thing. Usually it’s off a bit. And every approach needs to be honed unless you get really lucky, you launch a new sales effort, a new marketing effort, a new landing page, a new feature, a new product. You hire someone new, there’s a certain level of refinement, maybe some experimentation, but of putting something into the wild and realizing, oh, that’s not quite right, and I need to tweak it according to my founder gut and according to the taste that I have in my mind of what a landing page should look like or what a feature launch should be or how a marketing approach should be executed, I’m going to take the signals that I’m getting back and there’s a feedback loop and I’m going to iterate, I’m going to tweak. And then eventually, you’re right enough of the time. So don’t think that right out of the gate, founders who are doing exceptionally well are just right all the time, but you do build your founder gut. I use this phrase all the time, and the editor for the SaaS Playbook was like, that’s not a real thing, and it has to be founder’s Gut, right? It’s a possessive that the founder possesses this gut instinct. And I was like, I guess, but almost it’s like capital F, capital G, it’s like founder gut. It’s a thing that I name of over time, you can develop this. Some people probably have it from the start. I think like Jason Cohen Heat and Shaw probably Dharmesh. There’s some people that I know David cancel that at least as I saw them going on their journey, they just seemed from the start to kind of know what they were doing and to generally work on the right things with asymmetric upside ship, a lot of things really smart people. I was not that I was stumbling around blindly for years and years in my twenties and early thirties, not really knowing what I should be working on. And my founder gut was not great. And the way that I developed it was through people giving me advice. People that were ahead of me, watching people who have really strong founder guts and seeing how they made decisions. It’s just a refinement and a learning and an iteration of myself, a constant search for self-improvement. And part of that I’ve talked about on the show in the past, which is knowing yourself not having blind spots. We all have weaknesses, but a blind spot is a weakness that we’re not aware of. And so even taking the personality tests, the Enneagram and the StrengthsFinder and the Kolby A and there’s a few others, do those unlock everything and all the magic to make you a high performer? No, but they give you one more data point, and if you can read through the descriptions and say, oh, yeah, the strength side of this certain attribute is that I really focus on things and I really focus and get it done. And the shadow side of that is I focus too long and I spend years working on stuff that isn’t working. And knowing that about yourself goes a long way towards helping you improve as a founder and improving your founder gut. Now back to first making it work, then making it right, and they’re making it fast. I do see people try to skip this and they see much like in the stair step method, I often say, Hey, if you see folks that are playing in the major leagues and you haven’t played T-ball yet, you don’t want to go try to play in the major leagues right away. You want to play T-ball and then little league and then junior high ball and high school ball, college ball, minor leagues, major leagues, right? There’s a bunch of steps along the way, and I see folks, I guess it’s on Twitter, I hear ’em on podcasts, whatever, who see an entrepreneur that is 5, 10, 15 years ahead of them or someone who has assets that they do not such as, well, you have half a million Twitter followers and I have 500, but I’m going to try the same approach because that surely that will work. It’s like trying to jump to the end without putting in all the time to first make it work, then make it right, and then make it fast. I mean, what’s interesting about this phrase is just how much it does align with the stair-step method. It hadn’t occurred to me until right now as I’m saying this, it’s crawl, walk, run. Don’t try to run from the start. Don’t try to play major league baseball from the start. Don’t try to quit your day job and have a burn down of all your money. I had six months to launch a standalone SaaS and get traction. I’ve never done this before. It’s like, well, hold on. How about you make it work by just launching anything? And whether that’s a plugin in an app marketplace or an ecosystem, whether it’s an ebook or a course or whatever, just build enough of an audience or learn to market well enough or build enough of a network that you just get something out there and then get better at it, right? That’s the make it right. And look, that might take a few years. This is why I say think in years, not months. As an entrepreneur, as a bootstrap founder, especially think in years, not months, don’t be in such a hurry to get to the end result because then you’re trying to jump to the make it fast. And that’s where this ridiculous idea that I should spray and pray one thing every week. I’m going to launch 50 apps this year and just see what sticks. I’m going to see what’s going to make it work that’s wanting to get to make it fast and take a shortcut to get there and not do the learning and not put in the hard work and not face the hardest things that are the blizzard that is marching toward you. And I think people that are trying to skip the line and get there are doing themselves a disservice and are much less likely to be able to repeat it again in the future, are much more likely to need to rely on luck and are much less likely to succeed in the longterm and to be able to do it again, even if they do. Now, am I saying you have to grind it out and put in years. It’s like you got to go through high school and then you got to go through university, and then you got to go through, get your master’s and then your PhD, and then you got to work 10 years before you have seniority. So that’s just what we all did. And so you got to put in 20 years. No, that’s not what I’m saying. Obviously the beauty of entrepreneurship and what we’re all doing is you don’t have to take the same path that anyone else did. But I do see early stage folks making the mistake of thinking that they can just jump to the make it fast. They can just jump to that end. But if you can’t make it work and make it right, it doesn’t matter if it’s fast because you’re shipping something crappy, and whether that thing that’s crappy is a product or ebook or whatever it is, if it doesn’t work and it’s not right, what’s the point of trying to make it fast? I gave a talk after I sold Drip, and it was called 11 Years to Overnight Success, and it measured the time from launching my first little micro product wound up doing a thousand, 2000, 3000 a month until Sunset Money, right until selling Drip and never having to work again. And the title was Tongue in Cheek, obviously 11 years to Overnight success because people think this stuff happens overnight and almost without exception, or maybe without exception, it doesn’t, doesn’t happen overnight, crawl, walk, run. You stair step your way up, you first make it work, then you make it right, and then you make it fast. Thanks so much for joining me this week and every week on the show. If you keep listening, I’ll keep recording.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I sit down with Wes Bush. He’s one of the key proponents of the product led growth movement as the author of two books on the subject, product led growth, how to build a product that sells itself and the Product Led playbook, how to unlock Self-serve revenue, and dominate your market with a tiny team. I wanted to have Wes on the show today because I think there are a lot of misconceptions and a lot of myths around what product-led growth actually is, and I wanted to talk with Wes, obviously one of the foremost experts on this topic, to really try to peel away myth from fact and really get to the heart of product-led growth, why you might want to consider it and when it’s a good idea when it’s not. Before we dive into our conversation, MicroConf Mastermind matching happens three times a year and it’s happening right now, applications close on December 4th, so just a week or two after this episode goes live. Masterminds have been critical to my development and frankly, my longevity as an entrepreneur, and I’ve been a proponent of them for probably 12 or 13 years. You can go to startups For, the Rest Of Us dot com and search for startup mastermind and find the first time that I ever mentioned it on the show. And it’s a long time ago because I became a believer in meeting with like-minded founders over time, a small group of founders who really followed my journey, almost like honorary co-founders. So if you’ve been feeling alone or isolated or lost or you’re just not sure what to do next and you need some accountability and someone else to be in the trenches alongside you, head to microcomp.com/masterminds. You pay a one-time fee, and we will match you up with other like-minded founders. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Wes West Bush. Thanks so much for joining me on the show. Thanks  Wes Bush:For having me. I’m excited to be  Rob Walling:Here. I’m excited to talk about product led growth with you for a long time. Listeners of the show, they know I have a love hate relationship with the term product-led growth because I like shorthand terms, even product-market fit, I feel the same way. It’s like, oh, if I say that, and we kind of both know what that means, it can be thousands of words encapsulating that. The problem is when I say product-market fit, if there’s 10 of us in a room, there’s 10 different definitions of it. And I feel like product-led growth is a bit like that and sometimes misused, especially by developers who just want their product to sell itself. Do you find that in your role as, I mean you’re an ambassador, you’ve written three books on product-led growth. Do you find that as well?  Wes Bush:Oh, totally. And one of the most viral tweets that I got, a ton of retweets and stuff, I was like, product growth, this is just an effing free trial. It was like, oh, okay. There’s a lot of people that  Rob Walling:Think that.  Wes Bush:So it was interesting.  Rob Walling:So I want to start by letting people know, you’ve written three books on product-led growth, so you certainly, of all the guests I’ve had on this podcast, probably the person who knows the most about it and who has thought the most about it. You have the product-led playbook, you have product-led growth, that title and product led onboarding  Wes Bush:Ley. John did write that one. I just wrote the first chapter, but  Rob Walling:Oh, okay. Well, thanks for the clarification. Yeah, no worries. I’d love to start by let’s do the best job we can at really defining what product led growth is. So I’ll kick it to you, you say what you think it is, and then I’m going to say like, well, is this product leg growth? Just so we can kind of tease it apart because I have my own internal definition of what is, I’m not even sure it’s right. So talk us through PLG.  Wes Bush:Yeah, and I think where a lot of people get confused is thinking of one dimension of like, oh yeah, that’s product like growth, whereas it’s a multi-dimensional thing that impacts your entire business. So here’s a fun way of thinking about it, is product-led growth is when you use your product to acquire new customers, engage them, meaning getting them to value and also monetizing. And you could also take that to expanding customers as well, but it’s where you’re using your product throughout your entire go-to market motion. It’s not just the free trial for people to sign up for free, but it helps them get the value. It also upgrades them and you can use it for expansion as well. And so at the surface, that’s what it is in its simplest way, and you’re talking about different examples of it, what it looks like. I’ll use some non-software as a service examples like Cologne, perfume, I think those are great examples of PLG and the real world where it’s like, Hey, I can try it before I buy it. And that’s really, I think a core tenant of it. It’s got to have that experience where, okay, I tried it for free, I like  Rob Walling:It. Oh, I like that example of cologne. I’d never thought of it. To me, when I hear PLG, I’m just like SaaS, SaaS and software,  Wes Bush:Right? Yeah,  Rob Walling:Self-serve freemium. These things all come to mind, but that’s kind of cool to hear an example of a real world product. So now I want to ask you some questions and say, is this product led growth or is it not? So my last SaaS startup was called Drip. It’s still functioning here in town downtown Minneapolis, and we had a self-serve trial credit card upfront, and for now, we had no free plan. Later we did. So we’re going to get a lot of examples out of this, but no free plan. Put a credit card upfront. You get a trial for whatever it was, 14, 21 days inside the app, there was a bunch of onboarding stuff, there were videos and kind of like, Hey, do this next, and you got emails to come and engage and do this next. And then if you got fully set up, then you got to choose if you canceled your trial or if your credit card got charged at the end basically. I always thought of that as just, to me, I just say, well, that’s self-serve SaaS that it existed since Basecamp is self-serve SaaS, and I had hit tail in 20 10, 20 11, that was self-serve SaaS, and it all followed that model. But would you include that under the umbrella of PLG?  Wes Bush:Well, here’s a qualifying question. First, we’re users that were signing up able to get to value for free. They could, in drips case, send a lot of emails and really feel like, okay, I got the value from the product, could do something interesting in the product that I couldn’t do before.  Rob Walling:And that was included in the trial itself. It truly was a free trial. And yes, they could do everything in terms of uploading subscribers, sending emails, getting the value that the product offered.  Wes Bush:So that would be an example where it’s like, yes, I would consider that product led. Now I’m going to try and confuse everybody here for a second and give an example of a company that does have a free trial but is not product led because it’s not always the same case. So this company is called ZoomInfo. A lot of people know about them. You can sign up for the free trial and it’s actually more of a request, a free trial. And then you get to the, okay, you fill out your info and it’s like book a call. You got to go through this whole experience and everything from the second you fill out that form is like convert, let’s convert them and let’s get them on the phone and convert them. So there was no value exchange, there was no kind of try before I buy experience. So you can actually have a free experience, free trial, but if every bone in that company is soon as you sign up is like convert them, convert them, convert them, no, that’s still just using a different mousetrap At the end of the day, what the biggest changes between what I would classify as more of a sales led company versus a product led one really comes down to, if you think of oversimplify, a go-to market motion, there’s really three things that go on in any business. There’s acquisition, there’s monetization, you got to make customers, and then there’s the overall engagement delivering on the value. Now a traditional sales like company, it’s like you acquire them, then it kicks off the monetization side of things. Then it’s about engagement, delivering on the value. The big change in product-led growth and product-led companies is just that middle piece. It switches. So it goes from acquisition to engagements. You deliver value before you purchase, and then it’s monetization. And so whenever you’re thinking, is this a sales led or a product led company, just refer back to that because that is probably the easiest way to kind of see, oh, okay, is that truly your product led company or not?  Rob Walling:So it’s engage, monetize or swapped is what you’re saying?  Wes Bush:Exactly.  Rob Walling:That’s interesting. Okay, let me ask you this, then there’s a company called Spark Toro. Have you heard of it? Rand Fishkins company?  Wes Bush:Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Rob Walling:And I’m an investor there, friends with Rand, they have a try it free button on their website. When you click it, you do self sign up for an account, your username and password, or I think you can authentic through Google. And then what you do is you get a, it’s a really limited free plan. In essence, you get five searches a month, so very limited and I believe you only get the top three or four results or five results when there might be hundreds. And if you’re a paying customer, you can get all the data. And for folks who don’t know about Spark Toro, the H one is how do you get better ROI from content, SEO, social PR and performance marketing smart to is basically an audience research tool for marketers. So with that stage set of how I just described kind of this free, it’s even a stretch to say it’s a free mean plan, it is quite limited, but what is that? Is that product-led growth? Definitely not. They’re not doing sales. So does that by default mean their product led growth?  Wes Bush:Yeah, in theory, that’s the free motion they have that. I think that’s definitely in the right direction. The only thing where I would be like, okay, is that the right thing they’re giving away free is could someone sign up for that and feel like they genuinely got some insight that was really meaningful to them? Now, if they can check the box on that, it’s like, Hey, that’s a great free motion. And yeah, I would still classify that as product led, you’re giving away free, but what separates a great free model from one that’s just mediocre and not many people convert at the end of the day is it all comes down to what is the outcome of that free product? Does it have one very similar products that we’re working with? One of our clients, it’s for trade opportunities if for export import businesses, let’s say are trying to find the best baati rice exporter, and it’s like it shows the database, you know what? They only need to find one. They need to find one deal that’s really incredible. And what we decided to give away for free is like, hey, finding that person finding that is free now if you want to contact them, then you got to upgrade at that specific stage. Now it doesn’t seem like it’s a lot, but it’s enough. It’s enough for them to fill, they walk away from that experience saying, Hey, if I need to find another export import business, I know exactly where I got to go. And same thing with Spark Tora. It’s like as long as they find out of those top four or three options, something’s meaningful, then it’s enough. But that’s the tricky part too, because if you search and you waste those five searches on something, you don’t find anything useful, then people are like, this product sucks.  Rob Walling:And I kind of asked a question without asking a question with my last prompt, which is sales led is what maybe the Jason Lemkin playbook, I think of it where it’s just a lot of outbound and it’s just this, you build up this big sales force, the boiler room as they say, and you obviously have inbound, you try to do inbound, and anybody who comes inbound, it’s like do a demo, put ’em through the sales funnel versus product led. What you’re saying is, well, that’s more of the product provides the value. I feel like that’s a false dichotomy. I feel like there’s more nuance to this whole story than that. And in fact, coming back to Drip, we did both of those things. Now we did outbound, it was not a huge motion, but we had a ton of inbound. I’m a better marketer than a salesperson, let’s put it that way. So we had a ton of inbound just from all the stuff we were doing. And what we noticed was on the lower end, if someone’s going to pay us $50 a month or a hundred dollars a month, those our cheapest plans had to be product led. We weren’t going to do a demo, just the A CV. The LTV was not there for it. But we’d see someone come through and it’d be like, oh, this is someone, it’s a website that that if I said the name of you would know. And it’s like, well, I’m sure they have a million subscribers and they’re probably going to pay us $3,000 a month. So then we would reach out to them and we’re like, we need to get on the phone with you. We know that we can help close the deal. So I call that a dual funnel now where there’s lower end and the higher end and you handle ’em differently. So I guess were we sales led? Were we product led, or would you just say, well, you’re both,  Wes Bush:Yeah, that’s both hybrid and that’s great motion to have if you can do that. If you’re only product let’s say is like $10 per month, something like, it’s like, okay, it probably doesn’t make sense even if that company did sign up because there’s not that expansion opportunity where you can make it work. But no, I love those motions and I think that’s using the best of both worlds where it’s saying, Hey, if you’re a small company here, self-serve, do that. And if you’re a bigger company, hey, there’s a different approach. And we could actually maybe even position that instead of just like, Hey, you want to hop on a call with me? It’s like, Hey, I know you have a big list. How can we create email marketing strategy together that is going to be so much better than what you’re currently doing? And they’re like, man, this drip company’s really looking out for me outside of just looking for another place to send emails. They’re a value added partner here, absolutely like 3000 per month. That seems like a no brainer deal. To get this advice to  Rob Walling:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results and longtime listener, Chaz Yu hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his higher quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used Lemon io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. So let’s talk a little bit about product-led growth. And I think a lot of people think freemium, you have to have freemium and you’re basically like, no, a free trial, as long as you get value out of the product and that’s engaging in monetizing, that is a qualifier. You can still be included in the PLG Hall of Fame if we’re a paid or a free trial that makes, oh no, it’s the monetization has to be after. So it can’t be a paid trial,  Wes Bush:It  Rob Walling:Has to be  Wes Bush:Free. So the free model you choose actually doesn’t matter. So if you look at billion dollar plus product companies, you’ll find every company with whether it’s a free trial, a Freeman model usage-based trial, they’re all out there. What does matter though is deciding what is the main outcome of your free model. So what could you actually do when you sign up for that free product? And is it actually something that feels like it’s tangible value for that user? A lot of times I’ll send it for a free trial as an example, and you click around and you do a couple things. You’re like, Whoopi, I can’t do anything I couldn’t do before. There is no transformation. And the best product companies, they all have somewhat of a transformation where it’s like, Hey, before chat GBT and after chat GBT, it’s like it is pretty clear there was a difference there in productivity and all those other things. So you got to have that. You got to allow your product to shine in that free experience. And so I could go on a whole big tangent, Rob, go through how do you actually decide what’s to giveaway for free? But I just wanted to point that out that the model doesn’t matter as much as people think it is, it’s what that outcome is. And deciding what that is is really the tricky part.  Rob Walling:It’s interesting because with Bootstrappers, which the majority of this audience is folks who are bootstrapping are mostly bootstrapping, frankly. I mean there’s 20 or 30% who want to raise funding or have raised some type of funding, but it is just the non venture track. SaaS founders is kind of the listeners of this audience. We’ve just always done product led. That’s just what we did from the start. Because I wasn’t good at sales demos, I wasn’t going to do a bunch of outbound, my SaaS 2009, 2010, 11, it was marketing. And since I was charging early SaaS companies, I had with 10, 20, 40 a month, so really low end and then 50, a hundred, 200 with Drip. I couldn’t afford to do anything but build onboarding into the app because I had to operate at a scale that it just required that and I wasn’t going to be able to manually onboard. So I acquired through SEO content, a bunch of other demand gen, and then I engaged in the product because I was a developer. And that’s the only way to automate it to the point where I could have 500 or a thousand customers in order to get to tens of thousands of dollars a month in MRR and then of course monetization. It was always just a free trial to monetize. So it really sounds like the default for most bootstrappers is probably going to be product led. Is that accurate?  Wes Bush:So I think the mindset of them wanting to go this direction is, but then there’s very few folks where that is like, Hey, this is what I want to do, and I’m actually seeing really good success with it because I think folks like yourself where you have just naturally done it is actually really rare. There’s like for every one of you, there’s probably 10 others that are like, yeah, I want that too. Yet when I try and do the product led thing, I suck at it or it just doesn’t work out the way I thought it was. The free to paid conversion rates really bad and because users can’t get the value, they just don’t upgrade. So there’s a host of other reasons why it usually doesn’t work. But yeah, I’d say generally speaking, they do want that specific direction because they see that is the most efficient way to scale this business without adding people and more cost to the equation.  Rob Walling:And I think one of the annoying things for me with PLG is that people have misused it, and I see makers and developers being like, it means I don’t have to market because the product just sells itself. And it’s like, that’s not my, I don’t think any product really sells itself. I mean, again, it sounds like I’ve been running all my SaaS was PLG, and yet it never sold itself. I marketed the shit out of that stuff. I drove a lot of traffic, I did a lot of split testing, a lot of conversion optimization. I optimized the hell out of the funnels, the onboard, all of that was a massive thing before growth hacking was a thing. I was doing all of it. It was like, well, I know I want these numbers to go up. I know I want trial to pay to go up. How do I do that? Well, I got to get more people onboarded. How do I do that? Well, I need more people to install the JavaScript snippet on my thing, so how do I do that? And I, it was just a very logical flow. But do you feel, is it just me or do you feel like some devs, maybe especially builder types, maybe misuse the term?  Wes Bush:Oh yeah. And I think the biggest reeducation a lot of times do it product-led is just the fact that it’s like, Hey, you still have to market this. You still have to sell it and have really good understanding of what that looks like. There is very few companies I’ve interviewed hundreds of product-led founders where I’m like one out of maybe 300 has a situation where their product does market itself really, really well. But that is because they were super intentional about how that product was going to interact with other people. Mixmax is perfect example. When I was interviewing the CO Olaf, he was like, you know what? We have a $0 cost per acquisition cost. I was like, this is pretty fantastic. But it’s like you send an email powered by mix. I was like, oh, you got this beautiful growth lever, external virality. How many companies have that? Most companies just have internal virality where it’s like, Hey, you share this with your other employees and other users. That’s not going to get you that crazy marketing growth and a user signups that you want. But every once in a while you do find a company where it’s like, that really worked for them and you just hope that that might be your company.  Rob Walling:But as you’re saying, it’s one out of hundreds. Slack was used often as an early example, PLG. Would you say they’re similar because it did feel like there’s a viral loop in Slack that kind of became associated with product-led growth means that you infiltrate an org and then they invite a bunch of people and there’s virality and it doesn’t sound like that’s what we’re talking about. It sounds like they had that extra bonus of being one out of a few hundred where it could kind of market itself.  Wes Bush:Yeah. Well, slack had really fantastic internal virality. You just think of the natural side of like, okay, Rob’s not on this installation. Let’s add Rob. And it’s like, sure, he is on our team, so why not? And it just naturally gravitates towards that. But since it was such a good product and did it so much better than email in a lot of ways, then it just naturally grew out from that, from word of mouth. But they did invest. If you still look at their p and l, majority of their expenses are still going towards marketing and sales, which is fascinating to see that. And maybe that shouldn’t be the case right now since their acquisition and now their product has just kind of stayed stagnant. But it’s worth considering, yes, invest in marketing and sales. It does not mean being a product of business. You don’t have to do that.  Rob Walling:I think the probably the biggest point I want to drive home today for people listening is I think there’s a lot of perhaps misunderstanding or miscommunication around it. So then it begs the question, what are the big benefits of product led growth as opposed to sales led? The big benefits that you see,  Wes Bush:It really just comes down to do you want to have a leveraged business where it’s the asset you’re building is the product As you scale up, you get more and more efficient, you get more profits, can afford to have a higher revenue per employee, all that fun stuff. Or do you want the people to be the machine in the business? And so many folks, it’s like, actually, I want more leverage in the business. And so that’s the biggest thing. It just comes down to leverage at the end of the day.  Rob Walling:And you mentioned to me offline before we started that you actually have something you’d like to give to the listeners. What do you have?  Wes Bush:Yeah, so I just wrote the product-led playbook, which at the very beginning of this book, I’m like, Hey, you know what? This is not the book for you. If you don’t know if product-led growth is right for you. That’s the first one I wrote. Product-led growth. This one is literally just here’s how you actually do it. It goes through nine core pieces that you got to implement inside your business, like onboarding pricing. It just gives you the exact frameworks for how to do it and the templates. So it’s all free for you product led gift.com, and you can just get that for free. And that’s the entire book we held. Nothing back there.  Rob Walling:Awesome. Well thanks for that. I hope folks check it out. So I have one or two questions for you before we wrap up. And I think I want to frame, because I’m looking at an outline of the book, I have a table of contest and stuff in chapter six, how to decide what to give away for free versus what to monetize. It’s such a good conversation. And frankly, this is a common one I have with my investments. I’m invested in 200 and I think it’s 212 SaaS companies through TinySeed and then individually. And so I see the gamut, freemium or not of free trial, of not of sales led, product led, like the whole deal. And frequently I’m pulled into conversations. A lot of it’s pricing strategy and then it’s currently what we have, what should we, and I’m always like, I have my own kind of mental pattern matching framework, but I’ve never written it. I don’t even know if I could put it into words. So I’m curious. I know you can’t read the whole chapter six, but what’s the base framework there?  Wes Bush:Yeah, I think this would be more fun too, if you tell me about a company that really well that they were struggling with this, and we can workshop and as people listen, this will be like five minutes and we could go through that framework.  Rob Walling:Cool. So is this a free trial or is it freemium in this example?  Wes Bush:No, it could be anything. You pick the company, I’ll use the framework and then people will kind of learn through that.  Rob Walling:Alright, so let’s talk about frequent podcast guest, Derek Rimer. He runs a company called Savvy Cal. They are a competitor to Calendly and they have a free trial or it’s a 30 day money back guarantee. Let’s pretend they had a 30 day free trial because they’re PLG, but they do have a money back guarantee. So that’s in essence what they’re trying to do. They do not have a freemium, a free forever  Wes Bush:Plan. So thanks for that. I got their website pulled up and now who is their ideal user? The person they feel like, Hey, we got to just target this person. They’re the best people.  Rob Walling:So they actually have a couple, my understanding, or there were early adopters that were listeners to this podcast, that type bootstrappers and founders of Bootstrap companies. I think they made a shift as the audience grew or as their customer base grew and they started getting calendar power users, which I think are a lot more salespeople.  Wes Bush:So first off, this is why it’s so hard, and this is for everybody listening. If you don’t know without a hundred percent confidence who your ideal user is, and I’m on the website too, it’s not just you, Rob, it’s not clear who is this for? I don’t know. Because in the world of calendar booking systems, it’s commoditized right now. There’s tidy Cal if I want to pay 49 bucks once. Sure. And there’s a ton of different options out there and book like a boss, they have a very specific persona on service professionals and stuff. So that would be the first kind of task I’d be like, okay, get really clear. Let’s go with a sales person though, because that’s more fun. And so let’s say it’s salespeople now, what is ultimate success for that sales person? We got to get super clear on that. What would you say that looks like, even if we’re just making it up on the spot a bit  Rob Walling:Ultimate success, that it’s a complete super seamless booking experience for their prospects.  Wes Bush:And now if we think about this space, unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard of Calendly. So what is the unique sauce that they might bring to the table that’s like, Hey, this is unique, differentiated for people that are sales reps that are trying to just book easier?  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s not on the website now, but the early positioning of avial was most booking links. There’s a power differential and it can be offensive to send your booking link because it’s like, oh, now you put a bunch of work on my shoulder,  Wes Bush:Right?  Rob Walling:Yep. Oh really? Now I got to click around, blah, blah, blah. And that was Avi Cal’s early positioning was, so I’m going to go with that. But the differentiated between them and Calendly is the booking experience itself is very much does everything you can do with amazing UX to remove that feeling.  Wes Bush:Okay, so let’s say for the salesperson, we have, I’m pulling up a stat out of thin air here, but it’s 30% more meetings booked with your ideal prospects just because the experience is better and everything else. So that’s success. We’re trying to gear people towards that. Now, if we think about making this a game, this is where we get to the model part. Let’s divide this up into three levels. There’s your beginner level, which is, think about it as the newbie. They sign up, they’re like, oh yeah, let’s go through this, see what it’s all about. Then there’s your intermediate level. This is your first paid pro plan, and there’s the events level, which is your most expensive stuff. So for that initial beginner one, what might that beginner outcome be? Is it enough for it to just be, Hey, book one meeting with the prospect? Is it five meetings, 10 meetings? What do you think that might be for them?  Rob Walling:Probably one. I think it’s just that initial meeting.  Wes Bush:So it could literally just be one meeting. Now if they do a test or something like that, that might be a bit tricky where it’s like, okay, they did the test meeting on their own.  Rob Walling:Oh, I see. Oh, I was thinking one meeting with each prospect. You’re just saying, yeah, the absolute value. At what point would they, huh, that’s interesting. Let’s say they booked five meetings, five prospects book meetings or five book meetings. Overall, you can do that with any, there’s no differentiation. You can do that with any calendar software. So it would almost to me be like, the moment that someone complimented me and said, holy, that was a really great booking. That would be the moment where I’d be like, oh, someone noticed that it was different. I dunno if that can be a qualifying event or not. But  Wes Bush:Yeah, and this is the tricky part, right? Because it’s the special secret sauce. Whatever makes your product shine needs to come out in that free version. And if it’s just meat game one meeting booked, so what? It doesn’t pass the hurdle. And so this is one of the challenges when you’re thinking about what to give away for free if you’re in a very saturated space with a lot of competitors that already have really good free motions, and so you have to be creative. What is that new experience? And so would, like you said, it has to go back to did they, maybe it’s a customer or somebody that booked that meeting, have that experience where they said, wow, this is fantastic. Could we track it? I would start going down that rabbit hole and say, okay, it’s in this direction. We don’t know what exactly. We got to validate what that looks like, but it’s something when they have this experience, they book 30% more meetings that they can feel the tangible difference of. When I was using Calendly, I was getting blocked. A lot of times people were in booking meetings, they felt bad about it. Whereas with Savvy Cal, now I have a story, and that story is now actually going to be in their head, the user’s head, and they’re going to tell themselves that story when they’re like, this is why I’m buying Savvy Cal today. Because it makes so much more sense than the other alternatives. They just don’t get me like that. But if you start off with that vague ideal user, it’s so much harder because everything that you give away for free should be tied back to who is that ideal user? What is that ultimate success? And that’s how you build an intentional free model, not just give away random,  Rob Walling:Right, right. Just pick it off a dartboard. That’s cool. And my apologies to Derek Reimer, who certainly is hearing this and absolutely cringing at all my answers. How when you’re the founder of the company, he knows all the answers to these, and I’m kind of like, I’m going to make this one up. I’m not sure if it’s exactly right. So no, that was super cool, man. Thanks for leaning into the thought experiment there. If folks want to check out the book, obviously product led gift.com, or they can head to product led.com/playbook or frankly on Amazon, though your book is available in all the formats, folks would want to find it.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I sit down with Dr. Sherry Walling to talk about our new book Exit Strategy, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret. The Kickstarter for this book launches today. If you want to back it or you’re interested in checking out the tears and seeing all the amazing copy that Leanna Pat wrote for us, head to exit strategy book.com. I hope you’ll consider backing this book. I talk about it in the conversation, but I’m really proud of the end product of what we put together, and we put a ton of time into it. We interviewed a lot of entrepreneurs across different business types. It’s not just about selling SaaS, it’s about selling for the most part, any kind of business. And I’m really excited to get this into the hands of folks like yourself, entrepreneurs who may be thinking about selling, who may be in the midst of selling or who have sold and are trying to think about what’s next. Or even if you are not thinking about selling today, having this knowledge in your head as you build your business can only help you. So exit strategy book.com, it’d be amazing if you decide to back the Kickstarter. And with that, let’s dive into our conversation, doctor, Dr. Sherry Walling. Thanks so much for joining me on the show.  Dr. Sherry Walling:My pleasure.  Rob Walling:So we wrote a book, another book, this one’s called Exit Strategy, and I think a couple clarifications right off the top. It’s not just about selling SaaS, it’s about selling any type of company. We interviewed folks who sold agencies.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, professional service companies, a sort of chain of gyms, brick and mortar businesses. This book was really born out of my conversations with clients over the years who said things like, this is the hardest thing that’s ever happened to me, or I feel like I’m going through a divorce. And that’s not limited to SaaS. The challenge of this process is pretty universal for entrepreneurs going through it.  Rob Walling:And since the book focuses so much on the mental, the emotional, the psychological, the without regret part of before selling, thinking through should I sell, what’s it going to look like during selling? Oh my gosh, this is a pressure cooker, as you said, it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. And then the after recovering working for the acquirer, what to do next. Those things apply broadly across pretty much any type of business that is not just a, if you have look, have a little 10 K side project or some tiny little thing. Is it this agonizing? No, but this is about having a bigger exit and maybe having a team and that kind of stuff. And that applies to a lot of different types of businesses.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s about the story of building a business that becomes very valuable and sellable. People offload apps here and there or do things on a pretty small level, but this is the story about when you build something that is part of you and you put all of the blood, sweat, and tears into making something that’s very valuable, and then what it feels like to go through the process of selling it, of releasing it, putting your life together afterward.  Rob Walling:And there were a lot of really good books about selling your company. John Warlow has one art of selling your company to Andrews wrote before the exit Bo Burham wrote Finish Big. So I guess what’s our unique take? It’s two part question. Why did we decide to write this in the first place? And then what is our unique take that you think we bring to the topic?  Dr. Sherry Walling:I mean, I think the pairing of you as a serial entrepreneur and me as a clinical psychologist is really unique. I think there’s a lot of nuance and mental sort of analysis in this book that is different, or at least we are adding something pretty significant to the conversation when we think about the kinds of processes that people are going through when they’re going through a major transition in the middle of their professional lives. You’ve also been on the front row of hundreds of exits at this point in your work in TinySeed and through your connections with MicroConf. And so I think the number of reps that you and I have done together from very different perspectives is unique and really shapes what we’re offering in this book.  Rob Walling:And and I, it felt like we were having similar conversations over and over where you were like, Hey, one of my clients is thinking about selling or going through the sale process or has gone through the sales process and this is happening. And I’m like, well, didn’t that happen to someone else? Or that did happen to a friend of mine that I know through MicroConf. And it was like we would get asked questions of like, well, what books should I read or what resources are there around this topic? And it kept being like, well, obviously there’s these good books, but they don’t have maybe the very specific opinions that you and I have about how to try to do this well from a mental health perspective and realistically without Regret is in the subtitle for a reason.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think what’s also interesting is that not only have we been in this sort of consulting seat in las, but we’ve been through an exit. You’ve been through it directly with Drip, and I’ve been through it as your partner, as your significant other. And I think that’s a piece that is often overlooked in business books is the relational impact of some of these transitions, not just on the founder, not just on the founder and their team, but on their family. And this book isn’t a heavy, heavy focus on that, but it is woven through in its, I think really shaped by our experience of having done the reps ourselves and then done them on behalf of other people.  Rob Walling:Yeah, there’s definitely a running thread through this book of A, how difficult this process actually is, and B, how much of a toll it takes on not only the founder, the entrepreneur, but on the people around them, their family, significant other, and so on,  Dr. Sherry Walling:And that it doesn’t have to be that way. So the default setting is this is hard and can be surprisingly destructive, but it does not have to be that way. So I think that’s the point of the book is to help offer the ability for people to open their eyes, look to see what’s happening, do some self-assessment, and then have some tools to help make more aware and more intentional choices about how they go through this process.  Rob Walling:And if someone’s starting a business today and they’re not going to sell it here in the next 12, 18, 24 months, I still feel like there’s value in experiencing this journey alongside the entrepreneurs that we interviewed for the book. What did we enter? 15 people, 20 people. I mean, we did a lot of, it wasn’t just out of in my head. I mean, we did a ton of legwork to pull it in, and there’s a lot of stories, a lot of quotes.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think this book is actually about how to have a healthy relationship with your business, and that’s where it’s relevant to anyone at any phase of their entrepreneurial journey. I think it would be a super great book to read at the beginning because it talks about this balance between going all in and being very careful and very attentive to what the business needs from you and how to protect it well, and how to think about your team and also on the other end of the spectrum, this de-identification between your selfhood and the business that you’re running. And if you can strike that balance well early in your business, I think you are just set up for success in a lot of ways, not just in your exit, but in your mental wellbeing and balance throughout the course of the journey.  Rob Walling:And the book’s not out yet. And the reason we’re talking about it today is the day this episode goes live, our Kickstarter for this book goes live. And so folks can head to exit strategy book.com and there’ll be a link there where they can go straight to the Kickstarter page and they can back the book. We’re going to have it in three formats. We’re going to have a hardcover run like I did with SaaS Playbook where we have an offset printer. It’s just amazing. It’s like the same printers who print for any big publisher. And so the quality of the book is just really outstanding.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Do you have it there with you? Yeah, I was like, I should have it in my, this is  Rob Walling:A digital, I have a digital copy of it that is a print on demand version, but it’s so neat to finally have it here in my hands. And it’s a meaty book. It’s a couple hundred pages, right? 250 pages or so. But with the Kickstarter, we’re going to have an audio version that you and I are going to read together. Isn’t that  Dr. Sherry Walling:Sweet? It’s going to be adorable.  Rob Walling:It’s going to be so adorable.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’m sure we won’t have any arguments about it.  Rob Walling:Nope. During I’m going to leave you, Josh, please edit a lot of any arguments out, but I do like to riff on the audiobook. We haven’t recorded it yet, but that’s something I’m looking forward to doing with you is kind of riffing on different things. And then of course we have an electronic, like a PDF epub version, but in addition to that, we’re offering things that we’ve never offered before, right?  Dr. Sherry Walling:All kinds of opportunities to hang out with us either in some q and a sessions where you can come and ask questions about your business, your exit, things that you’re thinking about to one or both of us. I think we have an option where both of us are involved all the way to the opportunity to come to beautiful Minneapolis in the summer and do a founder retreat with the two of us together. So the dates and all the details about that are on the site, but I am personally really excited about doing it that way and the kinds of interactions that it allows us to have with people that we might not necessarily bump up against in our day-to-day lives.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I would agree. At one point on this very podcast, it was probably 2021, I did a call for anyone who is in the middle of an exit or really on the cusp of an exit. If you’re thinking about selling, just email me and I will send you a 20 minute zoom link and I’ll zoom with any and everyone who’s going to do it. And part of that was I wanted to talk to more founders who were doing it. But the other thing is I said, this is one of the most important moments slash transactions of your life. And I talked to so many people who were like, I’m going to sell this. I started this kind of listening to the podcast and thought it’d be a little side project, and I got an offer for $9 million, and I was just like, what? And so I had these great conversations and part of those anonymized and everything going to the knowledge bank of writing this book, but I realized through those conversations even more the need for this. You and I’ve been talking about writing this book for three, four years at this point, and it took us, what about a year and a half, I guess, to get it all put together?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, it was such a fun process. There’s obviously lots of different ways to write books, but because we spend so much time talking to each other, podcasting and things like that, I really enjoy the process of having a really detailed outline and then going chapter by chapter and basically recording audio of it and transcribing that and then turning that into the written word. So I think it’s a fun way to collaborate together. And so there really is a mixture of both of our voices in really every chapter, even though some chapters are more based on my expertise and others are based more on your expertise, there’s still this weighing in and question asking of the other person, which I think helps it to be a much better product because you have thoughtful questions that are guiding the development of content.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I’m super, super proud of this book. I think it turned out really well, potentially, I hate to say it, but almost better than I could have expected when we started, which is how I like  Dr. Sherry Walling:Wow, look at you in the low expectations.  Rob Walling:I know, but I like having, I don’t know. I like it when it’s an end product and it’s like, yeah, I know this is dialed in. Something that I really like about the book, as I said earlier, there’s the before, the during and the after your exit. Those are kind of the three sections we have. And one part of the before chapter two, when is it time to go? And we look at external and internal cues for thinking about when you may want to exit. And I remember putting this chapter together, and one of the things that is interesting is that you and I have seen so many people sell that these things just kind of rolled. It was like, let’s brainstorm. Why do people sell? Boom, boom, boom, boom, and then run this list by other people I know who’ve sold. Are we missing any of these? So I feel just really good about the list we put together. Some of the external cues we mentioned are, you’ve built something amazing, the business needs more capital, you’re no longer the best person to run the business. The competitive landscape shifts a change in life status, and another opportunity arises just to give folks an idea of the kind of, and then we dive obviously deep into each of those and how those might come about and how to think about them if you’re in that situation.  Dr. Sherry Walling:And also assessing what are helpful motivations to sell and where are, so we talk about some of the internal cues like existential restlessness or energy levels, some even burnout, and when maybe those things lead you to want to sell because you want out, but they’re not always the best for you in the long run or the best for the business. And so thinking through just how to be an observation, an observer of your own mental internal process, and then what to do if you maybe want out, but don’t necessarily, it doesn’t make sense to sell right now. So we sort of dive into some of those options.  Rob Walling:And in typical Dr. Walling fashion, this is something I’ve never done in my books. We have making it real at the end of each chapter where it’s like, look, I just told you a bunch of really interesting things and now there are questions to think about and to journal and to take action on. So  Dr. Sherry Walling:In my last book Testing two worlds, I worked at the traditional publisher and they really pushed me on this. They were like, your stories are great. Thank you for the wisdom, but what do we do about it? And I, frankly, the challenge of helping people really apply it to their specific situation. So it’s all fine and good to absorb content, but if you can’t do anything with it, then it’s really not in your best highest service. So we’ve worked pretty hard on those sections to give you at least some journaling prompts and thoughtful questions that will help you to go deeper with some of the content that we’ve presented.  Rob Walling:And throughout the book, we try to set expectations of what an exit might look like. And I find that we were repeated over and over so much that eventually we had to take it out at a certain point of we just can’t keep saying this, but this is really hard. This is going to be really hard. Isn’t this really hard? That really hard? That felt like a message of the book. Why do you think that we have to say that so often?  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s such a dream outcome. I think the stories that persist on social media or Twitter of the founder who sells for a huge bucket of money and rides off into the sunset or starts a farm in Austin, but it has this glow to it, and I just think that it is kind of giving birth. It has a great outcome. Babies are great, but it’s a grizzly bloody messy process. And because we’ve so glorified the end result, I don’t know that we collectively as an entrepreneurial community have told the truth about the process.  Rob Walling:And I think, I know for me, a chunk of the entrepreneurs that I talk to, the founders I talk to who are about exit, I’ll tell them it’s going to be really hard. And I’ve had people tell me, yeah, not for me. It’s not going to be hard for me and then come out together.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I got it. I’m not attached to my business. I’m rational. I’m objective.  Rob Walling:This won’t be hard.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’m not that worried about it.  Rob Walling:I’m so prepared. And then come out the other side like, oh my gosh, you were right. And it’s like, I know it really is as hard.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It always, it starts relatively simply. I mean, the wonderful story is somebody gets an LOI and you agree quickly on the terms and it just feels like it’s going to be smooth sailing. But inevitably there’s some series of disruptions in the deal that require sleeveless nights and long conversations with lawyers. And it’s just the way it goes  Rob Walling:Inevitably is pretty much my experience. And the interesting thing is as entrepreneurs, we do hard things and we think as you said, that it’s like we can logic our way out of it or that we can just, we’ve done hard things in the past and I know that I can do it, but you get in this position where it’s like, all right, I’ve signed this letter of intent for $10 million and we’re going to close in 45 days, 45 days. I could do anything for 45 days. And then suddenly you find that you’re like, whoa, there is a lot of uncertainty here. And whoa, there are a lot of people that are kind of pissing me off here with the pushback on the thing and asking for the stuff. And you start to get in your own head. People start sleeping. There are entrepreneurs who you can’t sleep so stressed about it. And then you get towards the end and everything’s up in the air still.  Dr. Sherry Walling:And then it’s not 45 days, it’s 50 days, it’s 60 days. It’s the lawyers on vacation. Yeah.  Rob Walling:And so that is something we talk about. We have, I mean obviously there’s what, 14 chapters in the book and only two of them are really about deal structure and deal points because again, there are really good books like the Art of Selling Your Company that cover that type of stuff. So the vast majority of the book is thinking through whether to do it and how to do it well, and then how to be on the other side and ask what’s next. But I really like in chapter seven, it’s called collateral Damage, minimizing negative Impact. And we talk about minimizing negative impact to your mental health, your physical health, your family, your team, your company, and the deal itself. And then we have specific strategies for that. It’s learn how to time travel, take on an exit project, go on that vacation, let your partner in on your emotional state and other things. A lot of those came from you. I mean, I was pulling out the, here’s all the collateral damage it can do, but really the strategies for how to minimize those or how to stay healthy, a lot of that comes in your voice, a lot of your work.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It really is a challenge to construct some internal buffers around your own anxiety, especially for entrepreneurs who have often used their anxiety or their agitation as fuel to get things done. But in this process, you can only get done what is on your to-do list in that moment. And then you are waiting on all of these other people, on the buyer, on the broker, on the whoever else. And so it’s a really abrupt, difficult lesson in holding agitation and anxiety when there’s nothing really effective to be done with it because there are things that are happening or that you have to wait for that you can’t control. And so a lot of these strategies are around what to do with that energy, frankly, how to not let it eat you alive and not let it spin out of control in a way that hurts the people around you and leaves you trying to push the deal forward or being thoughtless or reactive because you are uncomfortable and agitated.  Rob Walling:I like that you bring up that point of there are things outside of your control that you just can’t do anything about. Because again, as entrepreneurs, as founders, we start companies, some of us because we want to control everything. And suddenly you’re in the middle of a process where it’s like some clown shoes, lawyer on the other end, as you said, is on vacation or is taken four days to turn things around and you’re like, dude, this is $10 million. This is the biggest thing of my life. This is my life. But it’s just another day for them. It’s just another deal.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Just another email.  Rob Walling:And we talked through in chapter 10, we have the 3:00 AM what ifs. And all of these quotes are things that you and I have either heard from entrepreneurs or we heard in the interviews as we talked to entrepreneurs, things like, what if my team falls apart? What if the deal falls apart? What if I’m not up for this? What if this deal is my only chance? What if I take a bad deal? And there are more, there are a lot of 3:00 AM what ifs. Another thing that I don’t think is talked about enough is life after the exit. We have a chapter called Purgatory that is sad. It’s about working for the acquirer and reporting to a boss. You lose control of your team, of your company, but there are also a upsides to it as well. And that was something that I am really glad we covered.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think this question of life after the exit is maybe some of the content that I’m personally most proud of that feels like a real contribution to this conversation around exits that I just haven’t seen dealt with as thoughtfully and as carefully as we’ve dealt with it. And I think coming from my life as a psychologist, there is this deep appreciation for what it means to be going through a really significant life-changing developmental disruption at a time when your peers aren’t going through that exits are such extraordinary events, they’re just not commonly occurring. And so it’s like getting divorced or sending a kid to college or watching your parents pass away. It’s this major reworking of your identity and what you do during the day and what matters to you. But you’re not doing that along with your peer group. You and I know lots of people whose kids are going to college because that’s the age group that we’re in. And so this idea of going through a major developmental transition alone is pretty unusual and kind of extraordinary in the human experience. And so I think giving people some grounding in that, some understanding and some perspective about why this reworking of your entire life midstream is so challenging and then what to do about it, how to avoid the isolation and how to avoid the kind of spin out that can happen when people lose perspective about just how significant this transition is.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that you call that out. A lot of people have kids who go to college. A lot of people have a parent who passes away. A lot of people get married, get divorced, have children, whatever. There’s a lot of events that completely can turn your life upside down. And so few people sell a company and so few people, I mean almost no one else is selling a company when you are. And what’s interesting is during the sale, again, there is only so many people you can talk to. We do have a whole chapter on support team and how to put together people to support you, but afterwards, there can be this sense of, shouldn’t I be happy now? Hey, my company was really stressing me out. I don’t have to work on that anymore and I have this huge pile of cash in the bank, but now I’m unhappy. We have this expression whining on the yacht. It’s like you can’t just go on Twitter and say, man, sold my company for $10 million. Life sucks. And I’m so sad every day  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’m so bored and lonely.  Rob Walling:Totally. Even if that’s really the case. And we talk a lot about that of first day of the rest of your life, like how to recover from this and how to find a peer groups. There are other entrepreneurs who’ve gone through this  Dr. Sherry Walling:And to re-anchor into meaning you’re getting a second act, you’ve built something, you’ve gone through the whole journey and then sold it. And it is an immense opportunity to use the phrase that from David Brooks to climb a second mountain to do something else that is interesting and meaningful and valuable to you and to your family and to the world around you. But people have a complicated relationship with that. Sometimes people rush, they can’t tolerate this in-between space, the patients of really considering what’s next. So they buy a company before they’ve finished selling their other company, we tell this story in the book, or they get so churned around about what to do next that they spend years spinning their wheels, not doing anything. So this conversation about what to do next is really important because it does help people re-anchor to what they want their lives to be about in this next iteration.  Rob Walling:And we talk about it in, well, we talk about purgatory of, Hey, you’re working for the acquirer still, where it’s this weird in-between of I’ve sold, I have this money, I don’t control the company anymore and I got to figure out now how to be an employee. But then once you do have that break, assuming you move on from that at some point after an earnout, then we talk about how to recover, how to rest up, how to physically recover, connect with yourself and as you’re saying, take stock of the past, embrace the present and look ahead and ask yourself what’s next and with what’s next, there are a couple traps we call out that we’ve seen over and over. It’s the prove I can do it again, trap and the sail away forever trap. Why do people fall into these same traps over and over?  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s so deeply part of us, this story that we create about who we are because of the business that we’ve built. And so the proof I can do it again is about, look how good at entrepreneurship I am. Look how creative look, how it’s just look who I am based on this outcome that I can create. And the pressure to try to do it again just as to reinforce your perception of your identity and then the sail away forever. Ever trap is a little bit like, I don’t need any of it. I’m just going to go retire on a beach in Mexico, which is also not true for the vast majority of entrepreneurs. It’s not an accurate read of themselves. So it’s about needing too much to be an entrepreneur in the prove. I can do it again, sense or not having a proper respect or reverence for how deeply you are a maker and a creator in the sail away forever trip. So finding your balance between those two edges of the spectrum.  Rob Walling:And of course, we also, I like this chapter title, what do you Do with a big pile of money? We talk about how money reduces your circle appears and how it changes your friends and your family relationships and even romantic relationships. So obviously this is not a book on specific investing advice, but we do dabble a little bit in that as well. I really liked one quote in that chapter where a founder said, I had all this money and traditionally I’d been investing in index funds and just kind of following the basic financial advice that you would do. And now I had all this money, so I invest like a rich person and started making risky bets and investing in private equity and this stuff that’s not necessarily, it’s like you still Vanguard Index funds or Schwab index funds are still really, really good, even if you have 10, 20, $30 million that you need to invest.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Well, again, that speaks to this identity piece, right? I was a scrappy founder and now I’m someone with a big bank account. So doesn’t that mean that I act or hold myself in this different way that my identity shifts now that I’m a rich person or now that I’m a post exit founder? And that’s not necessarily true. Your identity is your identity. You can weave it through these changes, but we have this idea that we put on these certain roles and then act accordingly to those roles. And so I think the theme of the book really is about being able to step back and to see your pull to some of those default settings, and then the ability to choose whether that setting really fits or doesn’t, whether there is a way that rich people invest or not.  Rob Walling:And then to cap us off, I’m not going to tell the story, I’m just going to tease it, but one of the cringes stories in the entire book is when you ran over my original Andy Warhol in your Porsche,  Dr. Sherry Walling:That did happen,  Rob Walling:And I’m going to leave that there. I’m a person who does not identify as a rich person, and yet there you go. That actually happened.

I’m your host, Rob Walling. In this episode, I talk with Andy Kim. He’s the co-founder, co-owner of a SaaS app called Rado that’s at Trot two. Andy acquired the majority of the business from the original developer that built it, and rado is in an interesting position in the sense of once they acquire customers, their retention is extremely high. But most people who need the tool are either unaware they have a problem or problem aware, but they’re not even solution or product or most aware. And we talk about that dynamic in the show of how difficult that can be and how it can be a bit of a headwind to get over. But to Andy’s credit, he’s making progress and growing the business month to month and has figured out some interesting approaches for getting around that. Before we dive into the episode, I have a Kickstarter that’s launching a week from today. It’s for my new book that I co-wrote with my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling. A book is called Exit Strategy, the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Selling Your Business Without Regret. Sherry and I have taken our combined many, many years of experience going through exits, counseling founders, through exits, and it’s not just focused on SaaS, it’s all types of businesses, but obviously there’s a light emphasis on SaaS because of course we do have more of a network in the space. But if you’d consider backing the Kickstarter, you can head to exit strategy book.com and click back the Kickstarter button and we will be in touch the moment it goes live. Could really use your support first. 24 hours is a great signal to everyone that if there’s a lot of backers, then we tend to get more. So exit strategy book.com if you’re interested in that. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Andy. Andy Kim, welcome to the show. Hey,  Andy Kim:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Yeah, thanks for joining me today, man. So you run rado, that’s Trot two, and the H one is easy and secure. Go links, quickly share and remember links by shortening lengthy URLs. Try for free. the hell is a GoLink?  Andy Kim:That’s a good question. So most people probably have not heard of a GoLink, but the way to think of it is a UR L shortener. The consumer version of this is Bitly or Tiny URL, but GoLink specifically only work for people within the same organization. So whereas you would use Bitly to shorten our URL for marketing purposes to the general public where anyone can click on that link, goal links only work if you and I work at the same company. And the purpose is really to share resources between each  Rob Walling:Other. Got it. So folks understand you are a SaaS, you charge per seat, right? Per user. And when I think of Bitly and what was the other one, tiny URLI think of these big kind of freemium, consumer cheap plays, but you are much more on the enterprise side.  Andy Kim:Yep.  Rob Walling:Isn’t that right? Okay. So talk us through how that, it’s like two sides of a different coin.  Andy Kim:Yeah, and if you remember, Rob, when we were actually interviewing for TinySeed, you were questioning why do companies even pay for this, right? It’s an interesting phenomenon, but the reality is this is what I call enterprise software tool that works. The larger the company is, the larger the problem becomes. So there’s really three use cases I’d say, and then individual use. But the way that we break it down between those three, sometimes there’s good overlap, but really the fundamental problem is, hey, Rob sent me a resource three months ago and I don’t remember where he sent it, email Slack. He might have told me over a video conference, but Go Links basically helps you remember where to go because a human readable link most of the time, that’s a lot easier to recall.  Rob Walling:Got it. So as an example, then if I wanted to implement Go Links in for TinySeed, I would install a browser plugin, and then I sign into my Go Links account as a TinySeed employee. And there’s what is TinySeed team? Six or seven of us. So six or seven of us would all sign in, and then I can type in to my browser. Let’s say I’m in Chrome TinySeed dot com slash some internal short code, like a R’S deck. And we know an R’S deck is the deck. That is not a great example, but some type of short code. And now that has to then point somewhere, right? It points to a Dropbox location or some URL doesn’t store the files themselves. It literally is just a hop.  Andy Kim:We don’t store or host anything. Yeah. Got it. And actually you would just type in Go slash Einar file and that would be it. You don’t even have to do the TinySeed portion.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Oh, go. So it doesn’t need to be a TLD. It’s literally because the Chrome browser is  Andy Kim:Correct.  Rob Walling:The Chrome plugin, I’m sorry, is going Ah, go slash a R’s important resource.  Andy Kim:Yeah.  Rob Walling:So is this a real problem? Who’s paying for this? I guess it’s like who uses this? Someone invented this and it’s somehow popular. What’s the story?  Andy Kim:Yeah, this was started back in the early to mid two thousands at Google. We actually have a very cool interview with a couple of the people that started this at Google on our website. You can check that out. But basically folks at Google were asking to set up these redirects. So they would say, Hey, I have a holiday party. I’m planning for all of Google. It’s really hard to communicate this to 10, 20, 50,000 people and it’s going to be go slash holiday party 2007 for example. And they communicate that to Google, and these engineers were setting up these redirects internally for Google and they thought, let’s set up a service for this so that anyone can just self-serve themselves. And what ended up happening was as this just exploded in popularity at Google, folks left Google, they would go to LinkedIn or Netflix or any other large tech company and they would set the service up for themselves. And that’s really what happened with John, my co-founder as well. He worked at Google, went to a startup, wanted go links, set it up for them, other folks kept on coming back to him and asking him to set it up for their startup. And he’s like, bang idea. Let’s make this a service.  Rob Walling:Got it. So then this is independent. The concept of Go Links has been built by hand inside Google and other Silicon Valley startups, and then Rado is a self-serve version of not Not right, but it’s a SaaS version of the same thing that John kind of obfuscated out. It’s such a trip, it sounds like still to this day, I am like, don’t know. I don’t feel like I need this myself. I don’t feel like I need this, but it’s obvious you have clients like what Figma? I mean you have big enterprise, any other notables,  Andy Kim:A couple of Fortune 500 companies for sure.  Rob Walling:So it’s for them to pay for it and your pricing’s on your website, it’s a $3 per user. Got it. I can just extrapolate to, these are not small contracts, these are enterprise size contracts, so it’s obviously for there to be enterprise contracts around this is something that if you haven’t used it, it doesn’t feel like a pain point, but when you use it and get kind of addicted to it or get used to it perhaps that the next company go to, you’re like, I got to have this. Is that really what?  Andy Kim:Definitely.  Rob Walling:Okay.  Andy Kim:That’s definitely it. I mean, we can see it in our user base. So there’s, depending on the company, there are 20 to 30% of users that use this more than five times a day. Anything that they’re going to, they’re using a goal link to get there. There are others that may be more like you who only use it once a month if that, and it’s because I as a power user sent you a link. But what we find is that the adoption rate of this within a company doesn’t stop at 20 or 30%. It’s like 70% average usage per month for all of the employees at a particular company. Once they’ve fully adopted this, it’s a daily weekly tool that folks use regularly. It just becomes part of your normal workflow. You don’t look to bookmark things, you just know that a Go link exists. So think of it as a bookmark placer, think of it as a memory helper, all of that.  Rob Walling:Interesting. Before we get further, I want to dig into the story of rado and how you’ve been growing it, but can you give us an idea of where the business stands today?  Andy Kim:Yeah, we’re profitable, which is great. We’re six figures in revenue. The story generally is John built an awesome product. It stands up on its own. We have SOC two, type two, we have a bunch of different services including SSO. We have a Slack app. So all of the pieces are there that John built, but he was a classic founder who focused more on the product itself rather than a little bit more on the sales and marketing piece of it. And that’s kind of where I come into the picture and that’s kind of where we are today, which is you’ll talk about probably some of the issues that we may have, but that’s the problem we’re trying to solve for is how do we get awareness out there about what Go Links are and also why Trato is the best option for someone who is looking for Go Links. And that’s really the crux of where we are today.  Rob Walling:That is, that’s the next thing I want to talk about is you have, I talk about on this podcast, five stages of awareness from Eugene Schwartz and its unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware in that order. For most people, they’re just unaware, like I was unaware of this before you interviewed a TinySeed. But then there is a different subset that is problem aware, and the problem that they have is, I used Go Links at insert name of startups, I’m at the new place of employment, and my problem is I really want those, right? But they probably aren’t aware that there is a solution to this, and I imagine they think I need to get engineering to build it. We had a custom one at the other thing and the IT department or whatever maintained it. So how do, as a founder who’s trying to grow this business deal with that of, Hey, because in a perfect world, you’re at stage one and two, you want to be at four and five, you want to be at product, everyone’s product aware, Hubspotter, Salesforce or Shopify or everybody’s most aware, whatever, it never happens, but you’re all the way at the other end, so it feels like a headwind. How do you think about that as a founder?  Andy Kim:Yeah, I think if we were trying to get every company in the world to adopt Go Links, that would feel like an impossible task. Just boiling the ocean. You’re never going to be able to get the attention span of everyone out there to be able to do that. So that’s not something that we really think about. We’re trying to solve for, Hey, folks that have already used Go Links say, and you can pull folks that used to work at the Googles and Netflix is the big tech companies of the world, and oh, they work at a new company now, and that becomes our ideal customer profile. These people probably have used Gox before, and in the best case scenario, they’ve loved Gox. I’ll give you one example. We reached out to the CTO of a very large tech company, a Fortune 500 company, and they didn’t have Go Links and responded immediately to a very cold email outreach and they have I think north of 10,000 employees, and it was an instant conversation. He was selling Go links to the other people on his team on that call. It was great. Now we have to go and close that deal, and there’s other considerations like budget and timing and all of this, but that’s the kind of power of, Hey, if you’ve used Go Links before and it was part of your workflow, this is an easier sell than most. But the problem is if you haven’t used Go Links, then you fall into Rob Wallings world where you’re like, why the heck would anyone buy this thing?  Rob Walling:A real customer education challenge, right? In that because you’re not inventing a new category, the category exists, but it’s not a big category yet. It’s not DocuSign like electronic signature or scheduling links or marketing automation or something where it’s this massive thing with dozens of competitors, if not hundreds. It’s this, and this is a conversation, and I’ve had when you interviewed for TinySeed was like, how big can this get? How many pasta? I mean, I guess over the course of 20 years, as people move to a new job and moved a new job, it’ll eventually propagate. But today, how do you think about that as a mostly bootstrap startup? I’m presuming since you’re in TinySeed that you want to get two, seven or eight figures in a RR. Yeah. And how do you think about that?  Andy Kim:Yeah, I think what’s exciting for us is that what we’re seeing is true. Our target market continues to be technology companies, but there are non-technology companies, say in automotive, industrial healthcare government, and that is wide open greenfield opportunity for us. And they are, I would say, in a sense, starved of productivity tools like Go Links that technology companies use every day and take for granted DocuSign. CRMs are just one classic example of that, but there’s so many other niche kind of productivity tools that if you work at a tech company, you’re like, oh yeah, of course this works. Of course this works. And that kind of migration from technology companies to non-tech seeing that live in our pipeline, and that’s what I’m most excited about because you’re right, it’d be one thing if it was kind of slowly moving across tech companies. That’d be a slow growing market, but because we have non-tech companies adopting this as well, that’s kind of what I’m most excited about. For example, we have a nonprofit customer who said, truly when new employees join and they use Go Links, and they were working at other nonprofit before, it is just magic. It just works. And that’s kind of the magic that we’re trying to achieve. Not just that tech companies, but non-tech companies.  Rob Walling:There are actually quite a few products and TinySeed that are hard to get the deal signed, but the retention is through the roof. It’s like there’s net negative churn, frankly. And it feels like Rado is that kind of product. Would you that? Yeah,  Andy Kim:I would agree. I mean, we have customers who have been with us for four or five years now, and the companies are growing, which is great for us. Again, we charge per seat, but we see the, hey, new people join the company. They start using Go Links, and it just expands the overall pie for us. And that’s exciting for us, and that’s what we’re really trying to achieve.  Rob Walling:And so I’d imagine that your marketing or slash go to market motion has to all be outbound because I can’t imagine there’s much search volume or even much conversation in Facebook groups or Quora or Reddit, all the marketing. I have 20 B2B marketing approaches in SaaS Playbook, and I’m guessing 19 of them don’t work. I mean, I’m sure in person event there’s some things that could work, but it seems like you would have to be going out there finding people.  Andy Kim:Yeah, that’s what we’re really trying to solve for is what is the repeatable marketing funnel that works for us? We’ve tried outbound email, we’ve tried Google AdWords, of course, we’ve tried all the different kind of playbook items, and we’re still really searching for what is the best solution that says, I can put in X amount of effort and time and money resulting in why leads that part of the funnel we have not yet solved for yet. And that’s part of the journey that we’re on.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s the stage of a lot of most listeners to this show are in that stage of trying to figure out what’s the repeatable thing that I can scale up. I remember it was interesting in some of my earlier software slash SaaS companies, I found one or two channels that I could really crank up and really get a lot of volume out of. When I launched Drip, I remember being like, yeah, I’ve got to find that one or two thing, one or two. And it never happened. It was just a bunch of things. I don’t think there was a single kind of traffic source, so to speak, that was more than 15% of our monthly trials. So we had, oh, Yeah. And it was all time I was running, I was dealing with Facebook ads. I was paying somebody to run those. We were doing SEO, I was doing podcast tours, we were had an affiliate program. There was all kinds of stuff. And it was just all that’s great for kind of diversification so that no single source can crush you. It also kind of sucks because I had to manage all of that, and we were, at the time, we were a four person team, five person team. And by the end, by time we sold, we were 10, but oh, we were doing cold outbound as well. I mean, we were doing all of it, and it was all kind of working. It was all working well enough, and as a big, it got the snowball going, and the growth was really good. I mean, that’s one of the reasons we got acquired was we were picking up market share so fast, but I found it frustrating to be on this small team and be like, I don’t want to manage all this crap. I needed a marketing team of six or eight people probably, and it was me, halftime, and a full-time junior marketer, and then our customer success person halftime. And it was always frustrating. It is not a myth to be like, Ooh, you’re going to find one or two things that work, but it’s really hard. It takes a lot. It doesn’t just take a lot of trial and error. It just doesn’t work in all spaces or with all categories where you’re just going to find that single silver bullet, so to speak.  Andy Kim:Yeah, I agree. This is actually a common topic for our TinySeed Masterminds group actually of, okay, we have a product that we think is working now, how do we reach the right people at the right time? And I think that’s actually some of the value in the community as well, right? Because I mean, I just use the Slack channel all the time to ping people and be like, Hey, we’re thinking about trying this. We are doing this. And just people that have been on that journey before is just super helpful to get all of their thoughts.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s definitely helpful to learn from those who came before you. That’s whether, if you’re in TinySeed how to do that. If you’re in the MicroComp orbit that’s MicroComp Connect, or even listening to this podcast and hearing the experience of folks and reading the books and all that, hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business. But if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results. And longtime listener, Chaz Yun hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his hire quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used lemon.io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. So I want to switch it up a little bit and ask you about the, I’d say the unorthodox way that you came about being a co-founder of this company. So your co-founder John built it and got a first big customer in 2020, and then you came in, it was either 2023 or 2024 last year, and you bought into the business and he’s now a minority owner. TinySeed obviously owns our percentage, but tell us a little bit about how that went down and who came up with the idea. Again, it’s unorthodox, and I like to tell stories on this show to give people an idea of, oh, that’s possible. I didn’t know you could do that. Right? And then when I heard your story, I was like, huh. Yeah, it’s an interesting way. So walk us through what happened.  Andy Kim:Yeah. So I have been interested in my own startup for the longest time. I can’t even begin to tell you how long it’s been. And part of the problem was how do I stand something up? How do I get the first customer? How do I get the first product out the door? How do I get first interest? And that to me was a big enough barrier that it felt like diving off the deep end. What ended up happening was I’ve been looking for businesses to buy on various marketplaces, and one that came across for me on Quiet Light was John’s business, this Rado business. And John’s part of the story is really, he built this thing to be sustainable, but he has a full-time job as a software engineer, and this business just wasn’t getting enough care and attention that it needed. And admittedly, he probably stubbed his toe with other partners in the past, but with me buying in, it’s a real capital commitment to growing this thing. And I think at the end of the day, what mattered the most and continues to matter the most to us is the level of trust that John and I have built over the last year plus of, Hey, John, I’m taking care of his baby, basically his company, and taking it forward. And he’s there as support on critical issues that he has the experience and knowledge about, and it’s actually worked out better than I could have really imagined for I think both of our cases. And it’s something that I’m super happy about and excited that it’s kind of turned out the way that it has.  Rob Walling:Did you and John know each other before this?  Andy Kim:No, we did not.  Rob Walling:Okay. How did you find each other?  Andy Kim:Through Quiet Light, the broker?  Rob Walling:Ah, very nice. I didn’t know that Quiet light would do majority, but not full acquisitions.  Andy Kim:Yeah, I think at the time I also wanted to acquire the full business, but in conversations as John and I built trust, I think John wanted to retain a certain percentage, and in retrospect, it was probably the right outcome for both of us to make sure that our incentives were aligned. So he’s still involved  Rob Walling:With the business.  Andy Kim:I mean, we used to catch up every week. It then turned into every two weeks. Now it’s on a monthly basis. But yeah, I ping him all the time on Slack and bother him with questions, and yeah, it’s been  Rob Walling:Great. As we move towards wrapping up, I have question for you that I like to ask of a lot of guests that come on the show, and it’s, in your experience running, growing, building this business, what has been the hardest thing about it? And you can either say overall like, Ooh, it’s been X, Y, Z challenge. Or if there’s a moment where you were like, this is so I’m not having fun at all. You can also just go to a moment.  Andy Kim:I don’t have a moment, but it is the general feeling of not knowing what the right answers are. You go to school and you’re like, okay, I got an A or B on that test. You go to work and you’re like, okay, I know I’m doing well or I’m not doing well. You know what the company’s doing, but you’re a smaller part of it when you’re at the size of company that we are. And it seems like at times we’re flailing in a large ocean of everything else that’s going on. The real question is how do you know what your North Star is? How do you know that you’re making progress against that, and how do you try to figure out the basic problems of going from basically nothing to a company with processes and with people and with all of that? So I think the general frustration of the question is all of the effort that we’re putting together on this thing worth what we think it’s going to be worth, that’s the real crux of the problem. And again, on the marketing side, you can truly spend unlimited amounts of money into all of the various methodologies and end up with nothing. This is not a game where you are guaranteed results, and I think that general kind of frustration is the toughest part of this entire journey.  Rob Walling:The uncertainty, yeah. It’s not just the money, it’s your opportunity cost, man. You could get a job working for a company in the Bay Area and make lots of money, and yet you are basically, I’m guessing, taking a below market salary as most of us do, and just trying to figure it out. And that is a real, it’s a gamble, kind of the traditional, maybe Silicon Valley or YC founder is like a 23-year-old founder doing it or having a this and that, and there’s a reason for that stereotype. Most of the MicroConf, TinySeed startups of the rest of his ecosystem tends to skew a little older, let’s say thirties and forties, some folks in their fifties. But the further you get on and the more you’re making three 50 grand a year as an engineer, senior engineer for Facebook or something, it becomes really hard to leave that for the uncertainty of a startup. And I think it is. I mean, it’s just one of the big concerns that folks have.  Andy Kim:Definitely the uncertainty though also makes it a little bit more fun when things do go your way and you do figure it out. And truly, I think that we would have some difficulty if it wasn’t for the TinySeed community, just like being able to call you or call a and r or the mastermind group that we have. It’s just super helpful to be like, okay, I’m not in this alone, and here’s how we’re all going to get through it together.  Rob Walling:Being alone in the uncertainty is even harder and being alone and having a spouse or a family in the uncertainty, and it’s like, well, I’m going to spend all these nights and weekends for at least you’re able to do it full time, hopefully mostly during the day. But the boots, I bootstrapped five companies and then raise money for TinySeed, but four of them, I did effectively nights and weekends, and it was not fun. I had young kids and I was telling Sherry, my wife, so all this time I’m putting into this thing. By the time I was on the second one, the first one had made enough money that it was like, okay, I’m going to do this again. And I kind of know what I’m doing now and now Fred. But the first one was a real tough sell. When our friends were like, let’s go to happy hour. And I’m like, I would love to. Or I’d go and I’d leave early. I was like, dude, I got to get home and write some code on this thing. These are the trade-offs, the unseen, unseen trade-offs of entrepreneurship, but specifically bootstrapping of any kind is just a lot of grinding hours. So Andy Kim, thanks so much for joining me on the show. If folks want to keep up with you on X Twitter, you are at rado hq. And of course, if folks want to check out Trot, thanks again.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I’m going to be answering your questions. Well, maybe not your particular questions, but if you want me to answer your particular question in a future episode, go to startups For, the Rest Of Us dot com, click ask a question. In the top nab, you could send me an audio, a video, a text question. Today I’m going to be covering more later stage questions. I believe the earliest stage company is seven KMRR and the latest stage has 25 or 30 employees. So this is where it gets fun. I ask for these kinds of questions on X Twitter and folks showed up and delivered, so I’m excited to dig into them today. Before I do that, I want to let you know MicroConf Remote is going live again on November 20th. The focus is on early stage marketing. We’re going to do it in single day three speakers plus q and a after each talk, plus our founder by founder sessions microcomp.com/remote to see all the extra bonuses my team is including. If you purchase by November 7th, it’s a hundred percent online. It’s from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern, and of course we record the sessions in case that time doesn’t work for you. Microcom remote is our low priced but high value three hour event we do about every six months and usually one focuses on early stage marketing, the other focuses on early stage sales and then one on the November 20th, as I’ve said, is going to lean heavily into early stage marketing. So microcom.com/remote if you’re interested. I hope to see you there. And with that, let’s dive in to our first listener question. This first question is from a longtime listener and a MicroConf attendee. I’m going to keep him anonymous per his request, but I did have a chance to meet him at our most recent event in Croatia. The asker says we are a team of 25. Our order sizes vary from about $100 per year all the way up to $75,000 a year. That’s servicing individuals, teams and departments, but we want to add full enterprises and six figure sales, which for us would be a thousand users and above. Should we be looking to offer them higher service at a higher price per user? So like dedicated account managers, product request priority, et cetera, or a lower price per user and just a small degree of extra service. For example, double the number of training sessions even though they have many times more users. And the question asker referenced a link to a Jason Cohen episode called Adjacency Matrix, how to Expand After product-market fit. And the quote from there is what might not have been obvious is how dramatically different it is to sell to the enterprise. Often startups claim this as their growth plan even when they’re only at 500 k in a RR. Again, this is Jason Cohen speaking in this essay. This is definitely the wrong strategy at that moment. This exercise makes it clear yet companies often conclude the opposite. They should instead be considering simple use cases at larger companies. So they should be ignoring the complexity of large companies so they can continue winning where they are already strong. So Jason Cohen, I like the way he breaks this down is selling to the enterprise can be done in different ways. You can have simple use cases at larger companies and we can call them enterprise usually. I don’t differentiate between those two things on this show, but a simple use case at a large company versus a true enterprise sale where it’s a quarter million dollars, a half a million dollars, the sales lead time is one to two years. Procurement alone takes 3, 4, 5 months. They redline your terms of service. That is different than a simple use case that your selling a lot of your licenses to a very large enterprise. So that’s what the question asker is asking, right? Should they think about getting into these enterprise sales at this point with a team of 25, they already sell up to 75,000 per year. I’m of a couple minds on this one. I’m going to be honest, I hate enterprise sales. And so if you can get away without doing the 6, 12, 18, 24 month sales cycles, I would do that and still grow the business. I would do that. They are nothing but a headache. And enterprise sales is something that a lot of bootstrappers shy away from. They want the self-serve bootstrapper dream, so to speak. But there’s an in between. If you’re selling $75,000 a year contracts right now and you’re not having to deal with all the headaches of true enterprise sales, I think that’s a pretty good business. On the flip side, one could say, well, do you want to maximize for growth or do you want to maximize for how much you enjoy running the company? And I think that’s a question to ask yourself is maximizing for growth would imply you would go wherever the money is, and so you would dig into these extremely complex sales. But the second thing is what do these companies want? We’re thinking about it right now from your perspective as the founder, but how do these companies want to buy? How do they buy today when they buy something else that costs a hundred, $150,000? Do they want higher services at a higher price or do they want a lower price per user and a small degree of extra service? If I were you, I would try to charge a higher price per user to enterprises. It’s not always possible, but that is, we talk about the perfect pricing. Typically it starts at like $50 a month and then it doubles and doubles, so it’s 102 hundred a month, and you have this dual funnel also where you’re selling 10,000 or $50,000 a year. I’m just laying out ideal pricing. If I were to build a company from scratch today, in addition, enterprise would pay a higher price per user, not a lower price, and that’s because they need things like custom terms of service. They need to be able to redline everything. They need to be able to have invoices and pos, which are probably already doing at 75,000 a year. They might need single sign on, which I know has traditionally been an enterprise offering, but has recently almost started drifting down into cheaper tiers. They need a dedicated account manager, as you’ve said, dedicated support SLAs in terms of uptime and support response times. You have product request priority, et cetera. That’s where I would lean towards is your team is at a size of 25 people where I feel like you can support that kind of true enterprise plan. So if I were in your shoes, that’s the direction9I would lean. And then his second question is, for our first product, we were lucky and had time for people to start organically talking about it at professional associations, trade shows, et cetera. But for our second product, it’s ai, so we don’t have as much time. What are your favorite examples of encouraging word of mouth marketing in B2B SaaS? I get this question once a month just from maybe a TinySeed founder or in some type of q and a or conversation. The bottom line is word of mouth is a great marketing channel because it’s free and it happens on its own. And word of mouth is a terrible marketing channel because it happens on its own. And trying to encourage word of mouth marketing is something I have never seen B2B SaaS do well, I’ve never seen a silver bullet is more of what I should say. There are ways to encourage it, and I’m going to run through a few of those here, but there’s no way to control it. You could control your ad spend if you have pay-per-click marketing work, you could control cold outbound. You can control even going to events if that’s working. It’s fairly repeatable. You go to more events, you meet more people, but word of mouth feels like this perpetually elusive marketing approach that so many of us want to encourage. And it’s usually we try a few things and it kind of does, but you never really are in control of it. I don’t know of a single, again, I’m invested in 191 b, two B SaaS companies and I don’t know of a single one that has kind of a silver bullet of like, oh, just do that and it accelerates it. However, with all that said, first I want to define word of mouth marketing. There’s a semi-private Facebook group or a Slack channel or Reddit. These are things I call hangouts. And if you see a question, what is a great source of funding for Bootstrappers? And you might see people weigh in with, oh, check out TinySeed, check out MicroComp, check out Rob, Walling. That is a form of word of mouth because it is people that are not you chiming in on a, it can be public, semi-private, fully private conversation and effectively bringing up or endorsing your product. So that’s one way. There’s another way which is a direct conversation where it’s at an event. I’m having an in-person conversation. Someone says, what’s the best CRM today for B2B SaaS? And I say it depends on what you need, but I really like close.com and we still use Pipedrive and there’s one called Adio and we can kind of talk through, so that’s a similar but different form or even a direct email or a direct text. If a friend texts me and says, Hey, what’s your recommendation today for email marketing automation? And I’d be like, oh, well if you’re SaaS, then it’s user list. And I’ve always liked Active campaign and their beehive if you’re doing X, Y, Z. So I group those into kind of two different things of Direct one-on-one and more like public, semi-public. Then the third is virality. And this is where it’s not really word of mouth, but it’s like slack. There’s two depths of virality in B2B SaaS. You can actually read ’em out in the SaaS playbook, but one is strong virality and that’s like Slack has where, hey, in order to use it, I have to invite someone from my team. So the virality is very strong. It’s a very high viral loop when you have weak virality and B2B SaaS, that’s more like a powered by link. So like Savvy Cal or Sewell, their customers share a link to get someone to sign a document or to get someone to book their calendar. And so that’s weaker. SaaS virality powered by Drip link was another form of weak SaaS virality. It’s still virality, but I separate that from word of mouth, not the same. It’s not someone making a recommendation, it’s just as they’re using the tool, they’re doing it. Alright, so I’ve defined these three types, right? The public word of mouth, the private word of mouth, and virality with strong and weak. So favorite examples of encouraging, let’s say the public word of mouth. I like to monitor forums, Facebook groups, Reddit, podcasts. I used to use Google alerts and I found that Google alerts is, it just doesn’t work anymore. So there’s a couple of tools I use, one’s called F five Bot, the other one’s called sen, S-Y-F-T-E-N. And the third is Arvid calls Pods scan fm. And I use those three tools to monitor any mention of any of my brands. So TinySeed, MicroConf, SaaS, playbook, startups, For, the Rest, Of, Us, my own name, start small, stay small, just whatever you can imagine. I like to sometimes participate in those conversations and sometimes not. But I do like to hear and see how often people are mentioning it and in what context and sometimes I have to jump in and correct someone. They’ll say, oh, TinySeed offers this much for this percentage of a company. And I’m like, no, that’s not what we do. You’ve misunderstood, but thanks for mentioning and I’ll correct it. Other times I’ll just jump in and say thanks a lot for the mention. Really appreciate it. Usually someone will mention, oh, Rob Walling said this in a YouTube video, and then I’ll go out and find the YouTube video and I will link it up because like, Hey, thanks for the mention, here’s the direct link to make it easier for you. So that’s a way of encouraging engagement. It’s a thing that doesn’t scale, but I find that things that don’t scale work better than you might imagine even at later stages. So that’s for the more public interactions. Participating in those conversations. Once you’ve been mentioned to me, it’s fair game. Now I don’t come in posting a bunch of links. Here’s a discount code to the things you mentioned. I genuinely either say thank you, I correct stuff. If I find there’s maybe a misunderstanding or I provide direct links or even additional recommendations like, oh, you recommended that YouTube video. I actually talked about it more in depth in this podcast episode. There’s a transcript if you just want to read through it. Now let’s talk about the more refer a friend word of mouth. I know people who have refer a friend or affiliate programs and refer a friend, you get a month free. They get a month free. That’s fine. That works well with B2C. I find that it works perhaps less well with B2B. I’m not saying you shouldn’t do it, but a lot of B2B folks are just less motivated by a free month of service or by a $50 Amazon gift card. If you have something that you feel like will motivate your people to refer it, then you could certainly do a manual email to all of your customers and just try it. And whether it’s free service, Starbucks gift card, Amazon gift card or something else, you can totally try this. I will also say that with my last SaaS company and I recommend to others do this, is there’s a certain point where customers love your product, certain point in their lifecycle where they love it and they don’t take it for granted. Usually it’s 60 to 90 days, it’s just past that. It’s where your churn plummets it. So you might have 8% churn, 10% in your first month, 6% second month, and then it’s like 1% from then on. And what that shows you is that folks who’ve entered a credit card are using their first paid month as an extended trial. And so I know that if my churn plummets in the third month, probably about day 75 to 90, I want to send an email that’s like, Hey, I’m Rob. I’m the founder of X, Y, Z company. We are a bootstrapped software company and one of the ways that we grow is when folks who love this tool spread the word and to encourage that, I’d like to offer you this X, Y, Z reward. If you haven’t otherwise, just ask it as a favor. I would really appreciate if you are loving our tool, getting a lot of value out of it, if you would forward this email to a couple people who you think could get value out of it. So you just ask for it. Are you going to get a 50% uptake on that? You’re not. Are you going to get more than 0% uptake? You are? So that is something that we did at Drip and it performed to the tune of single digit percentages in terms of people forwarding and signing up. But the nice part is you can put a referral link in that email and then you’re able to track it. Last thing I’ll say with strong virality and weak virality is strong virality. You can’t really just engineer that into a product weak virality. You can’t think about where can I put a powered by link? Where can I put some type of weak viral loop and give that some thought? Again, I don’t consider that word of mouth. Some people just confuse virality and word of mouth. And so that’s really why I spent so much time defining those. So thanks for those questions anonymous. I hope my answers were helpful. My next question is a voicemail and of course audio and video questions do go to the top of the stack as well as later stage questions go to the top of the stack.  Speaker 2:Hey Rob, it’s Flores. Thanks in part to your content, we managed to grow our radio ad platform to about seven KMRR and it’s actually a complete new way of working with radio ads. And we find that when we speak to customers extensively by phone or at events, many of them become customers. But in online marketing for example, the traditional view of radio seems to work against us. How would you approach acquisition if you’re fighting against such a traditional view of your products, which is simply not true anymore? Thanks.  Rob Walling:Talk about a voice for radio. Wow, I’m envious of Flores’s voice. Thanks for the compliment. At the start he said thanks. In part to my content, we managed to grow our radio ad platform at about seven KMRR and that’s really cool. It’s always good to hear. So you’re facing what’s called an education problem. And of course as a bootstrapper, do we want to educate our market or do we want to go to the people who already believe it? We want to go to the people who already believe it. There are the five stages of awareness from Eugene Schwartz and it’s unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware, in a perfect world, you only sell to most aware. The problem is in any given market, there might only be dozens of most aware people in the entire world looking for your solution this month. So you inevitably have to go up that chain to the stage four of product aware or just the problem aware people that are searching for how do I solve this problem? And you see companies like v.io do that really well, especially if that problem is searched for in Google and has high search volume. You can cover things like how do I add transcripts or subtitles to a video or captions or how do I resize a video? Again, if you go to v io and look in their top navigation, you’ll see they have 20, 30 different use cases. All of those are very obviously SEO plays. And so that’s a great way to go after folks who are problem aware but potentially not solution aware. And that of course is where a freemium funnel works really well. So if I’m being honest, my advice is don’t educate the market. Now, is that realistic? I don’t know. Is the market of people who understand the value of traditional radio advertising big enough for you to build a great business? I don’t know. But if you need to educate them, then no one’s searching for this, right? This is not an inbound product. It is truly outbound. And my entire premise would be to fight against that traditional view. So we saw Salesforce do this with their campaign back in the Ts where they said no software, right? The traditional view of CRM software was that. It was like what? PeopleSoft, I don’t even remember what the CRMs were back then, but they were like a million dollar implementation and usually they didn’t work and it was all on-prem and it was a pain in the ass. It was consultants and it took two years and Salesforce said no software, right? They had the circle with the line through it and software in it, and they became the anti software company. Now they are software today. That’s the funny thing is software at that point was considered, it was desktop or installed or on-prem. These days we think of SaaS as software, but there was a differentiation at that point. There was cloud-based software, right? Application service providers. Their whole education plan or their whole education approach was to educate the market and to take a real strong stance. HubSpot did the same thing. They invented this term inbound marketing. I had talked to Dharmesh at one point. He said it took millions of dollars. It might even have been eight figures and several years to kind of define that term. And it’s expensive and it takes a long time. With Drip, we took the same approach, obviously at a much smaller scale because we were bootstrapped, but the headline that I’ve mentioned on this show many times is lightweight marketing automation. That doesn’t suck. So my big thing was marketing automation tools suck. They’re too expensive. The sales process is awful. Don’t use them, use us instead, we’re less expensive. Great ux, we’re not clunky, we’re not buggy. I was basically being very deliberate about going against the things that people hated. And these were all words that customers and potential customers had told us that they didn’t like about the competitors, right? The Infusionsoft, the Marketos, the Pardots. And so that became our entire positioning. That’s probably what I do here is be very opinionated about it and come out swinging in terms of you think traditional radio doesn’t work, this is where you’re wrong. This is not your father’s, it’s the old Oldsmobile ad campaign. This is not your father’s Oldsmobile where they tried to reposition, rebrand. That’s kind of the approach that I would think about and I would probably have a long conversation with Baird or chat GPT around this of how do I develop positioning and branding around this such that as long as I’m being genuine about it, and I’m not exaggerating claims, I’m basically saying, if you are not doing this and you’re this type of business, you are missing out. You are losing out. Stop paying $40 a click on Google when you can do radio ads and get people for a fraction of the price, right? So that’s how I think about it’s be super opinionated, don’t sell from your heels. I’d go in pretty hard. And so all that said, appreciate that question because in a perfect world, you don’t have to educate the market, but sometimes you find that you have to. So I hope my answer was helpful. My next question is from Sean Matthews.  Speaker 3:Hi, Sean Matthews from Left Hook. Currently we are a services company that builds integrations for software companies, bootstrapping our way to trying to build a software product that helps deliver the same thing using and leveraging pretty highly our open source framework called Frig that delivers and developed integrations. So what we’re looking for a question we have as we look at our ideal customer profile, it’s basically B2B SaaS, founders, companies, product people, partnerships. And we are curious as to how, and I haven’t heard you talk about this on the show before, what’s the general census about approaching accelerators, incubators, VCs, portfolio companies, and trying that as a channel to essentially sell your product into? And for us it would be approaching them and saying, Hey, look, we have this open source framework that you can use to build your integrations quickly and easily. And obviously we have some services on the side that we can sell them to do that, and we have a product we want to help manage that process for folks, but the core of the tech is open source and they can run it themselves. So the question is, is that a valid approach? Can we go to VCs? How should we go to VCs and say, Hey, we have this solution that could fit your entire portfolio, you should recommend it. Same thing with accelerators, same thing with incubators. I’m guessing this has been a thing that’s been attempted many times. So is it a frowned upon thing? Do people like it? How would you go about doing that? Obviously I do think having a direct relationship with VCs makes sense if we want to go get funding ourselves. On the flip side, I can imagine it becomes just a no-go. They get bid or sold that all the time. So why would they even talk to us? So curious, your thoughts. You have a more of an inside track than we do, and you probably heard people attempt this before. What’s your thought?  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Sean. Yeah, so there’s a couple approaches you can take here. One approach that you should not take is to scrape the portfolio companies from a website and cold outreach them one at a time because it really pisses people off. We get this about, let’s see, how often does it happen? Once a quarter, once a month within TinySeed. And the founders recognize it very quickly. They post in the private founder SOC channel and they say, is anyone else getting this outreach? And it becomes real obvious real quick. And then oftentimes we will reach out to someone and say, yeah, don’t do this. It’s bad form. You might say, well, it’s just cold outreach. Why wouldn’t I do that? Because it makes people mad because they don’t want to be sold to. That’s not the purpose of why they’re listed on a portfolio page. And it’s especially bad if you are leveraging my name MicroConf Tiny Seeds name and saying like, oh, I worked with another TinySeed company. And then people get in and they’re like, have they worked with anybody? Oh, are they lying? Or if they have, they’re kind of using our brand as if we’re endorsing them in this cold email. It’s a problem. So I would say don’t do that. If you’re going to do it, you want to, I think partner with the VCs, the accelerators, whoever. Now the thing you have to think there is, so what’s in it for them? Because the way you’ve described it, you have a tool and a service that could sell to these companies. So you get a lot out of this. You get sales. What do the portfolio companies or the VCs get out of you selling to them? What special deal, special service, significant noticeable discount. This is where you can think about maybe offering to be part of their perks. Pretty much every accelerator I know has a perks page with free AWS credits and all kinds of stuff. The thing there is it has to be significant. It’s not a 10% discount that doesn’t get you on perks pages. You’re talking 25, 35, 40 5% discount, like something noticeable or free for the first year. Something that really gets people’s attention because everybody wants to be on those perks pages for exactly the reasons you would imagine. But the perks page is probably the most standardized way of thinking about it. Another thing to consider is does the VC R accelerator, do they have anything you can sponsor? Do they throw an event? Do they have a podcast or YouTube channel? Do they have a newsletter? They have anything that takes sponsorships? Because that can be a nice way to get into conversation with them and sponsor it, see how it goes, see the support, and see if there is room down the line for some type of partnership. So thanks for that question, Sean. Hope it was helpful. My next question is about profit sharing.  Speaker 4:Hi Rob. This is Johannes longtime listener and co-founder of leady. We are a SaaS helping marketing agencies onboard their clients by getting them access to their clients’ accounts such as their Facebook page, Instagram, any advertising accounts. In just a few clicks, we have grown lei over the last four years into a profitable business and we would like to share some of these profits with our employees and freelancers. Of course, there are a few questions that we have to answer. For example, what percentage of our profits are we going to give away? Do we differ the compensation for each employee or freelancer by how many days they work for us or even where they’re based? For example, we have people from the Philippines and people from the uk, or do we make a difference also depending on how long they have been with us. We’d love to hear your thoughts on these questions and if you’ve seen any bootstrap companies doing this for their employees and even maybe freelancers without creating too much overhead. So keeping things simple as well. Thanks so much and keep it up.  Rob Walling:I appreciate this question. I get this every so often. In fact, so often that I wrote about it in my book. This has playbook sa playbook.com, quoting from page 138. The nice thing about profit sharing is that it doesn’t require you to sell your business for employees to make money. So in this section, this is a team chapter. I talk about equity, stock options, profit sharing. I even cover bonuses and I say consider structuring profit sharing as a pool rather than a committed percentage to an individual. For example, instead of telling early employees, they get one, two or 3% of profits have all key employees share in a 10 or 15% profit sharing pool. I go on for another few paragraphs. Obviously 10 bucks can get to the PD for the Kindle, or what is it, 12 bucks on Audible for to hear my dulcet tones read it to you. But the best explanation and examination of bootstrap or profit sharing that I know is from Peloni founder and CEO of Balsamic. So if you type in balsamic profit sharing in Google, you will find his article. And essentially they started with a pool of 10% of the profits, and that’s probably where I would start. You can always go up, you kind of don’t want to go down. He distributes it each quarter and at some point years into the company where he felt more comfortable, he increased it to 15, and I believe he’s now at 20% of the profits get distributed quarterly and it is allocated to full-time employees. Only 25% is split equally, and 75% is based on seniority. Then it’s weighed by the cost of living for each employee because they have salaries based on cost of living because they have 29 employees all around the world. And he notes they do quarterly because monthly was too much paperwork and yearly kept some unhappy people around longer than they should have stayed, which I really liked. That is by far the best breakdown. If you go read that full piece. I love the way he does it. I have seen some other bootstrappers write about their profit sharing, and I think some of the advice they give is really bad. So I would, without throwing particular people under the bus, I would look at PE, eagle zoning, balsamic, and I would ignore any other bootstrapper profit sharing that I see because I believe there was someone who was giving away more than 50% of their profits are their employees and that it makes your business, I’ll say almost inviable. It’s just if you ever go to sell, it’s just not a great way to structure a profit sharing. It’s too much. So with that said, it’s a short answer to a question, but hopefully that is helpful. And with that, we will wrap this episode. Thanks so much for joining me this weekend.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I sit down with Derek Reimer as we review the key takeaways from MicroConf Europe 2024, which happened just two or three weeks back in Dubrovnik, Croatia. You’ll hear us discuss in this episode several of the most notable talks, as well as some takeaways that we received from the speakers. In addition, I give an overview of the event and I talk about how it sold out in only seven weeks, and there were many folks who wanted to attend the event that weren’t able to get a ticket. So if you’d like to attend the next MicroConf, it’s going to be in New Orleans next March, you can head to MicroConf dot com slash us to get your ticket. Now, the tickets as of today, are the least expensive they will ever be. They’re only going to get more expensive. And this event, if our past events are any indication, will sell out. So MicroConf dot com slash us if you’re interested in heading to New Orleans in March of 2025. And with that, let’s dive right into my conversation with Derek Rimer. Derek Rimer, thanks for joining me on the show to talk through MicroComp Europe.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, it’s my pleasure to be back. Just sinking back into central time, having left Europe yesterday.  Rob Walling:So you woke up at five 5:00 AM all bright-eyed, Moshi  Derrick Reimer:Tailed. I get glimpses of what it’s like to be a true morning person.  Rob Walling:Indeed. I love flying West. It’s so nice. And then flying east is like, oh no, I need to take gobs of melatonin and still wake up. Actually, the first night I was there because I got two or three hours sleep on the flight to Dubrovnik, and then first night I was there I stayed up just till eight, which is like a victory. I’m so tired. Oh my gosh. So I take melatonin and I figured usually if I can make it to four or five, I’m super happy. So I wake up and it’s all dark outside and I was like, I got to go to the bathroom and I look at my clock, it’s 10:30 PM and I was kind of awake and I was like, no, I just took a nap. I basically, and I was like, I need to take more melatonin now  Derrick Reimer:To  Rob Walling:Get down. So I took again and then I was out till three 30 and I was like, no, that’s not enough. So I hate flying east.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, it’s tough. I don’t have a ton of experience with it. And it’s funny, I was chatting with a R on the opening night and regaling it with my story of the 12 hour layover that I had on my way out to Europe. We came a little bit early to do a little vacation ahead of time, and then he was just laughing at me like, oh, you sweet summer child, you don’t know the tricks. Here’s how  Rob Walling:I would not do that. As someone who’s gone to Europe a bunch. Yeah, you do start to get a little travel hacky with it. I’m the same way. So this was your first time to MicroConf Europe and you’ve been to many of the US events? Almost all of them, if I recall right.  Derrick Reimer:All but the first one because I didn’t know you then. Very first one.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yeah. What a trip. I guess to kick it off, let me give folks an overview of the European event maybe compared to the US event because the US event pre Covid was 300 people and post Covid has been about 2 25, 2 50, and the Europe event is the biggest event we’ve ever done in Europe. This year, I think it was 150 ish, maybe a little more, 155 attendees. And that’s the biggest it’s ever been. We sold it out in seven weeks and that’s been the new thing since covid is obviously there was a huge drop off and then we feel the momentum has come back to the event. So I expect Atlanta sold out, this sold out, and I expect MicroConf New Orleans. This is the announcement. No one’s heard that before. Now. Yeah, aside from, unless you were in dub, brunick, new Orleans, which is going to be next March, I expect that to sell out as well in the next couple months. So 150 ish, 150 to 160 attendees. The room was packed, great energy. There were 30 countries represented and interesting tidbit, we had 30 better half tickets. The guest passes where people can, your spouse or significant other can join you at an evening event. 30 of those, so that’s 20% of the attendees brought a spouse or significant other, which I believe you yourself did.  Derrick Reimer:I did, yeah. And that was really awesome because I feel like I got to meet a lot of people’s plus ones and that gives you a different sense of the person. For sure. When my wife’s with me, she’s hyper social and very good at getting conversations steered towards, I want to meet, I want to talk about you as a person and not just the work, not just the startup you’re working on. Whereas a lot of times for me, a MicroConf conversation will just be like, oh, what are you building? Here’s what I’m building, what are you struggling with? And those are all interesting, but when you start to get a better sense of who the person is, that’s where real connections start to form.  Rob Walling:Yeah, big time. I like that about MicroConf. I don’t know of other events that do it. I’m sure there might be some, but one of the important things that we’ve always emphasized is family, relationships, kids if you have ’em, spouse, if you have one, it’s like this is all part of your life and we’re doing this to better our life, not to make a dent in the universe. We’re doing it because we want our lives to be better and your lives are not better if you torch your relationships. And so that is something I enjoyed about this event was that a lot of folks brought, as you said, significant others, that hotel though. So we Dubrovnik, we’ve done it there four times. We’ve done Europe, micro Europe, I believe 11 or 12 times, and four of them have been in Dubrovnik. So no matter how much I say on this podcast, it’s the Dubrovnik Palace Hotel, I believe it’s called. And I say it is one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever stayed in. The rooms are nice, but the view, every room has a full slider view of the Adriatic. You have a deck and all this stuff. I say it and then people don’t believe me. So when you got there, was it one of the best views you’ve ever had in your entire life out of a hotel?  Derrick Reimer:Oh, hands down. Yeah. I mean that place is just, yeah, it’s all about the scenery and I didn’t fully know what to expect. Having never been to Croatia before, I never been to Dubrovnik of course. But you get there and you just feel like you’re in another land. The landscape is just different than anything I’ve seen in the us. It’s just, it kind of its own thing. And you feel like you’re transported into another world and there’s not a bad sight line to be seen in that place. It’s  Rob Walling:Pretty magical and that’s why we keep coming back to it. And I don’t know, I mean basically I asked the attendees at the end, let us know, do you want to come back here again? Because it is a hotel that it’s hard to get to. I mean for me, for us coming from the US, it’s just a few more hops than I would like. But aside from that, there’s just no drawback to it. It’s such an amazing venue. So with that preamble, I mean I’d like to get into the talks and hear your thoughts and stuff. Talk about the excursions. That’s something we’ve started to do over the past few years as we’ve reshaped and reprogrammed to the event. It used to be nine talks in two days and now it’s like five or six talks, and we fill in the rest of that sometimes with workshops and all the time with excursions where you get out. There was what kayaking this year there was wine tasting, which I believe you did. There was a boat ride to an island and a kind of scavenger hunt. There was some other stuff. I actually don’t remember what all of ’em were. But let’s kick off with excursions. Before we get into the talks, tell us, you picked wine tasting. What was the logic there? And then I guess generally, do you feel like the excursions are a benefit to the event or that you prefer to watch two or three more talks?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think the excursions are definitely a benefit. I remember the first few years of going to MicroConf, just feeling almost I’d been sitting in a classroom all day long, not in a bad way. It’s good information coming from the stage, but sometimes it’s information overload and then you’re trying to fit hallway track type conversations in between the cracks and you’re just completely exhausted at the end of the day if you’re maybe more so if you’re introverted like me and a lot of people in that room are, I think so, yeah, the excursions are nice. We go to lunch and then it’s like, alright, you break after lunch for whatever activity you chose. I chose the wine tasting partially because I figured it would just be a good chill environment to sit around and have kind of those ad hoc conversations with folks. Sometimes I think it’s a little more difficult when there’s a big activity. And for me, I was like, I don’t know if I want to pack hiking boots and whatever else would be necessary for the more rigorous activities. But yeah, so my excursion, I can say we went into Old Town, tried some olive oil and some wine and it was fun. It was fun to just kind of walk around. And honestly, every time I’ve been on one of these excursions, there’s always at least a small bus ride or something and then you sit on the bus next to someone else and you have a conversation there and then it kind of continues or you kind of cycle around a bit as the excursion goes on. And yeah, I think it’s just a good way to put an around the hallway track. I think sometimes just literally standing in a hallway and having these conversations can feel a little bit stilted, so it’s good to have something to do while you’re having those conversations.  Rob Walling:And that’s a good perspective on it. And that’s really why we started. It was like how do we facilitate more relationships in a way that is fun? And we’ve done, there was a hike, right? That was the other one I forgot. But yeah, we’ve done, it’s called beer tasting, what is it? It’s just like a brewery tour is really what we’ve done and we’ve done, gosh, all types of boating and anytime there’s water around, it’s like, Hey, you want a kayak? Hey, you want to get on a boat? So it’s neat to be ax throwing. I think there was a trapeze even here in Minneapolis, Sherry took people to trapeze, which is kind of crazy to think about. But yeah, so those have been fun. And generally we’ve never gotten complaints of like, oh, I wish there were more talks. No one has said that. So that was a change we were going to make in 2020 and then obviously didn’t have the event for a couple years and when we came back we were like, yeah, let’s really do that, kind of change it up. So it has been fun.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Alright. So curious to get your take on what you think, having been to a bunch of us events and not the Europe event, what’s the biggest difference or key differences between the two events?  Derrick Reimer:So yeah, I would say first and foremost, the location is just completely unique compared to, well Las Vegas where the US event used to be. And then even being in more major US cities, it feels like it has a different vibe, maybe a chiller vibe, I would say being in this amazing old city on the Adriatic Sea, and I think that’s a good thing. I think there’s a certain energy that comes from the US events, and I think that’s partially due to the attendee size too. So there’s more people, there’s more connections to make. The rooms are a little bit louder just because more voices. And at the year event it felt reminded me a little bit of MicroConf us maybe six, seven years ago, a little bit earlier stages of the conference where there’s fewer attendees and you can feel like you can make the rounds a little easier through the room. I honestly felt at us, I’ve been coming so long and there’s an increasingly large cohort of people that I’ve just seen over and over again. So it’s like now going to the US events, it’s like, okay, there’s 30 people that I’ve definitely met before and would love to reconnect with, and that’s almost a little daunting. So being a person based in the US going to Europe, there’s a lot fewer people that I’ve met before at the event. So it feels kind of like an open clean slate to go make new connections, which was cool.  Rob Walling:Well, with that, let’s dive into the talks, and we’re not going to talk about every talk obviously, but I like to touch on some key takeaways. I know you astutely took notes because you always take notes, but I was like, Hey, you want our quote a podcast with me after? And I’m sure that’s inspired you to be a little more nerdy on this one. So the event kicked off with KO’s fan favorite Pel Gioni who has done, I don’t even know, man, this is his fourth MicroConf talk. Maybe he’s come to the US a couple times, done some Europe, and he doesn’t really do conference talks anymore, but I emailed him and he’s like, you know what, man, MicroConf, I haven’t done it in a while. I’m going to come out and do it. So I really appreciated it. And his topic was, it was moving from developer to entrepreneur to founder to manager, or I don’t remember the exact details of it, but yeah, why don’t  Derrick Reimer:You maker to founder to entrepreneur,  Rob Walling:Maker to founder, entrepreneur. Yeah, that’s right. So what were, I don’t know, one or more takeaways that you had from oc?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, he came right out of the gate. I feel like this was a very strong first talk to kind of set the stage. I mean, he in my mind is sort of a mainstay of the community. He’s almost at the Basecamp level of he’s been there, he’s been executing and just doing his thing and obviously doing really well as a company. I think he said there millions in a RR 29 employees. And yeah, he’s obviously been kind of maturing in the way he thinks about business and that’s what came out in this talk. So I think a lot of us are kind of absorbed in the Twitter sphere of people who are trying to often reinvent the way they run their business or trying to just come up with all of the solutions from first principles, thinking of their business as a product. So that’s something that Dy talked about right out of the gate was like, this was a big mistake I made early on was thinking about my business as my second product and thinking, you know what, I’m not going to do what the MBAs do and what people go to business school that’s for big companies. I’m a small indie company and I’m just going to do stuff my own way. And I think he has learned over time that often you should just kind of follow the best practices. I mean, management theory is there for a reason. So employees standardized job titles actually because they want something to look reasonable on their resume, should they decide to go work somewhere else and be able to have this transferable experience that’s not just like a happiness engineer or something, but an actual job title. People want to know if they’re getting paid fairly. So what are the salary bands for this role? How do you actually define whether someone fits in a role? So it was very interesting to hear him talk about how he made that progression because I think even if you’re earlier stage, well the earlier you are, the easier it is I think to fall in this trap of now we’re just going to do things differently. We’re just going to come up with our own rule book. So I love to hear this kind of wisdom, this hard earned wisdom from a founder who’s been at it a long time,  Rob Walling:Who’s been at it, and it’s not just the number of employees, but he’s been doing it now 15 years. I believe he launched in oh eight or oh nine. And this is the conclusion that pretty much everybody I know eventually comes to is you think you’re going to invent job titles or not have ’em or be, whenever I hear I’m going to do a completely flat org or a democratic org, I’m always like, Nope, good. There’s two in the world that have survived longer than 10 years doing that. It just, we are makers and we want to do creative things. And I love that analogy he said, of your company’s not your product because your product, you have to make a bunch of judgment calls and you’re making stuff up basically as you go along, but your company, there is standards for that or at least frameworks for it. Now I will say that I’ve never run an entire company of 30 people that’s bigger than any company I’ve run. But even at 30, I don’t know that I would have as much process as he does now. Maybe that would be a mistake on my part. Maybe that’s hubris, but I really don’t like process this. I’m not telling you anything But listeners, I tend to shy away from it. So I need someone who does bring process because even at a 10 person company, you need some process. And we had no process at Drip because I was just like, eh, this is whatever, we’ll just do the things and it worked, but then it was like it wouldn’t have scaled very well. So there’s this balance. I think Pel D has gotten into the frameworks and used them well. I would almost dial it down a little bit from what he’s done, but maybe, hey, maybe at 30 people, that is what you need. And his learnings are the reason I almost wasn’t going to have a big section in the SaaS playbook about job titles and salaries and management and when to hire managers and how management versus leadership, just all that stuff. And the shock of after we got acquired and seeing a bigger 170 person company, how they operate and how differently it was from us. I was like, oh, there are some really helpful things that smart MBAs know. I’ll discount half of what they know. But the other half is actually quite helpful and the hard part is knowing which half do you take.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think there certainly is the risk of overcorrecting on this, especially at different scale. I came away from this thinking like, oh man, I need to be thinking how I could be maybe a little more rigorous about stuff and not just trying to make it up, but I’m also realizing for me, I’m a three person company, so it can still look a lot different. But there’s one kind of overarching principle that he stated that I kind of starred and underlined on my notes. He said, the job of the CEO is to provide clarity, and that takes many different forms. So if you’re talking about a job title or something, it’s like, well, how can you make this as clear as possible so that the employee understands what’s expected of them and you’ve made your expectations clear, you’ve communicated this appropriately. And how do you communicate a product roadmap to your team and how do you communicate to your support people how they ought to respond to feature requests and bug reports and all this stuff? It’s going to look lighter when you’re smaller, but you still ultimately have to provide as much clarity as possible so that no matter how small organization can function well,  Speaker 3:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business. But if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results and longtime listener, Chaz Yun hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his hire quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used Lemon io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups, that’s lemon.io/startups.  Rob Walling:Our next talk was from Andrew Davies, he’s the CMO at Paddle. I assume most people have heard of Paddle and he brought in, it was data-driven approaches to growing your company, right? What were your thoughts on his talk?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think he just sort of brought a little bit of his own story into the talk, talking about his experience from being kind of in the earlier stage startup land to now being the CMO of Paddle of big payment processing company. So he had some various tidbits. One thing that he talked about was the kind of general advice in the MicroConf community is raise your prices, always be raising your prices. And he had some nuanced take on that to say, at least in the current climate, he’s finding in the data that just blunt price increases are not working great. And so it’s better to think a little bit more strategically, maybe especially in this current season, about how to segment your pricing, how to maybe play with packaging or add-ons or some ways to say, people who are getting the most value out of these features, you can put them in a different bucket and charge a higher price, but just blanket raising your prices across the board. He’s seeing some pushback against that in the data of not being super effective. And he also talked about pricing localization as a growth driver. Even just this example of expressing your prices in Euros if someone in Europe is viewing your pricing page. And I thought that was really interesting. It doesn’t necessarily change under the covers, I don’t think how your Stripe checkout flow works, but on your pricing page, if you express it in the localized currency, he has seen a nice conversion rate lift. So I thought that was an interesting one too.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s always neat to have speakers who have a large swath of data and paddle certainly has a lot of subscription and SaaS companies. So I enjoyed Andrew’s talk. One thing I forgot to say at the top when I was kind of giving the overview was this stat about the attendees in the room that I was shocked by. I was so shocked. I asked producer Sonia to verify it, and then I said, can you please show me who responded yes to this? And it’s that 24% of the companies in the room had at least a hundred KMRR.  Derrick Reimer:Wow.  Rob Walling:At least 1.2 24% shock. I was like, nah, I think they misread that. I think they meant a R. And I started looking and I was seeing the guy and I was like, oh no, I know them. I know them, I know them. So really impressive room to be in, to be honest. And there’s a huge swath that are in the mid to high six figures in terms of a R, it’s a side jack, but I just wanted to mention that of the quality level of the accomplishment of the attendees. And that was evident in the conversations. I have no qualms with someone coming who is pre-revenue, and there were, I dunno, 20% of the audience or something was pre-revenue, which is fine. That’s great. Come and learn and hang out. But if all of the audience or 80% of the audience is pre-revenue, the conversations get a little old looking for an idea. But when people have a business and you can either learn from them, you can hear their war stories, you can maybe give ’em advice from your learnings that that’s the fun of being at a MicroConf.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, totally. Yeah, at risk of this sounding, it’s was all positive or something. That is one thing that I noticed about this MicroConf in particular. And there are ones in the past, I think in the us I think you guys experimented pre covid with starter and growth tracks to try to address the issue of people being at different stages. And I think whether it was by happenstance or just the way that the Europe event has grown over time, it did feel like a pretty good spectrum where there were people ahead of me and people behind me. And those are both interesting conversations to have.  Rob Walling:And I like to, in this podcast kind of recap of the event, I like to call out things that went wrong because I don’t want it to be a big puff piece of like, Ooh, wasn’t it great? And everything was great. It was one of the best MicroConf Europes we’ve run. It was in the top two for me personally. And someone asked me, well, what makes it great? And I was like, the attendees, the energy, the vibe, the positivity, and then the talks were all good or better. Usually we do. I mean, usually I spend so much time curating and trying to get, I want everything to be exceptional. That never happens. It just isn’t the way it goes. Even a great speaker has an off talk or an off day, or you’re betting on new speakers and you coach ’em and you do everything you can, but when they get up there, sometimes it doesn’t work. So there’s always some mishaps. There’s often logistical mishaps, sprinklers going off in the middle of a room, or small things like the audio popping or the audio qualities, but the room’s too hot. There’s just all things wifi goes out, there’s all things that can go wrong. And I just kept waiting through the event. I was like, don’t say to producer Sonya, wow, everything’s going right. And I’m so surprised. Don’t say that. Don’t say that because the moment you say that, something’s going to go wrong. But I just kept waiting and then we got to the end and I was like, that was one of the least stressful events I’ve run in a long time. And it was just really a really positive event. So I’m guessing that’s how it felt on your end too, as an attendee, I’m hoping.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah. Yeah, it was honestly kind of hard to find anything to complain about. It was pretty windy down by the ocean, I’ll say that. Good point. Yeah, you guys couldn’t have turned the wind down, but the sun  Rob Walling:Was in my eyes when we were at the evening event. Oh, probably. Here’s one thing that I would do differently is the opening night reception was in a lobby and it was loud and I don’t like loud stuff. So that was probably the one. But I mean, come on. That’s such a rounding error compared to the thing. Totally.  Derrick Reimer:Yep.  Rob Walling:Anyways, yeah, let’s talk about the next talk was actually because we did excursions that afternoon. And then the next talk was Mr. Omar Zen home talking about 10 things he had learned starting and selling Webinar Ninja. What were your thoughts there?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I thought it was interesting to kind of contrast Omar with pedi because I think they’re both successful in their own. Obviously Pel has gone the path of the more traditional organic bootstrapping, keep running your company until maybe you want to retire kind of mode. And Omar was definitely more from the lens of, alright, I set out to build something really valuable and I went after it and I hustled. So he started out the gate saying, I intentionally stayed poor while doing this. And I hear the ways that I kind of structured the sacrifices I was going to make in my life so that it was him and his wife. I think they were both part of the business, how they could make this run at building something really valuable and eventually exiting. And he did exit. So it was kind of cool to see a couple of the speakers having this long arc of like, alright, I started, I built and then I sold and here are the lessons that I have. So he obviously had 10 of them. I won’t go through all of ’em, but he talked about making it personal, having your, why are you doing this? What is your motivation when things get hard? And that was a good reminder. He talked about hiring. He said, hire slowly fire quickly. Which is something that I think is pretty common wisdom at this point, but always helps to hear it. This just keeps getting reinforced over and over again by people who have been in the trenches for a long time. You talked about evolving your product over time, holding loosely to your product. And this is something that a lot of us hold very strong onto our product and we love it and we love what we curated, but sometimes that’s not what the market needs and you have to be willing to adapt. And so it was just fun to hear these hard-earned insights from someone who made it out to the other side and sold his business.  Rob Walling:I really enjoyed his talk. If folks want to see the talks, we do package ’em up and sell them. I believe it’s a hundred or $150 for all the talks. And those obviously get on email list microcomp.com if you want to get notified when those are available. And with that, let’s jump to our next talk, which was Marie Martins from Tally. She’s the co-founder of Tally, and she was on this podcast just, I dunno, two, three months ago talking through her journey, but she told that story with more depth and more details and slides and all that. So what were your takeaways from hers?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I mean, what a fascinating success story. I remember listening to her on the podcast and thinking, wow, how did they do this? So it was fun to hear her talk even more about it. And I still don’t know if I fully understand all of the ingredients of the success that went into why it worked to Tally. For those who don’t know, it’s this Form Builder product competes with Typeform and they’re managing to make freemium work at really good scale. What do they have? 400,000 free users,  Rob Walling:400,000 free users, and they’re building public. So the a RR is what, 1.8 million I believe, and they are fully bootstrapped and it’s just her and her husband and then one support person. So freemium is the driver for them.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, obviously she talked about this on the podcast episode as well, but about their sort of early cold outreach strategy to just hustle and seed the pool of free users. And I’m sure within that got a lot of micro influencers who had audiences or communities they were part of where this could just take hold and spread. She talked about how they latched onto the Notion community in particular. I think their product, she talked about being very aesthetically similar to notion. So people who are in that ecosystem would feel like, oh, this fits naturally with the rest of my tool set. So I think there’s some kind of dynamic there around positioning yourself next to a product that is beloved by a lot of people and feeling like, oh, of course if I use Notion, then of course I’ll just use Tally. And obviously she is a very, very talented marketer, knows how to put her finger on the pulse of what this, at least the initial seed community of people who would latch onto this free product, what these people wanted to see and cause ’em to jump over. So it was inspiring to hear her talk about that. I definitely would love to replicate some of that if I can find ways to do it.  Rob Walling:Easier said than done a lot there. There’s a lot happening that’s going right for them that I have a lot of respect for what they’re doing, but man, making that work is one in a hundred or something, you know what I mean? And I have a lot of respect for her husband who I got to meet Philip Philippe, I believe, pronounces. But everyone just kept saying, that product is so amazing and so simple and so gorgeous, and so this and that. And so I’m like, obviously he’s a damn good dev. Probably a full, he’s a full set. Cause he’s the only dev on it, so that’s cool too, right? It’s like to me, did you look him in the eye and be like, all right, which of us is better, sir? Which of us is a better full stack? That would’ve been a heck of a, I think if the two of hands touched, does the universe implode because it’s like the two amazing full stack devs? Is that how that works?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, yeah. I think he actually does, she mentioned this in her talk, I wasn’t sure what their division of labor was around design. A lot of times there’s a lot of times it’s a backend front end developer and then someone who does design separate. And it sounds like Philippe does a lot of their design work as well. So  Rob Walling:Were you alling him and you’re like, bro, I don’t come from my title. Everyone thinks I’m the best full stack. Don’t even bring it. Yeah. Who’s the full, I don’t know why. I think there’s some has to be some big rival where you both are super chill and super respectful and somehow I want there to be a beef Fist fight in the parking lot. So anyways. Yeah, no thanks. I appreciate your sentiments about her talk. It was great to hear the deeper story because in the podcast we can only cover 30 minutes with no visuals, and she crafted it in a way that I really appreciated. Our next talk was an attendee talk. Actually, we only had one attendee talk this year, and it was Tim Vander Castile who submitted a talk about things he had learned building his business. And I hadn’t heard of Tim. And so Tim gets up and starts talking and I’m kind of like, I’m getting tired. It’s the afternoon. And I’m sitting there zone out a little bit, and he’s like, yeah, and then we got our a RR to 35 million. And I was like, whoa. And they bootstrapped and I was like, that’s a thing. And they said, then we sold four and there was an asterisk. It was like, according to public records, I am under NDA, but I can quote a public thing. Then we sold for $300 million. And I was like, what just happened? How have I not heard of this guy? So I was, that was the second slide. I was like, well, now I’m super interested because I just need to hear this story. So with that intro, what was your takeaway from Tim’s talk?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, what a humble guy to be having those numbers attributed to you. I had a chance to talk to him in passing, and my wife actually sat near him at dinner one night and talked to him a bunch more than I had the opportunity to. And he’s just such a normal guy for having sold your business for allegedly $300 million,  Rob Walling:Allegedly we’re pretty confident it was at least that is that sentiment.  Derrick Reimer:So he had obviously just a 10 minute talk, so three takeaways. But it’s interesting how these sort of dovetailed nicely with both what Omar had touched on and what Pedy had sort of touched on. So he talked about the mistake of being a benevolent dictator for too long early on. You kind of have to control everything that’s happening in your company, but once you start building a team of hopefully people who are smarter than you and better than you at their individual discipline, you start to loosen the grip a little bit and trust your team. So he talked about what he would’ve done differently is empower people earlier and remove himself as a bottleneck more aggressively. And boy do I definitely feel that even with a small team, I think I have the tendency to want to micromanage too much of the business, and even if it’s working on the surface, it’s still, there’s a cost to it. My own mental burden and my own managing my own energy can be tough if you’re trying to stay literally on top of every single detail. So that was helpful to hear. He also talked about not thinking enough about culture, and this is something that Pedi talked about a lot. He talked about kind of defining your values and your mission, which again, those sound like very MBA esque concepts that US Bootstrappers wouldn’t want to spend time on, but I thought pedi talked about the benefits of those in a really pragmatic way. Even if your mission is just to stay alive at an early stage, you should state that and everyone on the team should understand that this is what we’re trying to do. And so the way we operate needs to be in service of that. And so Tim talked about, especially as you get bigger, being more thoughtful about the culture you want to craft, that’s one of the few decisions that you do get to make. And the rest, a lot of other decisions should just kind of fall in line with best practices, but you get to choose your culture. So yeah, those are two of my takeaways from Tim’s talk.  Rob Walling:And the last talk of the event was yours. Truly, I like to talk on the first day to get it over with, and I can’t remember the last time I’ve talked on the second day actually, but due to scheduling and reasons, I talked last and I talked about breaking through the seven SaaS plateaus, and I finally took that doc that I’ve referenced on this podcast where I have three pre-product market fit and seven, wait, did my talk have eight in it? It had eight, that’s right. I added an extra one Because this was the interesting part. Yeah, so I have this document, right with three pre-product market fit plateaus, and I had seven kind of pros once you have strong product-market fit, ways you could plateau. And then those were mostly out of my head and experience and stories and such stories from other founders as well as my own. Then I asked a bunch of TinySeed founders, I have easy access to revenue graphs, so I would look to see where there were plateaus and I was asking founders and an eighth one came up and that’s why I added it. So I guess the title was eight breaking through them. And so I wanted to have, I’ve never presented that material. It’s been sitting in a Google Doc and one reason I never presented, it’s kind of challenging. You can say, well, this is why you plateau because you don’t have enough traffic or leads. So the solution is drive more traffic or leads. It’s not actually that helpful to know. So the talk really was to name a framework or at least have to be able to identify. I’m like, I find that it’s helpful for people for me to say there are only 20 B2B SaaS marketing approaches. That’s it. Otherwise you think there are thousands and it’s just like, no, here’s the list. Pick one. Now, maybe I missed one. Maybe there’s 21, but it’s pretty much all of them. So if I say there are eight, is there a chance there are nine? Yeah. Is there a chance there are 23? No, there’s no chance. I know that. I’m not off by that level of magnitude. So trying to codify and get your around the thing is really the goal there. And then I had a story for I guess six or seven of them, like a real life story with a graph that showed someone breaking through the plateau. All that said, that’s the precursor. Did you have any takeaways from the talk?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think I know that plateaus are top of mind for a lot of people in conversations that I have at honestly, the last couple of micro comps in particular, I just feel like this is something that a lot of people are coming up against or at least or seeing on the horizon. So I think it’s was really good to get some knowledge out there, at least defining the parameters around the types of plateaus and how to think about fixing them. I know for myself, as I’ve kind of seen plateaus coming in my own business, it’s like, okay, I feel like I could probably be working on many different things. So then the challenge becomes, well, how do you narrow your focus? Because obviously, for example, getting more customers through the door will theoretically solve any plateau if you can just get more customers. But that’s not always the most rational thing to do, just to try to increase top of funnel. So I think this is, yeah, it was just some helpful nuance to think about. Okay, if you look at your churn, is your churn too high? Well then, and you kind of compare that against maybe bands for your industry or whatever, or at your price point,  Rob Walling:Like rules of thumb or whatever.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, go to profit. Well, they have a bunch of industry data that you can compare against. And so you can start to use these to hone in and then start thinking about it in a narrower sense of, alright, yes, maybe the answer is get more customers. But also before you try to do that, it’s most rational to think about how to improve retention or how to move out of the churn percentage range that you’re in. I think I’m in a range at a relatively low price point where my churn is higher than I want it to be, and that’s probably just going to be the case because of my price point. So perhaps the solution is think about how do you attract customers who will pay more and that will move you towards a lower churn average, for example. So just some good frameworks I think, to think about this stuff.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I appreciate that. That was part of the reason that I decided to do this talk was I see this on Twitter where someone’s like, I’m plateaued. What should I do? And then there’s all this random advice and it’s like you can’t give advice unless you know the Cause. It’s like trying to prescribe a medication when all you see is a symptom. You’re not treating the actual source the actual cause of it. And that was when I realized, all right, somebody needs to get this info out because the thing that I’m going to ask now on Twitter, I’m plateaued. What should I do? I’m going to say, what’s the cause? Which of these eight is it? And if they say, I don’t know, then I’m going to say, you go figure it out and then come back to us and say plateaued because of this. So probably next there needs to be a diagnosis criteria of like, well, how do you know which of these eight it is? And I can tell because I see a bunch of businesses, I have the rules of thumb in my head if I can look at your churn or your funnel or whatever, but how do we get those codified in a way that is actually helpful? Here’s the other thing, and I said this, the bleak information or the bleak conclusion is most companies that I see that do hit a plateau don’t make it out. And I think the number of the graphs that I looked through, it was like 80 to between 80 and 90%. Once they plateaued, they just haven’t yet made it out. Now maybe they all will, but it’s like, no, it’s kind of brutal. Yeah, I didn’t know that.  Derrick Reimer:I suspect that’s because I think in reality, a lot of the solutions to the plateau involves a pretty significant re-engineering of the business in some way. Whether it’s like tap a new market, add on to the product, or add a second product to your product line to expand your value or going up market, I mean, it’s easy to say and very hard to do because you have to rejigger your go to market strategy and potentially learn new skills or hire new people to do those things. So all this stuff is easier said than done, but it’s helpful to have some foundational frameworks to begin strategizing around it,  Rob Walling:I think. So if you’re listening to this and you regret that you did not go to MicroConf Europe, you should come to MicroConf in New Orleans. microcomp.com/us tickets are now on sale, and they are the cheapest they will ever be. The price will only, it goes up every month or two. So if you’re thinking about going, it’s next March 16th through the 18th, that is 2025 in New Orleans, and I hope to see you there. Do you think I’ll see you there, Derek?  Derrick Reimer:Oh, for sure.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yeah. Have you been in New Orleans yet?  Derrick Reimer:I’ve never been in New Orleans.  Rob Walling:Oh, that’s a good excuse to go down there.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I would be going to MicroConf regardless, most likely. But it’s also a nice little thing to have a new location to check out. That’s an extra incentive.  Rob Walling:It is like going back to Vegas again. It’s like, well, I’m definitely not going for the town.  Derrick Reimer:I’m  Rob Walling:Going for the event. But yeah, we’ve hopped around Atlanta. It was neat to pop in there. It was neat to see Denver. I’ve been there several times. I’ve only been in New Orleans once, so I agree. I’ll do a little sightseeing. I was trying to think of some other places that we could host it that are interesting. Austin, Texas would probably be high on my list, but I think I like the idea of continuing to bounce it around for exactly that reason.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, totally.  Rob Walling:Alright, man. Well, thanks so much for joining me on the show today. Folks want to keep up with you. You are at Derek Reimer on X, Twitter, and of course savvy cal.com if folks want to use the best scheduling link on the internet.  Derrick Reimer:Indeed. Well, thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Thanks so much to Derek for jumping on the mic with me and helping refresh your memory if you went to MicroConf or to drop some new thoughtful takeaways to you in case you miss the event. Obviously, we’re going to have videos available, as I said during the episode, MicroConf dot com if you’re interested in signing up for the mailing list such that you hear about the video package once that’s around.

In this episode, I’m going to be answering later stage questions. I received a ton of good questions on X Twitter a month or so ago when I did a call for them, and I had gotten a little weary of answering the same questions about idea validation and early stage stuff. So these are all folks doing six or seven figures in a RR that have questions ranging from regrets for things you didn’t delegate how to decide to DIY, versus hiring a growth agency, deciding whether a customer type is worth selling to or targeting. And more. Before we dive into the episode, my new course, the SaaS Launchpad, has been live for a few weeks. It has been receiving rave reviews, SaaS launchpad.co. If you want to check it out, it’s for the earliest stage SaaS founders. So if you’re looking for an idea, if you want to vet an idea to validate it, if you want to build a launch list, if you want to build an MVP launch your product, this is the course for you. It is the best course I’ve ever put together and it’s really the first course I’ve built in about 14 years. So you can head to SaaS launchpad.co for full details and to check out the course. And one more thing, MicroConf us 2025 tickets have just gone on sale. Every event we’ve run for the past 18 months, I believe maybe more, has sold out and I expect MicroConf US 2025 to be no different. It’s going to take place in New Orleans, March 16th through the 18th of 2025, and right now our lowest priced tickets are available on sale. They will never be lower priced than they are now. We’ve just wrapped up our Dubrovnik event that one sold out, and again, I expect this New Orleans event to sell out. All the details are at microcomp.com/us. Be sure to check it out soon if you’re interested in joining me. And two, 250 of your best founder friends that you’ve known on Twitter that you’ve met in person that you’ve aspired to meet in New Orleans next March. My first question for today comes from Tobe. He is Tobe builds on X Twitter. His question is, is there anything you regret doing yourself instead of delegating while trying to grow to 10 KMRR? And I’ll do you one better. I won’t just talk about things I regret, but the most common mistakes I see early stage founders making, and these are founders who listen to startups, For, the Rest, Of, Us, these are TinySeed founders, these are MicroComp founders, and there are some pretty common anti-patterns in this early stage of learning how and when to delegate. Now, delegating is a balance, especially in this early stage if you’re bootstrapping, because oftentimes you should delegate or outsource a bunch of things, but you don’t have the money, right? You don’t have the luxury of a funded competitor who can hire a chief of staff on day one or who can hire a staff to do things that you don’t want to do. So there is this balance between your willingness to delegate and the budget you have to do so. But with that said, I think a couple things that I commonly see founders keep doing that they shouldn’t be doing in these early stages are things like bookkeeping or doing your own books in general, doing your own accounting, not hiring a CPA DIYing your own legal. This is one that I did a couple times. I never knock on wood, wound up regretting it, but certainly things that I could easily ever regretted. It had those gone sideways when I downloaded a template for a contract and edited it myself. I think founders who are doing audio video editing in the early days are doing themselves quite a disservice. Audio and video editing are so fulfilling. I dunno if you’ve done it, but it just feels like you’re getting stuff done. You’re doing something with your hands and when you ship it, it’s a better end product. It feels really good to do, but it is a tremendous waste of time because audio and video editors even really good ones are what, 15 to $30 an hour? I mean, obviously more expensive and less expensive, but this is an easy one to outsource. Another one that I see founders doing and kind of making a reason for it is continuing to handle their email and live chat support. Now this one depends because if you’re doing high touch sales with a high ticket product and you’re only doing a few sales now and again, then you probably don’t need a support person. But if you do have a wider funnel, lower touch funnel where you have a lot of volume coming through, email support and live chat support if you offer it are some of the first things that I look to outsource. Now, the reason I hear a lot of founders keep doing it for way too long as well, it’s only 30 minutes a day and I want to be in communication with my customers. This is the way I keep in touch and get their feedback and hear what should develop in the product. Now, both of those are kind of reasonable. However, I will say that with pretty much every product I’ve launched, I have hired part-time support help. Sometimes that part-time support help would swing across multiple products I owned. Sometimes I would just overpay them for the hours they were working to say, look, you get a minimum of 10 hours a week. I know I don’t have 10 hours of support yet, but I’m going to bring you in and you can write KB docs or you can help with onboarding or there’s a ton of other stuff that I can find depending on your skillset I can find for you to do to kind of fill that time. So even if you don’t have a ton of support or it’s sporadic, I’ve always figured out a way around that. So I just don’t believe it as an excuse because it’s never one that I’ve used and I’ve always outsourced support within a few months of taking over or launching an application. The other thing about not being in touch with your customers is that I tend to be known for being in really close contact with my customers. Whether I was running SaaS companies or now MicroConf, TinySeed writing books, I talk with people a lot and putting a support person between me and all the end users did nothing to curb that. It did nothing to dissuade me from talking to and hearing from my customers because my support guy, Andy would say anytime there was new feedback, new input, anything he thought was novel or that I should know, he would either cc me on it or he’d just sign it to me. Once it was resolved, any of the rote tasks or the rote responses that he could just hammer out, he would get back to ’em. He would close. I didn’t need to see over and over that someone wanted to reset their password or someone had a question about pricing. Now, if those questions came in a lot, Andy would then say, Hey, a lot of people having questions about pricing, can we clarify this on this page? So there is a key factor here of hiring someone in that support role who is good and is willing to escalate things to you or at least pass things along that they think are notable. Another thing that I regretted, I remember regretting this in the days of Drip was continuing to handle social media for my products. It’s not that I should have hired it out, I just don’t think I should have done any of it. I really don’t. Social media did so little for us as a SaaS tool. We were not Intercom and HubSpot and Salesforce. We were a tiny bootstrapped product that was growing and social media was nothing but a headache if you want to know the truth. And if it drove five customers in the entire history of the company, I’d be shocked. And so what I would do these days, I would just get off social media. I wouldn’t try to hire someone for it. I wouldn’t use it as a marketing approach. For now, I would focus on blocking and tackling on SEO, on content, on sales, on real inbound marketing, on integration marketing, on attending live events, on going on podcasts, on talking to my customers. There’s so many other things that I would be doing to not waste time because social media is a distraction that masquerades itself as productivity, and people justify it by saying, well, I’m working well, I’m marketing. No, you’re not. You’re not marketing. You’re getting on social media and you’re frankly feeding an addiction that these apps are really good at feeding and they have entire teams engineered to make us feel this way to make us feel productive when it’s actually a distraction. So if I were just starting out today, I would focus on marketing and sales, and I would ignore social media altogether until such a point that it became important. And frankly, there are TinySeed companies doing millions of dollars a year that still have almost no social media presence. So it is not only possible to get there. I would say it is easier to get there if you’re not focused on that distraction. And lastly, the thing that you’re going to have to weigh as a bootstrap founder is the next sentence I’m going to say, which is, I know some devs and I was in this spot where I regretted continuing to write all the code. Now, some devs bootstrapped because they want to write all the code, realize that will probably hamper your growth. But if you’re okay with that, that’s why you’ve bootstrapped. So you can be in charge of this and you can dictate the limits or the constraints that you’re willing to put into your business. But I believe that code is usually a certainty. Code is something you can hire someone to do because that next feature does not have any risk versus marketing. And sales usually have a ton of the risk as well as product like deciding what to build, how to take feedback in, how to find product-market fit, all those things are very risky. Those are things that founders should be focused on. I do know some developer founders who continue to write code well into the millions of a RR and even tens of millions for that matter. But usually, inevitably they do step away from it because they realize at a certain point it’s just not the best use of their time, even though they love doing it. And to cap this off, Tobe didn’t ask this question, but things that I never regretted doing or spending time on and I never regretted keeping under my purview and not outsourcing, we’re talking to customers constantly. We’re designing the product, and I don’t mean visual design, but deciding what to build, how it was going to operate, how are we going to architect this? What’s the API going to be like the real nitty gritty decisions around building the product. And the third is marketing and sales. I don’t know of a seven or eight figure TinySeed founder that has outsourced or delegated their marketing and sales before they hit a few million in a r. Now, a lot of folks may hire ahead of growth or ahead of marketing, but it’s to take over an effort that’s already in play. You’ve heard me talk a lot on this podcast about zero to one and how hard that is as a marketer or as a salesperson and as the founder, I’m a staunch believer that you need to keep that under your own purview until you’ve proven it out and you’ve built it into a process that can be handed off to someone else. So thanks for that question Tobe. I hope it was helpful. My next question is from Miguel Sarena. And Miguel asks, how do you decide to do it yourself versus hire a growth agency to do paid ads, SEO partnerships, et cetera? So this actually piggybacks really well on the last point that I was making is that in general, there are a few roles in a SaaS marketing department, right? There’s marketing strategy, which is deciding, I dunno, what do we try next? What do we do next? Where do we put our efforts? So it’s very strategic thinking. High level. There is marketing implementation, which is where you’re an individual contributor and you are clicking the buttons in the Google AdWords console. You are writing the articles or editing the articles and building links and doing that work of SEO or in terms of partnerships, you are going out and building the relationships yourself and getting all that done. So those are individual contributor roles or folks who are actually boots on the ground. And then the third role really is project management, which is kind of making sure everything gets done and there’s more nuance than this, but fundamentally, that’s how I think about a SaaS marketing department, especially in the early stage. So the question of how do you decide to DIY versus hire a growth agency is that as the founder, I would not try to outsource marketing strategy and frankly, project management, maybe I would hire somebody to do it, but realistically, marketing strategy, deciding what to do in what order, how many resources to put behind it, that’s something that me as the founder, I would want to learn how to do. In the old days when I was truly, truly bootstrapping and had almost no money, I then had to go learn the marketing approaches. So I also was the Google Ads person. I was the person doing SEO, I was the person doing partnerships. That’s what I had to do. Now, if I’d had any funding, I would’ve hired out those individual roles. And so these days, if you have any modicum of money and you can pay someone who really knows Facebook ads or really knows Instagram ads or really knows Google ads or LinkedIn ads or Twitter ads, I like coming up with the strategy and then hiring someone to implement that specific approach. And the reason is is that if you try to learn it and you try LinkedIn ads and they don’t work, you don’t know if you’re not good at them or if they don’t work for your business or your customer type. But if you hire someone who you think is pretty good and you get references and you pay them a couple grand a month for three months and they run ’em and it just doesn’t work, you at least have some modicum of confidence that LinkedIn ads for now probably aren’t the best fit for your business. And so individual contributor marketing roles and sales roles, frankly, like S-D-R-B-D-R stuff are things that I consider hiring out before a million, 2 million, 3 million. And when you’re on a budget, let’s say you’re doing 20 KA month, you don’t have the money to hire an amazing growth marketer, but you might have the ability to hire a freelancer who’s good at SEO or a small micro agency who knows how to do Google ads or LinkedIn ads, or you could hire a part-time biz dev person, which is a head of partnerships to handle those for 10 hours a week of work where they’re focusing on doing that. Now, that still means that you are saddled with the strategy and potentially the project management, but that’s the way that I see it working, trying to outsource marketing strategy when you haven’t gone from zero to one yet. I mean, you’ve heard us talk on this podcast. I’ve talked with Derek Rimer, I’ve talked with Ruben Ga as I’ve talked with Craig Hewitt, I’ve talked endlessly on this podcast solo, and it’s just the pattern that I see. People aren’t able to hire out sales and marketing before they get to a repeatable process. And usually that’s when you’re in seven figures of a RR. So thanks for that question, Miguel. I hope that was helpful. Are you drowning in challenging tech decisions? You should check out today’s sponsor tech stack. Unlike typical staffing agencies, these folks are startup specialists.

It allows you to create scoreboards and leaderboards and often gets used for seasonal sports and corporate events. Revenue growth has been good around five to 10% month over month, but it’s mainly come from one time transactions. My question is how do I build up a healthy subscription business? I used to have a monthly subscription, but MRR peaked just below 10 K, 90% of my subscriptions churned giving one-time use as a reason. Can I fix it? Do I even need to fix it? Hope this question is an interesting one. I like this question because it really does call out the thought that not every business should be a subscription business. And there are some businesses or some apps or tools or utilities that people may only need to do once or once integrate while maybe it’s once a quarter, once a year. And those types of businesses are much more difficult to turn into subscription companies for obvious reasons. So one option is to just not worry about it and to take your 17 KA month. And I guess I said at the beginning of this question that it was 70 KMRR, and that’s not true. He wrote it’s 17 K of monthly revenue. And so I said MRR, because of course I think in SaaS and everything’s MRR, but in this case it is monthly revenue. Take your 17 K and enjoy it and use that to stair step your way up to recurring revenue. That is one option. Another option is to do what a lot of SEO keyword tools have done. When you think about people doing SEO keyword research, if you’re not an agency and you have one website, you often need to do keyword research infrequently. Maybe it’s once a year, maybe it’s once a quarter, maybe it’s once every six months. And so churn in those tools can be high. So what have those tools done? Well, they’ve built in things that you would use on a weekly or monthly basis, rank tracking to see where you rank for the keywords that you’re trying to rank for website quality monitors or the SEO monitoring of your site to say, oh, you have broken links, you’re missing these tags to keep everything up to date and in sync and operating well, any type of thing that someone might want a recurring use out of or that they might want to monitor or use on an ongoing basis is one approach to trying to become a subscription tool when you’re currently a one-time use tool. Another way that I see bigger companies doing this is they say, you can only pay annually and you get a year subscription for X amount of dollars. And that’s really a tactic that you can use for this. Personally, I don’t love it. It just feels a little like Verizon making their pricing impossible to figure out so that you can’t actually price compare between their own plans and the plans of their competitors. But that certainly is one way that people fight churn is to only sell annual subscriptions. And the problem is there’s problems with it, right? Your customers might get a little miffed if there are other options that are one-time use that are cheaper, they’ll go use them. They will often complain, oh, I used it once and then maybe potentially do a chargeback, ask for a refund. There’s a bunch of challenges with that, but it is an option that I wanted to throw out in the spirit of brainstorming and getting all the ideas out there. And I think from a high level, those are probably the three things that I would consider. And probably in your shoes, I would try to make this subscription by building other stuff and seeing if it works. If I had the energy and the excitement and the motivation to do it. And if it doesn’t work, then I would do plan A, which is just leave it as one time and use that to stair step your way up. I don’t know if it’ll work or not. I don’t know if there are other features, other things you can cater to that these folks are trying to do on an ongoing basis. I just don’t understand the business well enough. And if you have absolutely no ideas for how to do that and you’ve asked your customers and they have no ideas for you and you ask your mastermind or a co-founder or an advisor or your spouse or a good friend or this podcast and no one has any ideas, then yeah, there are tools that really just shouldn’t be subscription. And that may be the case. I of course, always like to at least try to invest some elbow grease into it. First, I actually did this with T net invoice back in, I dunno, whatever, 2005 or six where it had peaked. It was a one time sale as well, $300 one time with like 20% maintenance a year, and it had peaked between three and 5,000 a month. And so in any given month it was great. It was making my house payment plus a car payment, which I didn’t have because I had big cash for the car. But you get the idea. It was just a nice side income. As I worked full-time during the day and I really tried to grow that business, I was like, I want to get it to 10 K, 12 KA month so that I can quit my day job. And I spent about a year nights and weekends trying to do that before I realized this is a step one business. Now that term didn’t exist then hadn’t come up with the STA step method. That would be what, seven years later maybe. But in retrospect, it was something that I never regretted putting that time in and trying to grow it. I learned a lot during that time about what worked, what didn’t work. And when I got to the point where I was out of ideas and out of motivation, then I put it on autopilot and autopilot’s not real realize every 18 months Google would slap it. A competitor would come up, something I’d need to update the code. There were all these things that would happen, but as autopilot as you can make it. And then I moved on to my next thing, and that is actually when I built out a portfolio of products. Now with a portfolio of products, never try to grow more than one at a time. You focus on one, you get it to grow, and you get basically that recurring traffic that then builds hopefully recurring revenue and then get it to the point where it’s stable and maybe you autopilot that one too. And so I stacked a bunch of step one businesses to get myself to step two, to buy out my own time, quit the day job, and then I moved on to true recurring revenue with step three. That tends to be my approach is to try things that I think could work that I have the motivation to do and that I think I can learn from whether they work or not, whether they fail or succeed. At least I’ve learned to something from that. So that would tend to be the approach I would take. But you of course can look at your own personality and say, do I want to do that? Do I want to try to make it subscription? Or do I just want to take this amazing revenue that is generating and use it to build that standalone SaaS or true recurring revenue? Thanks for that question, Casper. I hope it was helpful. My next question is from Benjamin Hoy on X Twitter, how do I decide whether a customer type is worth selling to or targeting? I have consumers buying my SaaS, but also schools contacting me and occasionally small businesses. How do I decide whether targeting one or the other is worth it? In my experience, you just have to try. So first of all, there’s a difference between selling to and targeting, selling to if they’re approaching you inbound, what’s the real risk there? The risk is a school approaches you says, we want to buy it. And you say, great, it’s $500 a month or a thousand dollars a month. Make sure that you charge enough, by the way. And if it’s a school actually charge per year. So 6,000, 12,000, 25,000 a year, whatever you’re going to charge, charge enough to make it worthwhile. And you send them this quote and you can read founding sales by Pete Kanji or you can follow Jen Abel, Matt Ock, Stelli fte, some of the sales folks in the SaaS space and learn, Hey, how do I kind of navigate this? And if the school comes back and says, well, we need you to sign a big security checklist or fill out this 30 page doc to close the deal, then depending on what you’ve charged, do you know if you’ve undercharged and you need to turn down the deal, or if you’ve charged what 30 grand a year, then it becomes worth your time to fill out all of that and deal with procurement. So that’s the real danger is that you get into a sales cycle or a sales process and you realize it’s more headache than is worth it. And frankly, it’s going to be hard to know until you try it. The biggest thing though, whether it’s schools or small businesses, is charge enough to make it worthwhile. So charge a little more, especially if you’re resistant to doing it, charge a little more, charge a lot more than you think you need to. And if they say no, what are you out? Nothing. A conversation. And if they say yes, make sure it’s worth it. My dad, who was an electrician for 42 years and became a project manager, used to say, there are no bad jobs. There are only jobs without enough money in them. And what that meant is no matter how grindy a project was, if you had enough profit in that, then it was worth it. Similarly, when you’re selling to schools or businesses or enterprises, there are no bad deals. There are only deals that aren’t worth it. You didn’t charge enough. I will tell you that most small businesses what they have a single decision maker, they’re relatively easy to sell to, but if they’re non-technical, I dunno what your product is, if they’re non-technical, then there can be the onboarding headaches, right? This is customer pain versus competitor pain. And so you get to decide. But if you have consumers buying this, you probably already have that. I can’t imagine selling to a small business, that process is going to be very different than selling to an individual. Schools might be different, although private schools and language schools in that tend to operate like small businesses where they are a for-profit and certain people, managers or whatever have credit cards and they often buy a small business. If you get into public schools, K through 12 universities, the procurement and all that can be an annual seasonal budgetary cycles. There’s several TinySeed companies that deal with this, and it is a bit more of a pain. But for me, if I were trying to decide whether to sell to them, if they’re already approaching me, I would give it a shot a few times and see what it’s like. Targeting them is another question. Targeting them implies you maybe update your positioning, your H one or you at least add some landing pages. You start doing some SEO for the terms they’re searching for. Do you buy ads? You start marketing to these as an additional ICP. Right? Now, your ideal customer persona or ideal customer profile is consumers. Adding schools and small businesses as additional ICPs can be good. It can be good, especially if you can charge more, right? What if you have a personal plan and you have your small business plan and you have your academic plan and whatever. They have different pricing and they have different features, and they have different amounts of the value metric that you’re using if you have one. And that does allow you to segment your users and segment that process. And then maybe schools get a demo, and if they’re a one call close and they pay you enough, it’s worth it. And maybe consumers and small businesses don’t. There can be some benefit to it. Now, the flip side of that is, well, don’t you want to focus on a single ICP? There’s arguments on both sides. I have had businesses where there’s one, and I’ve had businesses where there were three or four drip actually launched with four different ICPs and we actually narrowed over time. So I can see it both ways. And again, in your shoes, I would ask myself, am I interested in potentially making more money and learning more about how to deal with other audiences and other ICPs potentially growing this business, making it a better business? Because certainly consumers are not going to pay as much as schools and small businesses. I’d ask myself, do I want to do that? Do I want to learn it? And my answer of course would be yes, because I like trying new things. I’m a maximizer and I’m someone who likes to learn things. So that’s my take Benjamin. Hope it was helpful.

In this episode, I’m going to talk about the eight levels of platform risk as well as the three factors that contribute to platform risk. And I’m not just going to talk about the traditional, I have a Shopify app, or heaven forbid, your WordPress web host this week, but I’m going to look at platform risk from a sense of any type of reliance on an external platform. So if you use SendGrid to send email, how does that factor in? If you use AWS for your hosting or you use an open source package like WordPress, and honestly, this is a framework I came up with a few months ago and I jotted it down in a Trello board. I keep for a podcast episode topics, and I was just going to pull it out at some point, probably put it in a book, I’m sure talk about it on the podcast. And then the WordPress WP Engine kerfuffle flared up by now, that’s a couple weeks old, but it did remind me that I had this and had never really done a full refinement on it. And so this podcast episode is a way for me to kind of bring that out and talk through my thoughts of platform risk as I see it, especially it’s probably any startup, but realistically, there’s a little bit of a B2B SaaS bent to it, right? Because that’s the 191 investments I’ve made. And so I’ve seen different forms of platform risk blindside companies in different ways, and that is the basis for today’s episode. Before I dive into that, tickets for MicroConf New Orleans are on sale. You can go to MicroConf dot com slash us if you’d like to grab your ticket. The event is being held next March of 2025. Speakers are yet to be announced, and of course, I will be there in New Orleans. And if you want to get together with about 250 of your favorite bootstrapped founder friends, head to MicroConf dot com slash us. The tickets right now are the least expensive they will ever be, and they will go up in price, I don’t know, in a few weeks or a month or whatever. In addition, we are going to sell out. We sold out our Europe event, I believe we sold out at Atlanta last April. So if you want to get a ticket, there is no reason to wait. microcomp.com/us. Let’s dive into platform risk. So I’m going to start with these three factors that contribute or define platform risk. And each of these you might think of on a scale, whether it’s one to 10 or one to a hundred, there can be a small amount of risk for a specific factor or a large amount. So the first one I think of is a replacement. So if you are on a platform, whether that is using SendGrid to send email, whether it is hosting on AWS, whether you built a no-code app in Airtable or Bubble, whether you are a Heroku app or Shopify app, is a replacement available for this platform? And how hard is it to switch? And is the pricing approximately the same? So there are more questions than that, but those are kind of the high level, so it’s replacement. So we might think of, well, what is an easy replacement where it’s available? It’s not that hard to switch and it’s a commodity, so the pricing is the same. Well, that is something like I would say SendGrid postmark, mandrel mail gun. The switching cost is real. It is a thing, but it’s connecting to a new PI. And it depends on how deeply you’re integrated, obviously, but that switching cost is not catastrophic. And pricing in that space of sending email or even SMS, I think of Twilio and the cajillion, SMS APIs out there are a lot of replacements available, so that’s going to be a much easier spot. But what if you are built on Shopify’s API and you’re in the Shopify app store? Is a replacement available? How hard is it to switch? And is it priced the same? Well, the pricing doesn’t necessarily make sense in that context, but is a replacement available? How hard is it to switch? It’s kind of like, no, there really isn’t a replacement. And switching is basically impossible, right? Because if you were just a Shopify app and you’re like, well, they kicked me out of the app store, or they took my API access away, it’s like, well, we can go build a BigCommerce, a Magento, a WooCommerce version, but it’s not the same. It’s not a replacement, and that’s not really switching costs, that’s just building spinning up a whole new product. So the hard to switch is just astronomical. So when we think about replacement from one to 10 or one to a hundred, that takes you from easy to hard, at least in my mind. So the first factor was replacement, second one is customer concentration. And the question here is, are the majority of your customers on this platform, meaning that if you were kicked out or the API access were shut off, or somehow the platform suddenly said, you’re on Twitter’s API, and they say, we need you to pay us $12,000 a month. Now to maintain it are 80%, 90%, even 70, 60% of your customers on this platform in a way that essentially will decimate a huge amount of your revenue. Now, what’s interesting is this is separate from the third factor, which is I’m saying lead flow or customer flow. That’s on an ongoing basis receiving new customers, say from an app store listing or a marketplace listing. And that’s different, it’s related, but it’s different than customer concentration because in theory, I could go build a Twitter client, I could be getting zero lead flow from Twitter, but a hundred percent of my customers could be concentrated on Twitter or on Facebook’s API. Again, if I’m an app that postponed, for example, that helps you post to Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and all those Grant, he’s a TinySeed founder, started Postpone and it was just for Reddit. And so when we funded him, we said, your customer concentration is basically a hundred percent Reddit. We think you should diversify into other platforms. And he was already on board with that. So now he has a little more diversity across the different platforms. Now, great example with Postpone. Does postpone receive any lead flow from being in a Reddit app marketplace? No. So you can have concentration and you can have the risk of that concentration without the lead flow, and you can have the lead flow. I guess in theory, you could have, let’s say I was on four platforms. I was like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Magento, and I had 90% of my customers on Shopify and only 10% across the other three. But let’s say the other three were sending me a lot of leads, I just branched into ’em, and usually this is not the case. Usually actually branching into other platforms is a lot harder than you think. We’ve seen Tiny, I’ve seen TinySeed companies and non TinySeed companies try to do it and it can work, but in the majority of cases I’ve seen it hasn’t worked. So the example there though was to say you could have lead flow in those three smaller non Shopify apps, but not very much customer concentration kind of still early. So these three of is there a replacement, customer concentration and lead flow are the three factors that I think of when I try to rank order these levels of platform risk. So now that I’ve defined these three factors, the contributing factors of platform risk, I want to walk through the eight levels of platform risk, and I will talk through the contributing factors and how they relate to each of them. Interesting data point. As of a week or two ago, I had seven levels of platform risk, and the WordPress WP Engine kerfuffle basically begged the question of, well, let’s say you are built on WordPress, what’s the platform risk of that? And there’s different things. WP Engine uses WordPress and they’re a web host, but what if you had a B2B SaaS company that was built on WordPress as the core, so it was kind of a no-code thing hacked together with plugins. That’s almost a related, but a different question. And so I added that as another layer. The answer of course is always, well, it depends on a lot on the specifics of how you rank these. All of these are valid levels. It’s just comparing being built on WordPress versus being hosted on AWS. I have ordered those in a certain way, and I think in different situations they could be swapped a little bit, but to me, this list is directionally correct and it takes those three factors and applies it to a bunch of different scenarios that I’ll give examples of. So moving from least amount of platform risk, what I consider the least amount up to the most amount of platform risk, basically where you have the most exposure and the most risk of your business being killed. And so I’m going to go one through eight again, where one is the lowest, eight is the highest, the most dangerous level one is almost no platform risk. It is where you own your own server in a cage with redundant power, you run your own SMTP servers to send emails. The platform risk here is any development language you use, right? Plus your internet service. I mean, basically you are not reliant on a host, you’re not reliant on anything to send email. You’re not built in no code. I guess your oh, and your risk there is where are you getting leads from and do you have customer concentration and where are you’re getting leads from? And in this case, I’m assuming there’s just almost none, right? You have this great variety of leads coming from all over the place, and there’s no customer concentration in terms of them being reliant on an external API. So this ones, it’s so unrealistic, I just kind of want to skip by it. None of us are going to do that, right? The second level of platform risk, I think of it as you being reliant on a platform that is a relative commodity and it’s easy to switch away from. Again, relatively easy. I know we could make an argument, I’m going to say SendGrid and Twilio, an SMS provider, email provider, those are commoditized and they are relatively easy to switch. There’s no lead flow, there’s no customer concentration. It truly is just a replacement decision. And one might say, well, SendGrid integration will take you months to migrate away from. Usually that’s not the case. Usually it’s a couple of weeks. I believe we did this with Drip because we went from, we had three or four different email providers that we were using that were APIs that sent emails, and it would take us a matter of weeks to switch, and we were sending hundreds of millions of emails a month. So again, this is why it’s probably the most realistic one that a lot of us are exposed to, and this is where it always bothers me. I’ll be on X Twitter and someone will say, oh, man, you build on Airtable or Bubble and there’s platform risk. And some smart outlet comes in and says, oh, yeah, well, you host on AWS and that’s a platform, and you send emails through SendGrid, and so that’s also a platform, and you have risk too. And it’s like, but they’re not the same. And that’s the point of this list is to have them in order of increasing risk or exposure. And I think being reliant on a commodity, whether it’s hosting or whether it is an API of some sort, I think at the same level as imagine if you have a VPS or you have a Docker container and you’re on commodity hosting somewhere, and you can basically just pull that and spin it up in, I don’t know, half a day, a day, two days, whatever. It’s that relatively low switch in cost and it is commoditized. I think that fits in this category as well. So the third level of platform risk, which is just a little riskier than the one I just is when you’re using these large cloud providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Azure, this is where you still don’t have customer concentration or lead flow, that’s irrelevant. Obviously those are more dangerous. And so those are in the higher levels of platform risk, but moving away from A-W-S-G-C-P, Azure, whoever else, it’s not just spinning up a Docker thing and moving the VPS or whatever. I think the switching costs is significantly more than moving away from an API, like a SendGrid or an SMS because this is the infrastructure where your entire app is, and you start to get reliant on a lot of services. And so this one also has a varying degree. It’s a slider of like, well, if I’m only using an EC2 instance and everything’s there, then maybe low-ish switching costs. But by the time I have auto scaling and I have six different types of servers, I have the front end and the API and I have a database and I have Redis servers and I have sidekick workers, and I am using Amazon’s not proprietary, but they’re more like the Redshift thing, and I’m using a bunch of stuff in Amazon. Switching away from that at that point becomes very, very painful and migrating to another platform. You just, again, that’s why it’s the third level I think a platform is. Now, if it’s such a pain to switch, why do I think the risk is relatively low? Because at least to date, A-W-S-G-C-P and Azure are not, they’re not in the business of being aggressive. They have no motivation to, their business model is selling you stuff for a certain amount of money, and so they want you to be happy. They keep rolling out new stuff, they keep dropping prices. It’s the opposite of, I’ll get to it in a second, but the no-code providers where they keep raising prices and where any of those could go out of business any day, and they’re not profitable. For most part, I think most of the no-code providers have raised a bunch of money and are still not profitable. And that’s where Judgment McCall like A-W-S-G-C-P and Azure, I don’t think are going to be aggressive and make people want to migrate off, unlike other startups that are still in that early, say, monetization or growth phase. So that was the third level, which was medium to higher switching costs. There are replacements available, again, A-W-S-G-C-P, Azure and others, but there’s no lead flow or customer concentration. Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates, and they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results. And longtime listener, Chaz Yun hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his hire quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used lemon.io again, when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. The fourth level of platform risk is the one that I added for the WordPress kerfuffle. And here’s an interesting thing. I have an open source software like WordPress, and so that’s kind of vague as the fourth level. Here’s the thing, there’s no customer concentration, there’s no lead flow. The question is, is there a replacement? Is it easy to switch and is it priced the same? Well, open source software doesn’t have to be free as in price, free as in beer, but most of it is, I think the majority of it is. So price is probably less relevant. The question is how hard is it to switch and is a replacement available? And the further question that begs is, well, how deeply are you integrated? If we look at WP Engine, that is obviously reliant on WordPress. Couldn’t WP Engine just fork the WordPress code? I believe it’s GPL, right? They fork it now, I guess then there’s a whole plugin ecosystem. I don’t know what happened with there. So that’s an, I don’t know. It feels like there’s risk there, but they have options. If you were a SaaS company and you had built your entire SaaS or your, I guess no low-code SaaS or your entire productized service, say around WordPress, and suddenly WordPress changed their licensing or they, I don’t know, broke all the plugins that you use and they just broke your business, what would be the replacement for that? Well, you’d have to go and build it somewhere else, right? You’d have to go build it in no code, have code written, do it manually. I don’t think a replacement in this case, it’s the job to be done. I know Ghost is similar to WordPress, but the job to be done of what you’ve built in WordPress, I don’t know that it translates so well to just another CMS. And so this one’s interesting in that longer term, I have this at four right now, meaning it’s higher risk than say your A-W-S-G-C-P or cloud provider. This would’ve been probably down around two or three before the WP Engine, WordPress kerfuffle, and this is how weird these things are, is that given that WordPress has shown that they are going to be aggressive, not making themselves out to be a friendly platform right now. And so I think that is why for sure I kicked them up in terms of the actual risk, the big question is if you had a business built on WordPress, how hard would it really be to switch? And if oh, in a week or two we could build it in bubble, then this really should probably be down more around SendGrid. The number two right SendGrid SMS providers are where it’s a commodity and it’s easy to switch. That’s more of how I would feel about it. But if your business is a 2 billion business that completely relies on the plugin ecosystem and you’re at the mercy of WordPress than I do think that there is a significant level of platform risk. So level five is high switching cost, but there are replacements and there’s no lead flow or customer concentration. The best examples I can think of here are no code. It’s building on Airtable Bubble. I was putting Stripe in there. I don’t know that Stripe fits or doesn’t. I guess switching from stripe’s kind of a pain. And I guess it depends on are you in their subscription ecosystem as to whether it’s like a medium or a high switch in cost. But in any case, this is where in order to switch, you kind of have to rebuild everything from scratch, right? There is no export your code from any no-code platform I’ve heard of. And if you could, how do you import it into a different platform where it’s all just proprietary tech, right? And this again, is where the argument that some no coders make or just some people make is like everything has platform risk. And it’s like, yeah, but they’re not all the same. It gets worse if you’re a Shopify app, there’s a super aggressive platform that’s worse than all the ones that mentioned so far, and we’ll get to that one in a minute. And so the idea here is that if you’ve built a million dollar business and it’s a bubble app, how long would it take you to completely rebuild that in another platform if bubble 10 x their pricing if bubble went out of business, if Bubble had two weeks of outages and one might say, well, couldn’t AWS 10 X their pricing? Yeah, highly, highly unlikely. I just don’t see it. That’s not been the pattern. But what about AWS going out of business? Highly, highly unlikely. And that’s why I put ’em down at the two level and is AWS going to have a two week outage? Again, highly, highly unlikely. A small no-code startup is more likely to have any of those black swan ish events happen. And that’s why I have them at number five. Coming in at number six, I have all your leads coming from a single marketing channel such as Google. So basically it’s 100% lead flow risk. Now, I’m not including app stores in this like app marketplaces I will get to those are seven and eight, but in this case, I’m thinking of being solely reliant on a single flow of leads. And I think is that a platform risk? I do think there is risk there. There is no replacement usually, right? There’s no direct replacement. If you rank in Google and you get amazing organic search trying to replace that with something else, switching costs is irrelevant. You can’t do it, right? Customer concentration is irrelevant because they’re not reliant on Google once they come through SEO, but your lead flow and your plateauing feasibly, it could kill the business. And here’s what’s interesting is you’ll notice in these eight levels, the lower end ones are all kind of technology and it’s the business factors, it’s the growth and new customers and customer concentration that I’ve put at the six, seven, and eight spot. Those are the ones that are so hard to replace. And I’ve seen several businesses killed. You talk about Google changing their algorithm every what, 3, 6, 9 months and entire affiliate businesses that were doing millions of dollars basically go to zero overnight. So the reason I have this as number six is that if bubble 10 x their pricing or had a big outage, you could rebuild that. And if you’re hosted on AWS or using SendGrid or using WordPress, you can rebuild it. The risks are there, but they’re lower than if you lose Google where there is no replacement and you lose all your organic rankings, it can be existential to the business. The seventh level of platform risk, I’ve put a friendly app ecosystem. So an example of this is Heroku, like Heroku apps in general, thrive. Heroku has not, at least to date, and this could change, but they have not screwed their developers unlike number eight level of platform risk or aggressive platforms. But Heroku is one example. I’m sure there are many, many others. In fact, we have a list of I think 80 SaaS marketplaces and it’s microcomp.com/latest/ SaaS dash marketplaces. We link it up in the show notes, but there’s Salesforce app exchange, Zoho Marketplace, HubSpot app, marketplace, Pipedrive, less Knowing, CRM, Microsoft App Source, slack app directory, on and on and on. There are 80 of ’em. I won’t read them here. And look, here’s the thing, can I name all of the ones that are friendly and all the ones that are aggressive? No, I don’t know enough about them. I would guess that big companies like Salesforce and now Slack because it’s owned by Salesforce are kind of a pain in the ass. And if they’re not yet that they will become that. And I would guess that smaller companies and those that have not yet been acquired by a bigger player, a public company or private equity are going to be likely more friendly. But those are just guidelines. If you think about this, it’s theoretical in a way of like, well, a friendly platform is friendly until it’s not, and that’s really what platform risk is. When we think about the aggressive platforms that I’ll name in level eight, they all were friendly at one point. And so that really is the scary part of being built on in that marketplace and why being in a marketplace holds the seventh and eighth spot in terms of platform risk. And the eighth and final level of platform risk is of course an aggressive platform. This is where there is no replacement. You basically have a hundred percent customer concentration. You have a hundred percent of your lead flow from this platform, and the platform is not developer friendly. So this is Shopify, Twitter, Facebook, I’m sure there are more that I could pontificate about. I’m naming these because they have completely decimated companies that we’ve heard about or that I’ve invested in. You hear Jordan Gaal talk about Shopify coming after Cart Hook, and that’s not the first nor the last time that Shopify will do that. We heard Twitter jerk around anyone using their API once Elon Musk bought it, and I think they did this. Didn’t they do this about eight or 10 years ago with Twitter clients? I actually don’t remember, but they did something big back then. Facebook, do you remember? I think it was Zynga, right? It was doing tens of millions of dollars on the Facebook app marketplace, and Facebook just pulled the rug out from under room because they don’t give a shit about their developers. I mean, they’ve been pretty obvious about that. They care about Facebook and no one else. And so there are other aggressive platforms. Again, I do not have an exhaustive list. I just don’t have experience with all of the 80 platforms that we’ve listed at that MicroConf link I said earlier. And so this is where there’s just an existential risk if that you have a Shopify app that’s doing millions of dollars a year and they come and knocking, you’re getting all your leads from them, your customers are concentrated on their platform, and there just literally is no replacement. There’s nowhere to switch. Again, we can say, oh, we could go to BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and these other things, but it’s not the same. That’s starting a brand new business. And that risk that we’ve seen play out many times, and that’s why these app marketplaces are number eight in my list of eight levels of platform risk. Hope you enjoyed this episode. I think the list is directionally correct, and I could see either there being another one added if someone were to email in question that started For the Rest Of Us dot com, or you hit me up on X Twitter at Rob Walling, I think there might be another one that I’ve maybe not thinking about, or I could see them gently reordering. There is a little bit of an, it depends, right? I said it’s like if you’re built completely under WordPress and completely in it, it depends on is your switching costs low, medium, or high to rebuild it somewhere else? That could move that one up or down by one, but it’s not going to move it to three slots. It’s not going to suddenly become as bad as having a Shopify app where they are just known to be really aggressive with it. So that’s what I mean when I say I think the factors are in line, and I think the list is pretty tight. And again, directional correctness such that next time someone on X Twitter says everyone has platform risk, you can chime in with, well, there’s different levels of it, and here are eight of them. This podcast episode, they’ll obviously be listed out in the show notes, and I’m certainly going to be referring back to this in the future, probably included in a book or course at some point. I do think it’s helpful for us all to have a paradigm in a framework around it. So thanks so much for listening this week and every week. It’s great to have you here.

I’m Rob Walling and this week I talk with Ian Lansman, the founder of HelpSpot. Ian has been bootstrapping for almost 20 years and he started with on-Prem software and then after about 10 years launched a SaaS version. Ian and I have known each other almost that same 20 years from back in the days of Jolen software’s business of software forums. And over the years, Ian has started a few of his own podcasts as well as spoken at MicroConf. I believe I were to guess it was probably around 2014 or 15. So it’s a great conversation because Ian and I have history. I think we were able to pull out some really interesting bits about why he’s bootstrapped for 20 years, why he hasn’t sold and moved on to his next act, how he thinks AI is going to impact the customer service and support space. And if you stick around until the end, you’ll get to hear the company name that is most often confused with HelpSpot and it wasn’t the one that I thought. So with that, let’s dive into our conversation. Lansman, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me on. It’s great to be here. Cannot believe you have not been on this show. No, you’re like OG Bootstrapper.  Ian Landsman:Somebody on Twitter reached out and said, I should come on here. And I was like, man, I think I’ve been on there. And then I searched and I was like, man, I haven’t been on there. Wow, that’s crazy.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I am glad you reached out. I think someone, your podcast co-host maybe mentioned it on a podcast and I use arvid calls pod scan, and so my name popped up and I went and I’m like, wait, what? Someone wants to go out and start. So I was like, yeah, dude. And I thought the same thing. I was like, I think Ian’s been on it, but to give people context, like 20 year, I mean really early man back in the day, remember how it was, there’s going to be a lot of jokes about how back in the day, there was no customer development, there was no AWS, there was no SaaS right? Where  Ian Landsman:Before all that, man, it’s hard to believe we’ve become the old timers. How did that happen?  Rob Walling:Oh yeah, big time. Just so people know, you’re the founder of HelpSpot. It’s at helpspot.com, it your H one is your customer service at scale Amplify your support with HelpSpot, the streamlined solution for scaling customer service effectively. So it’s email ticketing, reporting and metrics knowledge base. And since you started so long ago, you were on-Prem for years and then you launched a SaaS. So you have both on-Prem and SaaS, and I think most folks listening know what on-Prem is, but it’s where they actually download your code, your source code, PHP, Laravel, and they will install it on their own server. And then I guess what’s the benefit? Why would today, I would just do the SaaS personally, but the people who still use on-Prem today, why do they do that rather than pay you for the  Ian Landsman:SaaS? Yeah, so definitely the majority or SaaS using the SaaS version these days, but we still have new customers in the on-prem and basically there’s some advantages. Big companies or certain specialized companies like in finance, healthcare, they have different rules, potentially laws. They’re also the type of companies that still have IT departments. And so they want to be in control of their own data is usually the main reason in terms of they control the database and they’re backing it up and those things, but also sometimes they’re just running completely off the internet. It’s like, here’s our help desk, it’s for maybe IT in that case and it’s literally not connected to the internet. And so it’s just fully encapsulated in their network behind their firewall. And so they want to do that. And it is an area I think people have abandoned completely that maybe shouldn’t be totally abandoned because there are some, you could charge more. We actually charge the same price currently, but I think there’s a lot of opportunities there to charge a lot more for the people who want it on premise and things like that. So yeah, it’s not that bad if you have a modern SaaS app, it’s not impossible to make an on-premise version. Some things like if you depend on 30 services, that’s going to be hard, but with a little bit of forethought, it’s really not that bad.  Rob Walling:We have a few TinySeed companies and I don’t know how many exactly, but when they apply they’ll often say, so we’re SaaS, but we also do on-prem. Is that going to be a deal breaker? And I was like, no, we funded a handful. And again, I don’t know if it’s five or if it’s 10 out of one 70, but there are especially like you said in finance or in certain regulated industries where you really do need or want control of that data and just went on some random spot.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, it also gives you some advantages of you’re a tiny bootstrap company, you’re not going to be able to be SOC two compliant, for example, and there’s going to be these type of companies that are like, well, you’re SOC two. Let me talk to your security people, all this stuff. And it’s just like you, it’s you and a couple of people, and so this gives you some outs with those big companies. It’s like, Hey, you know what? You can install in your own SOC two data center and you’re already SOC two and you can, it’s all good and so we’ll charge you for that and everything. And those tend to be also some of the best customers. I mean those are the customers that stay with you for a decade. You’re in there, you’re on a server, just not even the type of companies that are in the mindset of like, oh, somebody launched a new fancier version of this tool we use. Let’s go out and find the fancy. Let’s take a look at this and let’s see if we could switch over. It’s like they’re not, the culture in these companies is not like that, which is great for you as the bootstrapper who isn’t always moving as fast as a VC back company can or some big company that enters your territory. It’s like you got a lot of customers that are just there and they’re happy with your product and they’re not looking around for other solutions.  Rob Walling:And I want to be clear, I want to get back to on-prem probably halfway through the interview, what we’re not saying is once.com, right? It’s not you pay once and that’s a different thing. I guess it’s related, but to circle back to where I wanted to start is where is the business at today?  Ian Landsman:So we’re profitable doing well, a little under 2 million A RR five employees, I think five, yeah, five full-time employees and a couple of part-time people. So it’s kind of been running, it’s just going, it goes up a few percent every year and it’s fine and we’re profitable and it’s great, and I’ve been running it in sort of that not people say lifestyle, I wouldn’t know if I’d go all the way to lap, but that applies a certain ease of life that I don’t know if I’m all the way achieved. But yeah, not super stressed about that stuff. It’s been nice, especially the last, I think we’re going to talk about the early years. There’s probably more action in some ways, but it’s kind of the last 10 years, my kids have been getting bigger. My oldest just went to college, so it’s sort of been this, I’ve been cool with it being profitable and running well and that’s great. And yeah, I think I’m starting to turn a little corner of some new things I want to do with it as I get more time, kids get older, all that stuff. But yeah, it’s doing well.  Rob Walling:This is going to sound like a negative pejorative question, but it’s like how have you not gotten bored? I would get bored. Where 19. It’s next year, 20 years, And we all have different personalities and I’m the person who’s never worked the same job even, let’s see, I think MicroConf, well, MicroConf doesn’t totally count, but even for me it was a hobby for many years. But MicroConf and TinySeed now I think are the thing I’ve worked on the longest six years because even Drip from the founding to selling was three and a half years, and then I stayed another two years, so even Drip was five and a half years. So you could tell I just had that personality of like, Ooh, I need to do the next thing. But you’ve stuck with something for 20 years.  Ian Landsman:I don’t know. I guess I wouldn’t have thought it would be exactly like that in the beginning necessarily. I think what I’ve done is since it’s been profitable, it’s given me flexibility to do other things along the way. So I ran conferences both in world and online. So similar to what you’ve done with MicroConf as a way to explore things. We built a job board for the Laravel and we run the official job board. I built a product called Thermostat that didn’t really work, and I recently sold off. I built another product that I sold off that didn’t work. So every three or four years I get into something else and that’ll distract me for a little while, probably to HubSpot’s detriment, but also probably practically just something that needed to happen to keep me when I come back to HubSpot after my little excursions, it’s like, oh, it’s still here. It’s still doing great. Energized to take on some new stuff and do some new things. And so that’s kind of how I’ve done it. And I think it’s something I’m sure you hear a lot and Bootstrapper sort of problems let’s say, is that you get to a certain level of success and it’s just a little bit of a weird zone where it’s not big enough to sell for the amount of money that’s just like, oh, I’d never have to work again, money, I’m totally set. Don’t worry about it. It’s not quite big enough for that really. Maybe if I sold in 2021 right at the top there. So it’s never been really that. I’ve never had any really appealing offers that’s like, oh yeah, I should sell it. Obviously you could just sell it to sell it and move on to the next thing and still have a nice amount of money, but it’s like, ah, who knows if the second product’s good? I’ve never built a really good second product. I mean, some of these things have been okay, but it’s hard to build a second product, so it’s like, ah, I got the first product that’s done so well. I’m just going to stick with that. That makes  Rob Walling:Sense. Let’s go back to the beginning. So you launched it in 2005 and you told me that you quit your day job and coded for six months, which is exactly what we tell people not to do today, right? Don’t quit your day job and live off savings or you said your wife was basically supporting you during that time, but what a gamble To me, it’s terrifying to do that, right? Were you scared at all and why do you think it actually worked? What was that time?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, it was, man, it’s so wild to think about now. The world was just incredibly different. In 2004, it started, I wasn’t even a programmer in college or anything. I learned the program on my own and then I was like, okay, I want to do a product. We went through a million product ideas, whatever, finally came on this HubSpot idea because I used a really awful help desk at work that was mainframe based and didn’t accept email and all this stuff. That’s where the world was back then. Just to set the stage, A lot of big companies just used had no help desk or a very poor help desk solution. So it was like, okay, I want to do this. Both me and my wife agreed it’s a good idea. So we had just bought this condo, which was a little bit pricey. I was a little nerve wracking. We sold my car, so we had that money, put it in the bank, so we just went down to the one car. My wife kept working, and then, yeah, it’s like I would never give anybody this advice now, but it’s just such a different world because it’s like there was no choice, there was no real frameworks, there’s no Ruby on Rails, no Laravel, none of these things. And so it’s like, okay, I know PHP, I’m just going to have to write it. I don’t even know JavaScript. So I’m literally sitting there with the JavaScript Bible, which is a four inch thick book, learning JavaScript while I’m building the app. And yeah, it’s like I always say I could build V one of HelpSpot today probably in three weeks or something with if I just use all the modern tools and everything we have and just do the very basic version that it was in version one. It’s like, yeah, you could do it, keep your job, do it on the side, all that stuff. But it just would literally never happen. I mean, I worked six days a week, 12 hours a day for six months, and even then it wasn’t great. It was just functional. And so that’s just what you had to do back then, or it wasn’t going to happen. Those were the options  Rob Walling:When back when people would raise half a million dollars with just an idea that really doesn’t happen anymore. But you had to do it because as you said, you had to write every line of code and there were really no libraries, and it was, yeah, it was a lot more to be done.  Ian Landsman:Even the raising money is something I thought about, but you got to remember in 2004, the dotcom bust just a couple of years before that, the whole VC world was kind of a mess. They weren’t looking to fund individual guys with an idea too much. I’m sure there was some investments, but it wasn’t very common. So we were all, you were there, we were all in these bootstrap circles, Joel on software forum and all kind of just working together to figure out how do we ship software without really any big funding.  Rob Walling:That was the thing is the narrative was still raise a bunch of money, but there was Joel and there was, well, it was you  Ian Landsman:Eric Sink and  Rob Walling:Eric Sink and the  Ian Landsman:Wedding Patty 11 was there, Patty  Rob Walling:11, and, and that we all knew each other by name, and it was like, oh, yeah, and we’re all trying to figure it out on our own, but also together of like, is this even possible to do? There was no narrative, there were no books on this topic. There were no podcasts. You just, it was forums, right? I mean, that’s what I remember.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, just forums. That’s it. There was not much else. Those of us in the community had blogs or whatever, and we talked about it, we talked about in the forums, but yeah, no Twitter, right? No YouTube, nothing. There was not a lot of nice ways to get information about how people do it and different strategies and all that stuff. Joel was writing some books. Eric Sink wrote some awesome books. That was kind of it.  Rob Walling:And I remember around that time, I think I had gotten an invoice in oh five or oh six, and I didn’t know, I was like, well, how do you market do SEO AdWords, whatever? So I would go look at, there were no books about startups doing this. It was all the info marketer internet marketing stuff. And so I went and learned copywriting from them and applied it to startups, and I was like, oh, they split tests info. A lot of ’em were very scammy info internet marketers course. So I would take that and then translate it to me, which was the not scammy version. So they were doing split testing, they were doing AdWords, they were doing SEO O, and I learned from those folks and translated it in, and no one was really talking about that in the startup space. It was like startups were raise a bunch of money, go viral and have a big launch party, buy billboards. It was this really odd thing of, it was a weird  Ian Landsman:Time,  Rob Walling:It really was. But folks like you starting HubSpot, you needed nuts and bolts. How do I get in front of people? How do I sell so that I can have a paycheck next week? Let’s flash forward six months. So you spend six months building, you get to launch day. How do you get the word out?  Ian Landsman:Man, it is crazy. You’re going to appreciate this being an email newsletter kind of guy. So I built a list, an email list of, and this was really basically just people from the Joel Software forum and a few people follow my blog, and it was literally like 84 people right now. People launch are like, oh man, I only have a thousand people on the list. What are we going to do? 84 people? And the first month we had $4,000 in sales, and it’s like some people brought it into their companies and brought it to their boss and whatever. And I had started on the SEOA little bit before launch two with the landing page and stuff and help desk software in terms of web-based help desk software was new. So we were first or second for the term help desk software for several years, just kind of like Blue Ocean or whatever, and that was our main marketing channel. But yeah, the initial launch was this 80 person email list. Then the SEO kind of picked up over those first few months, and then that was, it just started going, and we still have a lot of those customers today, but that was the kickoff.  Rob Walling:So someone listening to this who has tried to launch and failed thinks you got $4,000 of sales in your first month, what a month. I do want to remind them it’s not 4,000 of MRR.  Ian Landsman:No,  Rob Walling:It is 4,000 effectively one time. Did you have a maintenance fee each year or how did that work?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so that’s a great point to nobody out there listings even going to think of it that way. Yes, it is not 4,000 MRR and you’re like, woo, baby. We’re launched and going, yes, it was $4,000. There was a owned license. So you buy the license and you own it, and then yearly there’s a support maintenance fee where you pay that and you get updates and you get support. And so if you don’t pay that, you don’t get updates and you don’t get support. So the good thing though is that it was effectively a recurring revenue, and this is all annual, so it was 4,000. It was like a 30 something, 30%, let’s say was the support fee. So it would be whatever it is, like 1500 bucks or whatever a year after that. So each year, that first group of $4,000 would pay us $1,500 to maintain support and updates. It’s a B2B app and it’s a heavy use B2B app where it’s not just like we use it once in a while. It’s like, no, you’re paying people full salaries to sit in this app 40 hours a week and use it. And so generally most companies are going to pay that support, and they did. And so that worked out good long term. But yeah, absolutely. It wasn’t like, oh man, this is monthly. Four grand a month was definitely not that.  Rob Walling:Do you remember what your pricing was? I’m just trying to get an idea of how many copies sold to get four grand?  Ian Landsman:Oh, geez. I think it was one 50 a license,  Rob Walling:So it would’ve been like 30, well, not quite 30, like 26 or 27, somewhere in there. Licenses.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, something like that. That’s pretty good. Sounds right.  Rob Walling:That’s not bad at all.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, I was happy. I was like, whoa. And then we mined that mailing list and so the second month was like a thousand dollars or something crazy, and it was a little nerve wracking there, and then it went up after that and just kept going. It’s an ASCO,  Rob Walling:It sounds like.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, exactly.  Rob Walling:Because the thing that you don’t remember, if you haven’t run a onetime sale business, the sales numbers are a lot higher. T net invoice was my first product and it was 300. Well, it was a hundred when I bought it. I acquired it and then I raised it to 300 and I would sell seven to 10 copies, sometimes up to 13 copies or whatever. So you’re talking like two, three, 4,000 a month. And we did have 20% maintenance, but it really was one time. And so if we lost our SEO rankings or during the financial crisis, we would lose 80% of our revenue overnight. So we’d go from three grand down to 500 because nothing was recurring. So you basically front load it, right? It’s like they’re paying for a year is, which is actually good when you’re bootstrapping, so you get a lot more cash upfront,  Ian Landsman:Keeps you in business.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s pretty nice.  Ian Landsman:Yeah. Well, I think that’s too, with the invoicing software, it’s like it’s a little more like, Hey, we use it, it works. Well, maybe with some of us sometime we’ll pay him his renewal, but we don’t really care that much. It’s operational. It’s like if you can get to that next layer of like, no, we have $2 million in payroll using this software, and now we’re taking this big risk. If we’re down for a day, it’s a big problem and we’re losing money and more directly. And so I think when you’re thinking about the kind of business to get into, there are advantages to that kind of thing where it’s a product that people use very heavily, very competitive nowadays too.  Rob Walling:So you had this on-prem software from oh five until you told me 2015 is when you launched a SaaS version. And the question that popped up in my mind around that is 2015 feels late to launch. SaaS SA first became kind of in the zeitgeist in the, I would say oh seven to oh nine, that MailChimp became a thing. And there was other, I mean certainly there was SaaS before that, but it wasn’t called that. Remember ASPs and whatever the other acronyms, Basecamp, Basecamp, Salesforce, constant Contact, they were around. Even AWeber was really early, but I remember by 20 11, 20 12 SaaS, that was a thing. It was like going, so I would think you having this on-prem would have moved to SaaS, not moved, but just deployed a subscription version earlier. So what was the delay? And I’m not acting like you launched it late, but it’s just in my head. Yeah, that number. So what took that time?  Ian Landsman:I think it was really a couple different things. Definitely when I launched, I knew about SaaS and made the decision to not make it SaaS because I didn’t know anything about running servers. There was no money to hire somebody else to run servers. And so I just feel like that wouldn’t have ultimately worked out very well. So it was on premise and then it was kind going along and it was busy and it was fine. And the big, obviously when I took more notice in terms of direct competition was you had Zendesk, which I think was maybe 2008 ish, something in there, and it’s like, oh, okay, this is really becoming a thing now, so I should probably start thinking about more. But we did even before Zendesk earlier on, have a partnership with a hosting company and they ran the hosted version of HubSpot for people. And so it was a separate relationship with them. It’s like you came to us, you bought the licenses, you went to them, you paid the monthly hosting fee, but they would actually install help spat and run it for you, and if there was a problem with the server, they’d fix it. So we had this sort of in-between, so that did let us delay. Then another sort of aspect to it is that HubSpot was not in any way conceived as a SaaS, so the data structures are not correct for SaaS and things like that. And so in that earlier phase of the SaaS rise, I think it would’ve been pretty tricky to do it. And what kind of happened later on is we had, then you have AWS, you have really cheap servers and things like that, and so it made it simpler for us to make the move because how HubSpot SaaS version runs is actually everybody gets a tiny AWS like nano server and everybody’s on their own server. We do have a centralized big RDS database with multi failover and all that stuff, but we basically deploy it as your own little HubSpot server, and so we don’t have to make the database work for multi-tenant and all these things, and the cost is outrageous. By that point, it was like, okay, two bucks a month you can have a little mini server on AWS. And so that’s the way we rolled it out, and this way we can keep the code base the same for on-premise and cloud and as we go, I think it’s going to start to, we do already make a lot more accommodations for the cloud version since it’s more of the new customers, but that was kind of the transformation there basically.  Rob Walling:How painful was that  Ian Landsman:To go on  Rob Walling:Premises? Oh, it’s painful. Was it brutal?  Ian Landsman:Brutal. Very painful. I mean, because there’s a lot involved had to switch. We moved to subscription pricing at that time, but I didn’t want to force everybody’s subscription pricing. And so it’s like if you want to be on the cloud version, you have to move to subscription. So even on-premise customers, now if you’re a new on-premise customer, you’re on subscription. Everybody’s on subscription and it is annual subscription, which is another thing I think founders don’t think enough about is just only having, I’ve only ever had annual, and I think it’s served me pretty well. We are going to experiment with the monthly option here, but again, if you’re in the kind of business where it’s often, it’s literally a committee we’re dealing with and they’re evaluating multiple choices and they’re not really going to switch off on a whim after three months, they’re making a commitment on their end, so not that big a deal. So that was kind of a big one. The subscriptions, the tech. Yeah, it was, oh, the other thing is moving people. So we have all these existing customers and they want to move, and it’s a big app. We have customers at 70 gigabyte databases, and so moving them onto the cloud is quite a production. We also allow a lot of customization. It’s kind of one HubSpot’s differentiators from other solutions. There’s a lot of knobs and dials and things you can do. You can even write your own PHP in certain spots if you want to do something very custom, which is something that other help desk software won’t let you customize on that deeper level, obviously, because no way for them to really safely do that. So we still to today, so we did that 10 years ago. Today we still will have at least usually one a month, but sometimes more of customers coming from on-premise to our cloud solution. And yeah, it’s a multi-week operation usually to not pure time, not like 80 hours, but going back and forth and figuring it all out and they check it and blah, blah. So yeah, it’s a big process.  Rob Walling:I was going to ask if you still offer on-Prem or if at a certain point, obviously if you sell, have a bunch of customers using it, paying you, you would let them keep going, but the idea of just going to hubspot.com and the only thing you can sign up for is the SaaS. You haven’t done that. You still offer both. What’s the thinking there?  Ian Landsman:And we have had competitors. I think Kyoko was also an on-premise like us, and then they moved to SaaS and then they said, that’s it. No more on-premise. Spiceworks also said no more. So people definitely abandon the on-premise. But yeah, for us, I just feel like we definitely obviously have a good amount of customers who still use it. Like I said earlier, those are some of our biggest, best customers. Been with us 14 years and pay us $20,000 a year, big accounts for us. And so definitely eliminating that would be tricky if I’m forcing them to come up to my cloud or go elsewhere, some percentage are obviously going to go elsewhere just naturally, so I don’t want to do that. I could, of course, like you said, just going forward, but again, it’s like a lot of really great customers are in the on-premise. So even though it’s only probably 10% of our new business, it’s a valuable 10%. And also I think we haven’t done a great job marketing it recently, and that’s something I want to actually do better and try to get that actually up a little bit. There are interesting trade-offs with on-premise in that it’s more support for sure. There’s just server issues and sometimes the support person takes half a day on somebody else’s problem ultimately that we end up being responsible for helping them, things like that. But again, they’re oftentimes much more higher revenue than the day in day out customer. And they also, there’s other little interesting things like they often pay by check or transfer, which costs either nothing or $10 versus cloud customers that often pay by credit card and costs 5% ultimately and stuff, which when on $10,000, 5% is a lot of money. So there are these little other things too. But yeah, that’s kind of the reasons I still think that there’s something there. And also I think in general, we’re seeing Elasticsearch and databases and a lot of the structural things still are even more so offering on-Prem. It might be literally on-Prem, it might be in your AWS cloud, but it’s your cloud, not our cloud. And so I think there’s just still opportunity there that I wouldn’t want to be totally out of the game, especially because no other help desk software, nobody knew when Help Desk software is offering it. None of the existing players are offering it who didn’t already offer it in the past. And so I feel like it is a little bit of a competitive advantage there where it’s like we’re going up against other poorer solutions than just the intercoms of the world with infinite money. It’s like, no, this can be a little niche that we have some advantages in.  Rob Walling:No, I think that makes sense. I may seem off topic, but I have a question for you about, well, you were written on some PHP that you hacked together 20 years ago, but then I know at a certain point you integrated and you’re pretty heavily involved in the community. I think you mentioned some of that earlier. Laravel just raised 57 million, I don’t know, two weeks ago maybe. What’s your thinking on that and what that means for the future of Laravel?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so I think it’s really exciting. I mean, I run the official Laravel job board. Taylor Twell, the creator of Laravel, worked at UserScape with me for three years. My company’s name is,  Rob Walling:I didn’t know that. Oh, what a trip.  Ian Landsman:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Did he work on HelpSpot?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, yeah. And some other new stuff. In one of my distraction periods, he worked on some new stuff. He worked on HubSpot. But yeah, I actually found him, he was working at a shipping company and I found Laravel and I was like, wow, this is awesome. I want to have a framework to work on new versions of HubSpot with as well as other ideas. And I didn’t like any of the other PHP frameworks even up to then, which is 2010 or something like that. So I reached out to him. I was looking to hire a developer. Anyway, I ended up hiring him. He worked the first three or four months at user scape, just building out Laravel actually in some of the more enterprisey things. It didn’t have already caching and some other things. And then, yeah, we did the conferences together and stuff. Then ultimately he built Forge, which is the main revenue producer at Laravel. It’s like a hosting platform or manager. Then that started making a lot of money, and I was like, okay, you should go run that. And so he did. But we’ve stayed close friends and I’m definitely friends with a lot of people in the Laravel community. So yeah, I think the thing is he turned that into a bootstrapped and very profitable business, and again, kind hit that point where he had some bigger ambitions basically to launch this thing called Laravel Cloud, which is going to be Heroku, but for PHP and Laravel, basically, it’s kind of like the shorthand, but that kind of thing obviously requires just even if you have a very profitable business, it’s ultimately you’re going to need a lot of very expensive engineers and lots of servers and security people and all this stuff that starts to get into, if I’m paying, I’m making up numbers here, have no idea what they’re paying. But if you’re paying a security guy $800,000 a year, let’s say, or whatever, that starts to be a lot of money. So to chase those ambitions, that’s what he’s done. So I think so far so good. Like you said, it’s only been a couple months since they raised, so  Rob Walling:Now I want to ask you something that I asked you offline, and it was about what’s your biggest fear today? Looking ahead, you’ve run this business for 20 years, and you mentioned it was like how can AI potentially impact this? You want to talk us through your thinking?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so I think this is a topical one. So I think customer service is more directly in the crosshairs of even current AI capabilities to some degree. Obviously you can make the case for like, well, every job is going to be affected or whatever, who knows? But I think this is one where it’s like it’s a cost center. A lot of companies look at As, and they’re like, okay, if AI can do a reasonable job, maybe we’re willing to make changes there. So yeah, I just think it’s a big unknown. I think so far it hasn’t been really disruptive at all, but that doesn’t mean it won’t. There’s definitely been some companies that have made big moves, like Klarna got a lot of press for moving almost all their support to ai, but again, that is a very particular use case where they don’t have a lot of different types of questions. Basically it’s like, I want a refund, how do I pay my bill? So I think a very good use case for an ai, they had poor service ratings to begin with, so it’s like, are the AI people going to do any worse? Probably not. So you have some differences there, but yeah, who knows? So I mean on the one hand it’s like those fears of just might consolidate down to a few big AI players who do a fantastic job with it and they just gobble everything up, or is there going to be, is it not going to be a thing at all or more of a middle ground where since we have access to a lot of similar technology, at least ostensibly, right, is we can pay for open AI or whatever else, we can add those tools for the most part, I think there’s going to be probably some things that are going to be beyond our capability, but so I think that’s definitely just a big unknown and we haven’t had that in a long time. And the help desk space, it’s been pretty stable. So this is definitely a new thing that’s out there and it’s like, we’ll see how it goes. We’re definitely adding AI features and maybe that’s just kind of be kind of where it ends up, but we’ll see.  Rob Walling:That makes sense. Just out of curiosity, what’s the first one or two AI features you’re adding?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so very early on we did your standard writing helpers. We went farther than most of the other help desk tools I’ve seen have gone where you can define your own prompts and tools for the agents, but still it’s ultimately more on the writing and human creation side. But from there we are working on doing things like auto triaging where it can route inbound tickets to the right categories or right agents and things like that. So that’s going to be one of the first more sort of offensive minded, more active AI elements that we’re going to be adding. And then from there we have some different ideas about how we might do auto responding in a way that’s maybe a little bit safer. So obviously everybody’s trying to go for the holy grail of the AI just responds. You give it anything and it can just respond, but maybe there’s some in-between ground there where it’s more of a human response, but we use the AI to maybe figure out what’s the right response or some different things like that. So some stuff in r and d, some stuff very close to shipping. So that’s kind of where we’re at with it. But it is a big sort of sea change much when I started the company, which is like everybody’s using client server apps or just pure email, and that was the big shift and now it seems like there might be another big shift. I don’t know if it’ll be, it could be bigger than that. It could be less than that. I dunno, who knows, but we’ll see.  Rob Walling:So last question for you today before I let you go, I asked offline, I said you named HelpSpot. How did you feel when all these other help desks launched with help? Right, so there was Help Scout and help somewhere else, and what did you say to me?  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so those don’t bother me at all. There’s lots of whatever variations, but I thought the spot was kind of my unique thing. I liked the spot and Dharmesh Shaw, who’s the co-founder of HubSpot, was in Joel on software with us and kind of in our circles. And then he starts HubSpot and stole my spot like dude, and now it’s HubSpot. And obviously anytime I say HubSpot and HubSpot and people get confused even more than with Help Scout, although that one does get confused as well sometimes. But yeah, I’d say in terms of naming irks HubSpot,  Rob Walling:HubSpot  Ian Landsman:Kind of takes the pride from me.  Rob Walling:Sometimes that happens, sometimes it happens. Seemed to have  Ian Landsman:Done it. I like Dharmesh though. DH is great. Alright. He’s a great  Rob Walling:Guy. He’s so gracious and he still, when I wrote this SA playbook, I emailed and said, would you give me an endorsement? And he’s like, of course. And he gave this great endorsement. I put it on the cover of the book. It was so nice. It was like, I’ve been learning from Rob for years. You should too or something. I’m like, oh, you’re the  Ian Landsman:Awesome man. That’s crazy. He’s so good. Yeah, a few times I’ve talked to him over the years too. It’s just like, yeah, he’s still like the guy from in the for, you know what I mean? It’s like he’s a billionaire now, but he’s still kind of just humble. The same guy.  Rob Walling:Humble and just,  Ian Landsman:Yeah. That’s great.  Rob Walling:Ian Lansman, thanks for joining me today. Folks want to keep up with what you’re working on, obviously helpspot.com to see the app, and you are Ian Lansman on X Twitter. Anything else you’d like folks to check out? I know you have a few podcasts.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, the other thing, I guess the other main thing, if you want to keep up with what I’m doing is mostly technical is my podcast I do with Aaron Francis, and it’s more somewhat technical. There’s a little bit technical, but mostly it’s business and other topics, so it’s more entertaining, I’d say. Yeah, so check that out. We have a lot of people seem to like that, so that’s been fun the last year or so, working on that. Again, one of my little, I can’t really justify it on an ROI basis purely, but it’s a fun thing that I get to work on and is exciting to do.  Rob Walling:Awesome.  Ian Landsman:Yeah, so check me out  Rob Walling:There.

We all have strengths and weaknesses. You don’t want blind spots. A blind spot is a weakness that you are not aware of. When you have a weakness and you know about it, you can work around it. If you are the founder who bounces from one thing to the next next who follows each distraction and you realize, you know what, I’m never going to focus on anything long enough to build something great, then you can acknowledge that weakness and stick with things longer than you think you should. But if you’re not aware of it, how can you work around it?  It’s another episode of Startups. For, the Rest, Of Us. As always, I’m your host, Rob Walling. This week I’m flying solo As I talk through a few topics I’ve been mulling over these past few weeks and months. The first one is going to be about distractions, good distractions, bad distractions, micro, macro, and talking about how to avoid the ones that will derail your plans. I also want to talk about weaknesses versus blind spots. I want to look at how everyone, even the successful founders around you struggle. And then if we have time, I’m going to cover a topic about how you don’t have to be right all the time. In fact, you don’t even need to be right the vast majority of the time to be successful. Before I dive into the topics, if you haven’t picked up a copy of the SaaS Playbook, it has sold just about 30,000 copies.  I actually haven’t run the numbers in about a month, and last I checked it was at about 29,000. The book is selling really well, and the reviews and ratings and comments both on X, Twitter, Amazon and other places are really encouraging. And it seems the book is resonating with a lot of people. If you haven’t picked it up, SaaS playbook.com or you can get it on Amazon or Audible if you have picked it up, I would love it if you leave me a five star review on Amazon or Audible. That helps people find the book and it helps people gauge whether it’s going to be helpful for them. And with that, let’s dive in to my first topic about distractions. I was going to title this segment, how to Stay Focused even when there are things around you that you’d prefer to be doing. What I realized is all distractions are not bad.  So I have a couple dichotomies in this section that I want to talk through. The first is I do think there are good distractions. There are distractions that help your mental health. There are distractions that make you happy. There are distractions that have long-term benefits that might distract you from your goals. Your goal is to launch a company or build a company to five, 10, 15 million wherever you’re going. And a quote distraction is anything that maybe you have to spend time doing that isn’t that? And examples of good distractions are going outside, going for a walk, working out, spending time with your family, your kids. Now you might be saying, Rob, spending time with my family or my kids, my spouse? That’s not a distraction. It’s not. I don’t view it as that in my worldview per se, but if we’re looking at a technical definition of your goal is to do X, anything that isn’t getting there is, you could phrase it as a distraction from that.  Even having a lovely conversation with a friend when you should be focused on shipping a podcast episode could be a good distraction. That’s actually what happened to me with this particular episode. It was Friday afternoon and I wanted to ship this episode so that our editor could start getting it ready. And I was having a delightful conversation that wasn’t getting me towards this goal of shipping this episode, but I asked myself, what is the cost of engaging with this distraction? And that’s a thing that I want you to ask yourself about every distraction that comes up from here and for the rest of your life. Can you imagine if I could actually have that impact on your life, that’d be great. But even for the next day or the next week, what is the cost of engaging with this distraction and what is the benefit of engaging with it?  The benefit of spending time with your spouse or your kids or people you love is scientifically proven. Humans are so community and relationship driven, there are all kinds of benefits. What is the cost? Well, the cost is I can’t spend that time working on my product or my business or getting that podcast episode shipped. And so as long as you do it in moderation, you’re fine. You spend an hour or two hours or three hours doing something that is a distraction. You can get your work done, you can get your stuff done. If you spend 30, 40, 50 hours a week, some folks who get addicted to video games or addicted to a substance, addicted to alcohol, and they use these things as a distraction, that’s when it breaks down, is when it moves from moderation to perhaps overindulgence. So when you ask yourself, what is the cost of engaging with this distraction?  Well, if it’s a half hour conversation with a friend, if it’s an hour or two with family, friends or kids, in a lot of cases, that’s going to be the right call. The benefit outweighs the cost in those instances. But then let’s look at playing video games 30, 40, 50 hours a week. What is the cost of that? Well, it’s pretty significant. I imagine it’s going to take a toll on relationships. It’s going to take a toll on your ability to push your business forward. And while there is benefit to playing a video game or having an old fashioned on a Friday afternoon, there is benefit to these activities that make you happy, might be good for your mental health, they might put you around people that you enjoy spending time with. It comes back to this moderation and the cost of engaging with something for an hour versus 10 hours is much different.  Now, I’ve talked a lot about in the moment distractions, I might call these micro distractions where it’s spending time with someone and playing video games, whatever, versus macro. So what are macro distractions? These are bigger decisions. Let’s launch an entirely new product. Let’s translate our app into Spanish. Let’s make a huge strategic decision that is going to take months and months and hundreds of person hours to implement. Even building a side project. When your first effort, your startup isn’t growing as fast as you want it to be, is that distraction a good thing or a bad thing? Well, I’ll come back to this. Number one, is it in moderation? And two, what is the cost of engaging with this potential distraction? And the macro ones are a little trickier because the worst distractions masquerade as productivity. I want to say that again, the worst distractions masquerade as productivity.  Because if I know it’s a distraction, if I know, again, it’s playing video games, it’s anything I do for a hobby, I would say, oh, it’s a distraction from work. Again, that’s not my worldview, but let’s be very black and white about it in this segment. And if it’s obvious, and I know it’s a distraction, it’s okay. But I see a lot of entrepreneurs who think that reading more business books, reading hard thing about hard things or a biography about an entrepreneur, they feel like that is educating them on how to start a company. And to me, it’s a distraction. Masquerading is productivity. One of my most popular blog posts back when I was still blogging was called Startup Founders Should Stop Reading Business Books And don’t take the title literally because isn’t the SaaS Playbook a business book? It is. But in the post I talked about how highly tactical, highly prescriptive books like the SaaS Playbook or Traction by Gabriel Weinberg, even like EOS, things that give you information that actually improves your business.  I put those in a category training of actually showing you tactics and strategies that will get you there faster. Reading books by Malcolm Gladwell, and even a lot of, I mean I like Seth Godin’s books, but a lot of Seth Godin and just frankly, most business books that are out there are just not going to help you grow a startup faster. Take this as someone who reads 30, 40 books a year, I have 900 books in my Audible account that I read books via audio. Obviously if you’ve listened to this podcast for any length of time, I am Pro book. I’ve just written my fifth book, but I know when I’m listening to most books and most podcasts, even if they are business oriented, that they are a distraction, but many entrepreneurs don’t. And that’s when distractions masquerade as productivity. Here’s another distraction that I see masquerading is productivity.  In our circles of entrepreneurs, it’s launching another product without marketing the one you’ve already launched. Or how about this? It’s focusing on writing more code or answering support tickets or doing something that’s certain without selling what you’ve already built without marketing and selling the thing you’ve already built. Because that’s hard, it’s scary, it’s uncertain. It’s where the resistance lies. It’s what you don’t want to do as a technical founder. So what are the takeaways from this one? I want you to keep in mind this question of what is the cost of engaging with this distraction and what is the benefit of engaging with this distraction? Because the benefit of reading a business book might be it’s just fun. It’s what I do in my off time. It recharges me, and I understand and admit that this is not being productive. It’s a hobby that I have.  And I think weighing the cost versus the consequences, as you think about distractions and just being deliberate with your time, that’s it. If you’ve known me for any length of time, the value that I put on relationships and on my relationships with my wife and my kids and my friends for that matter, so you’ll know that I’m pro you spending all the time with all the people that you want to feed your soul. I just want you to keep in mind the cost versus the benefit, and to be extremely aware of distractions that masquerade themselves as productivity. At the end of that story is I had a distraction yesterday. I knew that the benefit of it was, it made me happy, and the cost was that I might have to record this episode on a weekend. And here I am Saturday afternoon recording it. And you know what?  That’s the decision I made. I’m here for it. My next topic is another dichotomy. It’s weaknesses versus blind spots. So I was interviewed on a podcast last week and the host started asking me about personality tests like Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, Colby, a StrengthsFinder. We were kind of batting some stuff around, and I never remember my results from these tests. I actually have taken all of them, I believe, and what I do is I read through, I take what I can learn from them, I internalize that and say, oh, yeah, I should do that. And then sometimes I’m like, that’s not me at all. And then I kind of forget. I don’t remember what number I’m on the Enneagram. I always have to look it up, but when I pull it up, I’m usually like, oh yeah, that’s totally me. It describes me and my strengths and my weaknesses.  I think it’s pretty good at it. Now you have to take these things for what they’re worth. Some of them are put together by researchers who have 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 people take these and they normalize the results. And they are quite scientifically, I’ll say, accurate, as accurate as you can get with something like this. And then there are other ones that are kind of made up by people not really tested, and you got to take it for what it’s worth. So I always hold them with a grain of salt, but I have found them helpful for me over the years to learn just a little more about my weaknesses. So we were talking on this podcast and I had this epiphany on the spot, and I’d never said this before. I said, weaknesses are fine. We all have strengths and weaknesses. You don’t want blind spots.  A blind spot is a weakness that you are not aware of. When you have a weakness and you know about it, you can work around it. If you are the founder who bounces from one thing to the next, next who follows each distraction, who maybe has a little bit a DHD, whether it’s clinical or whether it’s just something in your personality and you realize, you know what? I’m never going to focus on anything long enough to build something great, then you can acknowledge that weakness and stick with things longer than you think you should. But if you’re not aware of it, how can you work around it? If your weakness is that you don’t like doing hard things or you don’t want to do or work on anything that you don’t want to work on, and let’s say you are a maker, you’re a builder and you want to write code, you want to build websites, you want to build products.  If you know that’s a weakness, and you’ll listen to this show or you’ll read books about this topic or hear opinions and advice from folks in your mastermind. If you’re in a community like MicroConf, connect wherever you are getting advice. If you don’t realize that you are constantly doing that and avoiding the hard things and only really doing what you want to do and justifying it with, well, that fits for my personality. You have a blind spot. And the way to know you have a blind spot usually is if you have smart people around you, successful, smart people who are kind of all telling you the same thing and you keep not listening to them and you’re not finding the success that you want. You probably have a blind spot. Blind spots are really tough. The hard part is you don’t know you have them.  And turning blind spots into weaknesses and learning about a blind spot and kind of admitting that you just have that as a weakness eliminates it, right? So how do you learn about your weaknesses? Well, I think there are three ways, right? There’s introspection. There’s asking yourself, why do I fail at things? Am I the one that starts too many things, never finishes? Am I the one that never starts things after I finish? Am I the one that makes too much? I avoid conflict. I avoid doing hard things, things I don’t want to do, like marketing or sales? Do I avoid hard work? Maybe my weaknesses is I just never learned how to work hard. I don’t have any discipline. Maybe my weaknesses is I’m really disorganized. I think there’s some introspection to be done here. I do think personality tests have been helpful for me.  I’m not going to prescribe them for you, but I have taken four, maybe five, and I think I listed most of them earlier in this segment. But I have found those helpful for identifying potential weak spots, especially I remember the Enneagram is really good at this. It will say, this is a strength, and here’s the shadow side of that strength because every strength we have when taken too far is a weakness. And I think the Enneagram does a good job of identifying that. So personality test is number two. The other one is people around you and whether you need to ask them, what are the things that I keep screwing up that you’ve noticed? And again, this is maybe it’s your spouse. These are hard conversations. I mean, it can be hard to hear this and just admit like, yeah, that’s me. This is something.  This is a blind spot that I have that I’m going to turn into a weakness. Again, having strengths and weaknesses is human. Having blind spots is something that if you want to achieve and you want to be a successful entrepreneur, you can do it with blind spots, but they will hold you back. And I absolutely know founders who have blind spots, who ask opinions from smart people, hear about the blind spots and still don’t do anything about them. And it’s that same exact behavior that happens over and over and over is the reason that I see them not succeeding. And it’s tough because if you just can’t engage with it and admit and be okay, oh, this is a weakness, then it’s going to be something that comes up over and over and it’s going to be detrimental to your success. There was introspection. There were personality tests.  And the third one asking folks around you, and I think, look, this can be co-founder can be folks in a mastermind, can be again, spouse, siblings, anyone who’s close to you, who has watched you work and watched how you succeed and why you succeed and has watched you fail and has seen why that has happened. All of these are data points. There’s probably no one individual that knows all of your weaknesses, including you at this point, but you gather the data and you take it for what it’s worth. And start to think, when I look at who I want to be, do I want to be a successful entrepreneur, will look at other successful entrepreneurs, folks who come on this show. Folks I mentioned on this show, you’re Jason Cohen’s, your Heat, and Shaws, Ben Chestnut, Dharma Shaw. A lot of folks who I’ll say are successful and they’re on podcasts where they speak up MicroConf, you can start to see how they operate and you can get a sense of their thinking when they’re interviewed or if they write stuff or do talks and to ask yourself, can I operate like that?  Am I operating at that level? And if not, why? And it’s not to copy. I’m not trying to copy anyone or put them on a pedestal. No one is perfect. We all have strengths, we all have weaknesses, but there are always folks that are ahead of you. I know there are many folks ahead of me and they have helped me over the years reflect on myself and say, why have I not achieved what a Jason Cohen Heat and Shaw Dharmesh, I can name all the names again, but why am I not as successful as them? And maybe it’s just choices I made. Maybe it’s I focused more on my family, maybe just my starting point. We say whatever. There could be a bunch of reasons or it may be, huh, because they overcame their weaknesses. And it took me a while. It took me a long time, I think, to turn some of my blind spots into things that I was aware of.  So hope you enjoyed those thoughts today on weaknesses versus blind spots. The next topic is the idea that everyone struggles. And this actually came from a conversation I was having with Ruben Gomez, founder Sewell, he’s been on the podcast many times. He told me that someone else told him, they said, you are so successful. It makes me feel better that you have trouble at times, that sometimes you struggle with things. And I thought to myself, well, of course I’ve talked to Ruben almost monthly basis for 14 years or something, so I know his struggles because we talk about them. But it’s so interesting on the internet how things might not come across that way. And Ruben of all people is not someone who is humble, bragging and only talks about the good. I mean, he’ll talk about all the stuff, but it isn’t always apparent just how much struggle each of us is going through.  And frankly, I’m just going to Mia Culpa here, how many mistakes each of us makes even once we kind of know what we’re doing. The level of mistakes that I’ve made in the past 10 years is pretty incredible. So why have I achieved, I would say each year I’ve been more successful than the last. I’ve had more wins than last. I’m happier now. I make more money. Whatever measure I’ve built, more successful companies, I struggle less. I am less stressed. So by all measures, I would say my life has gone up into the right, and yet I’ve done a lot of things that haven’t worked, and I guess this is maybe more of a personal episode than I’ve done in a while, but I wanted to walk through a few of those failure, you know how they failures. I don’t even want to label. They’re just things that I did that basically kind of didn’t work long term.  They were decisions that I made that were a lot harder than I thought or just didn’t turn out the way that I thought. One of them, man, going back to 2013, so this is 11 years. When we launched Trip, I had some hubris about the fact that it was going to work, that I knew what I was doing, that I’m a successful entrepreneur. It was my fifth company. Yeah, MicroConf was fourth. TinySeed six. Anyways, it’s my fifth company. And I was like, you know what? I know what I’m doing. I have a bit of money in the bank. I have some experience. I have a good network, I have an audience. I’m a product person. I’ve done this before. It’s just going to work. And then we launched and it didn’t work, and it plateaued at eight. You’ve heard the story plateaued at eight grand a month for months on end.  And I was just distraught and I had a moment where I was like, I’m supposed to be good at this. People listen to me about being an entrepreneur. Don’t I know how to do this? I thought I knew what I was doing. And it turns out I figured it out. It was grinding, it was working with Derek to figure out the next thing to launch and how to pivot the product. And we did. And it took us, I dunno, maybe nine months from launch, nine agonizing months from launch to get to the point where we had product-market fit, and then things took off like a rocket, and then it was like, okay, I do know what I’m doing. I was just overconfident that it would work right away. If you want to hear all that agony, by the way, go to Startup Stories podcast. You can look in any podcast app or you can go to startup stories podcast.com.  Derek and I recorded 10 to 15 minutes a week for a year, and then I cut it all to actually not all of it together. I think it was nine hours of audio and I cut it down to 90 minutes and kind of just packed it all in. So you can hear this longitudinal agonizing trip towards product-market fit as we finally did get there. But in the middle, I have a little bit of PTSD. When I listened to it, it was such a hard time of not even knowing what we were building and if we’re building anything for anyone and if it was all just a waste of time. So that was one, like I said, 10 or 11 years ago. How about MicroConf Locals? We launched local events. We are going to do, I’m trying to think of how many we did in our biggest year, but we have our two big flagship events where we have the one in us, the one in Europe.  We’re going to be in Croatia here and just a week or two after this comes out. But then we wanted to do local events, which were like these First, we were going to do one day events where it’s like eight hours, four speakers and fly into some major cities, and we started doing those and the uptake was not great, and it was a lot of effort. And so we said, well, what if we just make ’em like three hours in the afternoon, almost like a happy hour? I would either do a short talk or I’d interview someone. So I would fly in with a producer and we would basically produce a three hour event. And they were fine. The events themselves were really good, and the people who came, it was awesome, but the local interest wasn’t there. We couldn’t charge enough even to make them break even.  We were losing money on them, and it was burning me and the producer out because we were on the road all the time, and I went to, I don’t even know, it was 10 events, 12 events last year. It’s just way too much travel. And it wasn’t just the being there, it was getting on the plane. It would wreck 48 hours, 72 hours of stuff that I could be doing that’s not being on a plane, right? It’s recording podcasts, it’s recording videos, it’s writing another book. It’s all the opportunity cost of the travel and the time. And so that was an effort that we decided to, I’ll say put on pause, but it’s done. And so is it a mistake? Is it failure? Well, we certainly struggled, certainly had trouble at times. My whole team burned out last about a year ago, including me, and it was rough, but it was a calculated bet of if this works, it’s going to be great.  We can do more. We can have local MCs. We had all these plans, but the interest wasn’t there, so I don’t regret it. It’s not a mistake. But we did struggle and we agonized. I agonized over whether to keep doing them. These are hard decisions. Strategic decisions are big and difficult, and it’s like how do you make hard decisions, right? This is a question. How do you know when to quit? How often do you hear this question asked of anyone? Right? It comes into this podcast. People ask Seth Godin all the time. He wrote that book, the Dip, but how do you know when to quit? It was because I knew when it was time, maybe I waited a little too long, but I was out of ideas and it wasn’t working, and I was like, I just want this to be done. And that’s how we knew when it was time to quit another effort.  That certainly is not a failure. It was the YouTube channel, and the YouTube channel is still doing really well. It grew very quickly over about 18 months, I think we went from like 10,000 to maybe 80,000 subscribers, and then it plateaued. The worldwide audience of entrepreneurs who want to build SaaS companies isn’t that big. Maybe, I don’t dunno, a hundred, 150,000. It’s not millions of people. So to plateau at 80 ish is not the end of the world. But the question was, so do we keep doing this? We were shipping a video a week. It was an absolute grind, and the grind was worth it When it was successful, the grind was worth it when we were adding a thousand to 1500 subscribers every week. Love it. You see that number going up into the right. I can grind for a very long time when that’s happening, but when it starts being three or 400 a week, I have to ask myself, is this worth my time to outline record the cost to edit producer Ron’s time, just all the effort we’re putting behind this?  Or what if we did less? What if we didn’t do any YouTube videos? What if we did half as many, so it’s every other week we could put that time, that energy, and frankly, those dollars into some other way to build the audience. And so again, not a mistake, but it is a struggle and a hard decision. It was challenging. I think it was six, seven months ago when I finally said, man, we’ve been plateaued for six months. I think we just have to turn this attention to something else. And frankly, we turned that towards the course. SaaS launchpad.co. You haven’t checked it out. It’s all about finding ideas, validating, building a launch list and launching. It’s really the second course I’ve ever built. First one was 14 years ago. This one is way, way better, more complete, more thorough. The course is $500 and it’s worth it.  I mean, I’ll just say that it’s the best course, certainly best course I’ve ever produced and one of the best pieces of content I’ve ever produced. It’s almost 10 hours of content. It’s really in depth. And if you want to learn more about launching your own SaaS SaaS launchpad.co, so hopefully that segment makes you feel better if you weren’t aware that even successful people struggle at times. Alright, last topic. This one’s a quicker one. I was watching a video, I believe it was Roger Federer, who is an incredibly successful tennis player. I believe he was giving a graduation speech. He said, I’ve played in 1,526 singles matches. I won 80% of those matches, but I only won 54% of the points. So let that sink in, barely more than half of the points and yet won 80% of the matches. I love this metaphor as you don’t have to be right that often.  I won’t belabor this metaphor and start talking about baseball and how the all time grades only hit the ball, what 30, 40% of the time you get. The point is that successful founders aren’t right all the time. They aren’t right a hundred percent of the time. They’re not even right. 90% of the time. They might, I mean, I don’t know what the number is, but is it 60? It might be be as low as 60, but they try enough things, they move fast enough and enough of their things work. I was talking about this point, and Ruben actually pointed out to me that when I say enough of the things that they try work, he said, you know what you should include there is that they usually don’t work right off the bat that they do work if you iterate on it and focus on it.  And I really liked that distinction. When I say they work on a lot of things and most of the things they do work is most 55, 60, 65, 70, it’s in there somewhere. Seriously, it’s not 80 or 90%. 80 or 90% of the things I do don’t work. But the ones that do have asymmetric upside and they push the business forward and they push my life forward and they work, and that’s the pattern that I see with successful entrepreneurs and frankly, someone who’s successful at all with their life. They just generally learn to make good decisions and follow through. But I want to underscore that point of for it to work for you to be successful on 54% of those points as Roger Federer, that usually won’t just happen right off the bat. It’s not like I’m going to start this marketing approach. Yeah, it’s just going to work. I’m going to launch this product. Oh, it just worked right off the bat because successful folks, 54% of the time are right. That’s not how it works. You launch something, you iterate, you take feedback. You try that marketing approach, you iterate, you take feedback, and eventually you kind of grind it to the point where it works. Usually 55, 60, 60 5% of the time. That’s going to be it for me today. Thank you so much for listening this week and every week.

That’s a signpost ahead. Your next stop startups For, the Rest Of Us. Welcome to this week’s episode. I am Rob Walling and you might recognize that intro from the amazing and talented Rod Sterling who created and wrote so many episodes of one of my favorite series, the Twilight Zone, but this is not the Twilight Zone. This is Startups For, the Rest, Of Us, where every week since 2010, I’ve shipped an episode focused on helping bootstrapped and mostly bootstrap startup founders. We’re founders who seek freedom, purpose and relationships, and we don’t want to sacrifice our life in order to build our startup, but we want our startup to change our life for the better. Today’s conversation is pretty incredible. It’s a founder who effectively bootstrapped. He uses the word bootstrap because they raised a couple hundred thousand dollars and if you’re in venture capital land that is bootstrapped, usually it’s anything less than a million is considered. Bootstrap built his company with a co-founder for 15 years and had three subsequent exits to private equity where he sold a portion of his equity in each one. The last exit was for $615 million. It’s an incredible story and my guest today is extremely knowledgeable and extremely accomplished. Before we dive into my conversation, the SaaS Launchpad is live. It is the best course I have ever created. It is the most comprehensive. There are reviews coming in already of people who are blown away by the depth and the quality and the quantity of the content. It’s at SaaS launchpad.co if you’re interested. And as of the day this episode goes live, if you buy the course in the next six days before September 30th, you’re going to be able to get on a live q and a call with me where we’re going to do a group call, talk about questions people have from the course or probably about anything else. To be honest, SaaS launchpad.co. I’m so confident in this course we have a 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee, so really there is no risk for you to check it out. That’s SaaS launchpad.co. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation. Jeff, thanks so much for joining me on Startups For, the Rest, Of Us. Hey Rob, thanks for having me. Yeah, so as background for folks, you are at retired founder on Twitter, and your story is pretty incredible. Your, I’ll call it your personal H one, which is your Twitter bio says, retired SaaS founder sold the business for more than $600 million Seeking purpose and community post exit. You bootstrapped a company and sold it for a crazy amount of money. So why hasn’t everyone heard of you? Why is it in your name across the marquee, there’s people with huge YouTube followings that have done a fraction of what you’ve done, what’s going on  Jeff:There? I guess the obvious answer would be, I must not be that interesting, but perhaps beneath that is I like to keep a low profile just for my own safety and security, and by being anonymous, it also helps me be completely authentic with anything I have to talk about.  Rob Walling:And then we’ll dig into that today you’re willing to talk numbers and all the stuff you were telling me in the pre-interview, I was like, whoa, okay, that’s great. And so that is, you’re anonymous, but I have vetted that you in fact have done these things. And so folks listening as the first anonymous guest, it’s kind of neat to have someone who has had such an incredible journey. I want to start by taking us to the end, so to speak, the exit and you can explain how it’s actually exits, but what I really want to go to is that moment that you refresh that bank balance and you realize I never have to work again. I’m all set. What was that emotion? What was that feeling?  Jeff:Oh man, the first word that comes to mind is relief. And following that probably enthusiasm. As a bootstrap founder, it’s very difficult to take a lot of risk. So when we sold the business the first time to a private equity firm, and if anyone wants to contact me on Twitter or wherever, I’d be glad to share details about who our banker was, who the private equity firms were, but I’m going to keep those anonymous as well for now. But I was excited to work with people and actually be able to put money into the business and pursue some of the crazy ideas that I had as a founder. But when you’ve got 98% of your net worth wrapped up in your business, it’s really challenging to say, Hey, you know what? This is a crazy idea and I think it’s a five x payoff. If it works, it’s hard to pursue those things. But the first thing was relief. Man, I listened to your latest podcast and your guest talked about sleeping for 14 hours. If anyone gets to retirement, I dunno if this is good news or bad news, but the best thing is the sleep. It’s just so great to sleep. It’s so peaceful. Oh, it’s so peaceful. I went a dozen or more years where I was asleep, I was unconscious, but I was still at work. My dreams were all involving work and to be able to actually get to sleep is great. So that was the first thing,  Rob Walling:The biggest perk. Yeah, and to give folks an idea of the timeline real quick, we’ll talk through this in more detail, but you co-founded the business in 2003. You sold a majority share of it to private equity in 2017, so 14 years. But then you got a what they call a second bite at the apple and a third bite at the apple, meaning you rolled equity and you had another exit in 2020 and then you had a final exit in 2022. That’s the $615 million exit and it was 14 times a r. So that’s an interesting thing. Let’s talk about that real quick because people ask all the time, if I’m doing 2 million and growing at blah, what’s my revenue multiple? And it’s always like, it just depends. I can do a bell curve of the past 20 exits that I know of. I can give you the range, but I know a friend of mine who is a m and a advisor and he got someone a 23 XARR offer and then I heard someone three days ago who got a two XARR. So is that the range? It’s two to 23, it just depends, right? It depends on the space and the market and the growth and the this and that. There are the most common parts of the bell curve for SaaS 10 to be in that, what is it four to? It’s about five to seven, but you see five to eight and it depends on the market. So 14 is a great, great multiple. Why was that the case?  Jeff:It was a combination of things. I mean the market was very strong at that moment in time in early 2022, so that can’t be disregarded, but the mental model I used when describing this to people considering selling their business is a slot machine, and I didn’t know this going in or I would’ve had some better numbers, but just excluding market conditions. You take your revenue is sort of the first real of a four real slot machine and then you take your gross margin. I’d never really calculated our gross margin. I mean I knew how the business worked, but I’d never really dug into what our gross margins were. We were about 90% gross margin. It was a mature product. It was all our own code and open source. We didn’t have any licensing costs. We had high gross margin. That’s real. Number two. Third is retention. I knew we took really good care of our customers. It was one of the reasons we had I think such a good outcome and took so long was our patients, but we took really good care of our customers. We had 117% net retention, so it was  Rob Walling:Negative 17% churn.  Jeff:Yeah, negative 17% churn.  Rob Walling:That’s unbelievable  Jeff:And happy to talk about some of the strategies that helped that. My favorite of which is short-term generous, long-term, greedy, which I’m glad to talk about later, but the fourth reel is growth, and at the time we sold the first time we got seven times revenue, so seven not nearly as good as 14 obviously. But if you think about that slot machine, our growth was only about 20, 22% a year when we sold. So if we would’ve had a hundred percent growth and 90% gross margin and 117%, that would’ve been a jackpot. But we were kind of like jackpot, jackpot potato for that last reel on growth, but perhaps the private equity company that acquired the majority stakes saw that we had. We had a lot of potential because we weren’t aggressively spending in sales and marketing at that time.  Rob Walling:And let’s give folks an idea of what the business was. We’re not going to name the business because very quickly someone could find your identity, but it was a bootstrapped SaaS company. And what industry did you operate in?  Jeff:Yeah, we were business to business security software and if anyone wants to find me, I’m not hiding, send me a message online or on Twitter or something and just like with you, glad to introduce myself, but it was business to business SaaS.  Rob Walling:Got it. And starting in oh three, there really wasn’t, I put in quotes, there wasn’t SaaS, constant contact was around and MailChimp was just, and Basecamp was a couple years later, but were you charging a subscription when you launched it in oh three or was it one time back then and then you migrated to subscription later?  Jeff:It was an abject failure to get licenses is the honest answer. That’s amazing. I’m a salesman by trade, so of course we were trying to get a hundred grand for the software and then the way it used to work is you’d pick 15, 20% maintenance ongoing, but we weren’t able to do that. We were two guys in a dog and the dog was a loner and nobody wanted to give us the money. It was really Salesforce that I recall as being one of the real earliest pay as you go, the difference in our case, we adopted the pricing model of a subscription, which I think was very healthy for customers and for the tech companies, but we were still OnPrem, so we were shipping servers, still probably shipping on-prem servers to customers, but it was really the licensing that was rather novel at that time in 2003, and again, driven out of necessity, not some kind of foresight or wisdom.  Rob Walling:Ben Chestnut, co-founder, MailChimp, I interviewed him at MicroConf, he basically said the same thing. He was like, we were just charging one time because that’s what we thought software was and then suddenly we realized we need, I don’t remember why they switched to subscriptions, but it was very much an accident for them as well. So talk to me, you told me offline that you started in oh three, you became profitable in oh seven, so four years of what I would call grinding. Were you working a day job at the same time? How can you be an unprofitable, bootstrapped company? Those two things, you don’t have burn rate because you don’t have cash in the bank.  Jeff:Yeah, I was not working another job. I was unemployable at the time for clarity as well. We did raise $350,000 of an angel round, so mostly bootstrapped  Rob Walling:Is how I should call  Jeff:It. And that was the last capital. That was the last capital then. And I had a previous company that I sold in a.com company that let’s not venture into waste time in the interview here, but I had a little bit of money left over from that after failing at a couple of things in between. So we were burning money at home for a long time. It was a tough first five years.  Rob Walling:So mostly bootstrapped is obviously what I refer to that as. So as you hit profitability in oh seven, what did the company look like? Was it still small? Was it you and your co-founder? Did you have much of a team?  Jeff:Yeah, it was a first year. We did a million dollars of revenue was 2007, I think we were at about seven employees then, so it was just the two of us for a year. We did $9,920 of revenue our first year in 2003. Yes, I remember. And I have a copy of the purchase order I could put my hands on right now.  Rob Walling:That’s cool.  Jeff:That was a big day. Yeah, a million dollars of recurring revenue  Rob Walling:In the journey between oh three and 18, which 15 years. That’s when you retired. You did the first part of your exit, partial exit in 17, then you retired in 18, and then you had these other exits afterwards because you just owned shares. Right. What I want to find out is do you have a memory of I guess one of the hardest time periods or one of the hardest moments, a time where you kind of said, well, this might be it, this isn’t going to work. Or maybe it was months of stress fighting spammer. There’s always, every entrepreneur has many of these stories, but you have any go-to story of like, this was terrible.  Jeff:Yeah, I’ll give you one early and I’ll give you one late. The one early is sort of a combination of stories, but I remember a year in two years in something like that, I mean we are doing almost no revenue and it’s just not working. And I think we were a little bit early for the market we were in and it’s security software, so it’s difficult to get a beach head and just thinking, man, if I had any other opportunity, I mean any opportunity like three grand a month and a dental plan and just like relief from the pain I’m going through, I would’ve jumped on it. And I remember a particular moment where I was fighting with the printer or something like that and I was just really angry and frustrated and I think that’s one of the things, I mean I hope your audience takes from me and from each other is that it’s hard, man. It’s hard and it’s lonely and having somebody to talk to authentically where you’re not in pitch mode and talking about how great it is and feeling like everybody else is doing great and you’re not, but it’s really hard. It was hard and it was lonely. The second one I’d give you was late in the process and was a contributor to deciding to sell the business, and this was 2015, I believe, where we were doing well and I had taken a loan, I built an office building for the company and I took a loan of $6 million with a personal guarantee. I didn’t have that kind of money, but the company had cashflow at that point to support that, and we had a security breach. Nothing was lost, but someone got through the first level of our security. It wasn’t our software as a piece of open source code. I don’t remember what it was, but we were stuck and one of our customers said, Hey, we’ve got a red light on the dashboard here. Somebody broke through the front line of security here and they’re checking the doors to the vault. Then another customer, same thing. So we were under attack at that moment in time and I just signed a loan for $6 million to build this and in security software, one bad line of code could ruin you, wasn’t our code, couldn’t fix it. Totally out of our hands, and that’s a moment, I won’t forget, that’s a moment that all the ships were down and we didn’t really have any ability to play the hand. It just, our team came together and when fix was available, we fixed it. But that’s one that I won’t forget.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that sounds terrifying and that the longer you do this, I’ve seen so many founders now get hacked, get cease and desist. I have employees embezzle have, it’s just these edge case things you hear about, you’re like, well, that’s such an, that’ll never happen, but it’s like, no, it’s either I have view across 191 companies, so that’s a law of large numbers. It’s going to happen to some of ’em. Or you had your one company but you did it for 15 years and so the odds of something happening in that timeframe is, and it’s terrifying. How did you handle it in the moment? Some people completely freeze up and don’t know what to do and panic and that’s there’s fight, flight or freeze I think are the reactions. Do you remember panicking and then calming down and saying, well, we just got to fix this or what was your MO there?  Jeff:Yeah, I got plenty of weaknesses, but panic is not one of ’em. Equanimity I think is one of my strong suits, but this was a case. I’m a salesman by trade, so I didn’t have any ability to understand really what was going on and had to rely on the team. And I believe it was a Friday night and we just got to the point where there wasn’t anything else we could do. I think we approached it rationally and then you talk about the events that just sort of happen to you. There’s just a big wheel in the sky that spins and sometimes your number comes up and that happens. That could be getting a disease or getting in a car wreck or in this case having a piece of software that you were using that had a vulnerability. And fortunately we were able to work through it. Fortunately, the other safeguards that were present in our software held strong. I dunno if it’s interesting, but a lot of security software you could say is like it’s an alarm or it’s a fence or a moat or a gate or something. We were a vault. We protected the vault of some very important customer information, casinos, law firms, banks, hospitals, things like that. So it was not a system that could fail without massive repercussions for everyone. So anyway, glad to have that behind.  Rob Walling:This is going to be a tricky question or maybe you’ve already thought about this, but why did the business work? Why did it work so well that it was obviously a massive success for you and your co-founder and even the private equity firms that bought it and resold it. What is at that core, feel free to talk about you and your co-founder that you executed Well, I think the founders themselves have to be pretty instrumental in any business like this working, but people say, well, it’s the market or the idea was the right time. We got a little lucky with timing. We got whatever. How do you think about why this business works so well?  Jeff:Yeah, a combination of things. It’s always a great question in a group to say, Hey, what percentage was success and what percent was luck? And it was definitely a combination. I think of it like winning a poker tournament. Sure it’s possible to not even know what you’re doing and just go in 20 times in a row and win. I think one, it was a good idea. It was my co-founder’s idea. It was ahead of its time, but it was a good idea and we caught a wave five years in, 10 years in that picked up steam. I would say we had a good division of labor in the startup where my co-founder was a brilliant coder. He was technical, I was sales, so if it had to do with code, it was him. If it had to do with the business, it was me and we stayed out of each other’s way, which was good. We didn’t go too far too fast. If I would’ve had an ability to raise venture capital early, I probably would’ve done it and that probably would’ve been a mistake. So again, we took the long view on things, short-term generous, long-term, greedy, anything we could do to get the product in the customer’s hands and using it, we know we would succeed in the long run. We deferred gratification, so we didn’t have a big fancy office. We had a crummy office for a long time while we were profitable. We didn’t get hit by a lightning bolt out of the sky is definitely one.  Rob Walling:So we just didn’t get killed in the stayed  Jeff:Alive, cease and desist letter sued by a customer, a breach, sued by, we never got sued, which is nice. So really a combination of things. Rob, over the long period of time, I mean I don’t want to shoo away any credit. I think we made more good decisions than bad decisions. I think we recovered quickly from our bad decisions. We weren’t afraid to take certain risks that had favorable payoff conditions and we weren’t in a rush. We went, I call it bootstrap. We had a small amount of money from outside investors that got us over the line.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s a big thing. I mean, there’s so many directions I want to take that I’ve talked a lot lately about how, or be it lately, about how I think success of when I look at TinySeed companies, are the founders multiplied by the market or the opportunity? And the reason it’s multiplied is let’s say you have a founder who’s a one out of 10. If we’re just going to have a numerical rating scale, but it’s a great market opportunity, they will execute mediocre and they may have a middling a success, but if you have a founder who’s a nine and they have a real market or it’s a market that they don’t get a little bit lucky with or they don’t hit at the right time or whatever, then it’s similar, it’s middling. And we see a few tiny sea founders just like you are such a good founder and I’m so sorry that you’re just not getting the traction. This sucks. But it sounds like between you and your co-founder, that division of labor, and it sounds like both of you really executed well and then you have that market and that multiple, you multiply the nine by nine or the 10 by 10, suddenly you’re at a hundred versus these are all contrived, but you get the idea what I’m saying. And there are more factors in that, right? I mean there’s luck involved and there’s all kinds of stuff, but it’s crazy to see such an outsized outcome. There just aren’t that many nine figure bootstrapped exits like this. So I want to touch on something you’ve said a couple times now and it’s short-term generous, long-term, greedy. Can you flesh that out? What you mean by that?  Jeff:I think this is one of the benefits of being a bootstrap company. We didn’t have a quarterly number that we needed to make, and that means you don’t ever sell the product to someone who’s not a good fit. You sure try not to. There could be an occasion where there’s a prospect and they really should buy your competitor’s product, but you need the money or you need to make your number for the quarter. And we never did that. And then there were occasions where maybe the person we were dealing with had a very low budget authority, including our first sale of $9,920 in December of 2003. And you think, well, geez, this is a customer that should be a hundred thousand dollars a year customer, $50,000 a year customer, and the person you’re dealing with is enthusiastic about it, but they can’t convince their management or they don’t have the budget. And we’d say, what do you got? Can you sign for 5,000? And we would do that. We would do that consistently. The way our licensing worked as well was the product did not have a feature that would exclude someone from using the product because they’d exceeded a license account. So we sold on concurrent licenses. There’s a number of ways to do it, and it was also a generous way to do it was concurrent versus named users, which people liked. And then if we thought, Hey, you’re going to need, let’s say 50 concurrent users and that’s whatever it is, 10 grand a month, we would say, I’ll tell you what, first year we’re going to charge you for five and take advantage of us. I mean, just rip us in half, get up to, I hope you get up to 75, catch up with you next year, and if that’s a problem, we will work with you from there. So you go from, you could be sitting around forever trying to get that 50 concurrent license thing, but I’ll sell it to you for cheap for five because I know you’re going to like the product. I know we’re going to take care of you. I would say also we had a methodology or a viewpoint that we never tried to avoid our customers. We had a phone number that spelled the company’s name and you could call that number and one of our people would pick up the phone and help you through a problem. And that the idea was always, let’s try to give great support where no matter what, even if you forgot your password, we’re not going to farm you out to someone else. We’re not going to send you through an IVR. We’re going to try to get a human to pick up the phone and then after we surprise and delight you with some great service, we’re going to take an opportunity to say, Hey, by the way, is there anyone else in the company maybe that could use the product? Or are there other things we could do better than once you’ve done a good job serving them? So that’s just another example of being generous and greedy at the same time.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that. It’s really long-term thinking, and I like the way you say long-term, greedy. It’s intriguing to be thinking that way because so many folks don’t think about running a company for 15 years. Right, myself included, although I have run MicroComp now for 15 years, I think 14, as you were going along, did it feel like 15 years or was it just something that you kind of didn’t question and you just did every day? Similar to I talk about why this podcast has shipped every week since 2010. People say, wow, that’s a long time. It doesn’t feel, I mean when I look back, it’s a long time, but this isn’t work for me. I do this, I love it. And frankly, MicroConf is just something, it’s just part of me and it’s what I do. My last SaaS company Drip was, it was not an identity, and I never thought I’d run that business for 15 years. So I’m just trying to give examples of some of those really fit of, I’m just going to do it and it did what it did and others, I keep going. So I’m curious to what your feelings were during that 15 years of working on it.  Jeff:Yeah, it’s a great question. I’d say time moved at different speeds in different parts of our history. So the first couple of years crawling over broken glass, it was like time in the dentist chair. It couldn’t have gone slower. The first few years felt like a hundred years once we got to profitable and had a pretty good sense that we were going to be okay, that part went fast. So from 2007 till the time we sold a majority share, that 10 years might’ve felt like two. Although there were some struggles of course along the way. I don’t mean to think it was all sunshine and roses during that 10 years, but that time was really good. We had a small team. It was a good team. We worked well together. It was small enough where you knew everybody. It was big enough that you could take a vacation and expect that the company would still be alive when you returned.  Rob Walling:I want to ask you a question that I think some people are probably thinking right now, which is with an exit like this, you yourself took home a tremendous amount of money. Is it just shy of a hundred million? Is that accurate?  Jeff:Yeah, the total, I’m happy to walk through the transactions if it’s useful, but yeah, I think that the total was about $88 million  Rob Walling:That went to you directly.  Jeff:That went to me from the equity sale in three chunks.  Rob Walling:How do you keep going? What do you do next? That money, I know it came in three chunks, but how do you think about how to stay busy? If I had that much money, I wouldn’t go back and grind, right? I mean, hell, I have way less money than that. I’m not going to go back and grind. You know what I mean? So it’s like how do you possibly think about what to do next to keep yourself happy, to have an impact, to keep learning, to stay sharp without maybe getting back in the game? Unless, did you ever consider getting back in the game?  Jeff:Yeah, boy Rob, I could go hours on this. I’ll try to distill it as best I can. Everyone has a number in mind. If I could get this amount of money, then I’d be set and I’d be done. Mine was 10 million. And I think most people, when you say, my number’s 10, you really think of 20. So that was life changing. I was done there. And then first check was 21, second check was about 43rd check was 27, 28. And I remember in vivid detail the day we sold cash in the check, taking my family out to dinner in a limousine, what we had to eat, I could bring you to the table where I sat. Second time we sold Rob $40 million. It closed early in the morning. I was in a conference room by myself. I don’t remember what I did that day. I mean, we might’ve gotten pizza that night. Honest to God, I don’t even remember, and I’m not sure how useful this is to your audience, but I mentioned this on another podcast I was on. I think most people have a default perfect amount of spending, meaning maybe you can afford to fly first class and stay in a nicer hotel and I dunno, have a decent car. Whatever it is, everyone has their sort of ideal amount of spend. And when you have less than that, life is of course painful because wanting to rise up to that. There’s also another side, and I can already feel the eyes rolling in the audience that my eyes would’ve been rolling as well, that when you’re above that, if you have more money than you can spend, it creates a certain kind of an issue as well. And just some examples of that are feeling the need to maybe go do it again or give it away, and it’s just more challenging than you’d think. I made a lot of the mistakes that I think people who sold their business make you do what the world tells you you should do. You go to try to work with nonprofits and you realize how frustrating and slow that is. If you’re a founder. I bought a bunch of stuff. I had four houses in a jet at one point and realized stuff isn’t where it’s at. Experience and community and relationships are much more valuable than that. And I also grossly underestimated how much I would miss the structure and the purpose and the identity that I had in my former life. And I know I’ve been talking a long time, I can hear myself talking, but I just want to say to the audience, if you’re rolling your eyes right now or you’re saying, what a moron, just believe me when I say when I was starting, I would’ve said the same thing. How is it possible you have this giant pile of money and you don’t just write off it at the sunset and spend the rest of your days with frozen drinks and sunsets and boats?  Rob Walling:Well, it’s boring. I did it for six months, and again, my exit was much smaller than yours, but took six months off after and I was like, I was in my early forties. This is not what I’m doing forever. I need to learn, me personally, I need to learn. I need to have an impact. I need to do all that. The thing I struggled with was my whole life growing up, we didn’t have much money, so it was always a constraint. I had a very scarce mindset around money, and a big part of me for entrepreneurship was like, I want to have the freedom to work on interesting things that I want to, but I also want to be set for life at some point. That was a goal. And so I achieved that goal and then I was like, whoa, I’m like 40 years. That’s been the driving goal for me. My North Star was to have enough money in the bank in cash that I never had to work again. And then I was like, so what do I do now? And I had MicroConf this podcast, I had stuff that I could work on and do, but I needed a new North star. And my new North Star became to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups that is now truly my North star. Everything I do with books, the podcast, YouTube, MicroConf, TinySeed, that’s what I do because it brings me joy and it is, I view it now as my legacy. Did you have a similar transition where you were like, my north star is growing the company or wealth or whatever, and then you had to take, I mean, it took me six plus months to figure mine out of thinking about it a lot. I was actually kind of stressed about it, but did you reorient around something new?  Jeff:Oh gosh, bie, congratulations. By the way, you have accomplished something. A lot of people in my situation or similar have not six months is a, you’re much smarter than me and a lot of others that I’ve worked, and I stood up a group called Beyond the Finish Line. It’s b tfl.org if anyone is in the same situation. But I can distill a lot of the conversation is this, I want you to picture a Venn diagram, two circles. One of them is doing something important with people and trust. It’s being back in the trenches. It’s going to war with your friends and being an important part and being useful in that. Okay, that’s one circle. And the other one is absolute freedom and autonomy and independence to do whatever you want anytime you want. And as it turns out, the joke is it’s not a Venn diagram. There’s two circles. There’s no overlap. That’s great. And so the key I believe, is to find something as you did, and I have friends that are in the group that have found something that is worthy of sacrifice of that second circle. So if there’s something that you feel passionate about or you feel like you’re giving back enough, you’re useful enough, you’re willing to say, I’m a skier. So I’m willing to say, you know what? We’ve got perfect ski conditions today. I got six inches of powder. It’s blue skies. The lines are short, it’s 20 degrees and the light’s good. And I have to say, I can’t do it. I can’t go out. I can’t go ski today. So it has to be something that’s worthy of sacrificing your independence. So kudos to you for finding that. And the North Star I use now, or I try to use now is energy. So if I’ve got something like I’m enjoying talking to you, I was looking forward to talking with you today. If it’s giving me energy, it’s good. And it doesn’t matter how much money you have in the bank, Robin, anyone else listening, it doesn’t matter how much money you have in the bank, if you’ve got low energy, life sucks. It doesn’t matter that you can push a button on your phone and have a plane come pick you up somewhere. If you’re not at looking forward to the day and you’re not looking forward to what you’re doing, your energy’s low. Life sucks. And if your energy’s high, it, maybe I’m working on a home repair project or something, if my energy’s good, life is good. So that’s the new scoreboard because it’s not money anymore.  Rob Walling:And that is a big mental shift that I think some people make and some people don’t. And so I want to wrap the interview and give folks a few calls to action. You have several different things that you’re working on. You already mentioned beyond the finish line, which is btl.org, and as you said, if someone is post economic, they can hit up there. In addition, you are at retired founder on Twitter and retired founder.com, and I wanted to read not your H one. Your H one is Hello fellow founder, and you talk about your exit, but the second paragraph down is this is not a pitch for anything. I have nothing to sell you. I have enough money, so I love that I have enough money, so I promise this is not an intro to my coaching service, paid subscription or anything else. My only goal is to help founders. And so you have a contact page there if folks want to reach out, and what do you want them to reach out about? What typically do people want advice from you about?  Jeff:Yeah, so let me start with the negative response on that, which is the real generic ones I can’t help with. What kind of business should I start those? I try to write, and I’ll need to spruce up my website before this publishes, but I’ll try to write a very basic applies to everyone, answer to a very basic, applies to everyone, question the ones that are useful or people that have a particular situation or problem that I can help with. If someone does business to consumer or they’re trying to open up a market in Asia or something, I can’t help, but I’ve had, I dunno how many calls and this brings me energy, so I’m so happy to do it, which is why I don’t need money. I don’t have a coaching service, I don’t have anything else. It just gives me energy. I’ve been, I think, an authentic ear for the people who are going through it. And that’s where I think I can provide some good in the world from people who can’t make payroll, from people who are thinking about a big partnership, thinking about selling. Their spouse is telling them to get a real job. I talked to a guy whose co-founder committed suicide in their apartment. I’ve talked to people who are in the process of making mistakes that I’ve made. And I think it’s really a relief for a founder to be able to talk to someone who’s been through it and can say, yeah, me too. You’re not alone and it’s going to be okay while not having to secretly pitch me for an investment. I make no investments. No investments in anything. That’s the trade. I’ll not write a check, but I’ll not ask you. I don’t want any shares, warrants, options, nothing. I want nothing.  Rob Walling:And they don’t need to pay you. You don’t charge per hour. You don’t have a product. Yeah, very cool. All right, so that’s retired founder.com if folks want to reach out. In addition, you mentioned to me that you are interested in doing more podcast YouTube videos. So if someone’s listening to this and they feel like Jeff might be a good guest on their show, you can obviously ask him. He’s very open about a lot of stuff. He could dig more into the transaction. There’s a lot more that we could talk about, but due to time we won’t. So feel free to contact Jeff, either DM on Twitter or head to retired founder.com. Jeff, thanks so much for joining me on the show.  Jeff:Thanks for having me, Rob. I really appreciate and enjoy your work. Nice to be in touch with you.  Rob Walling:Thanks so much to Jeff for joining me on this week’s episode of Startups For, the Rest, Of Us. And if you think Jeff’s story was interesting and that he’s knowledgeable, after our conversation on this episode, I asked him if he would be a TinySeed mentor and he accepted. So this is how we’ve built at TinySeed. What I believe is the best mentor network in the world for B2B SaaS companies is finding people who are not the headline name, who have had their name splashed all over everything that we all know. It’s people who have been grinding in the trenches and built an incredible knowledge base and experience, put in the hard work, learned the skills, maybe got a little lucky, maybe it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter how lucky you get if you sell for that amount of money. I really appreciated Jeff’s transparency and him sharing his knowledge. And as I said, he’s now a TinySeed mentor. So that gives you an idea of the types of quality and experience that we’re looking for in that role. Thank you for listening to this episode and every episode.

My name is Rob Walling and I am your host this week and every week on the show today, I welcome back Derek Reimer and we talk through some really interesting listener questions, how to delegate as a perfectionist, how to organize and think about SaaS partnerships and planning your next quarter as a as super small team. We’ll jump into those questions in just a moment. If you haven’t checked out my new course, the SaaS launchpad, head to SaaS launchpad.co. This is the first course I have created in 14 years. It is incredibly in depth. It’s a video course with transcripts and worksheets and quizzes, and it’s all about early stage. It’s all about going from zero to one, going from finding ideas to vetting them, to getting them launched successfully. SaaS launchpad.co if you want to check it out. Now let’s dive in to listener questions. Derek Rimer, thanks for coming back on the show.  Derrick Reimer:Pleasure to be back.  Rob Walling:So I have some really good questions today. Continuing on this topic of more intermediate to advanced questions. The first one is from hello, it’s Ali on Twitter. Ali asks, we’re at $32,000. I’m going to assume that’s MRR and we’ve done it through long hours, endless experimentation and a lot of good luck, hard work, luck and skill. Sounds like. My question is, how should co-founders with perfectionist tendencies delegate work and what qualities should they look for when hiring? And then Ali actually goes on to ask two or three more questions, which we can take in due time. But as someone with perfectionist tendencies, we laugh because you and I are both that way in certain areas. So  Derrick Reimer:That’s the name of our band.  Rob Walling:That is my co-founders with perfectionist Tendencies. Tendencies, just perfectionist tendencies for short, what are we? Like a third wave ska band.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, perfectionist.  Rob Walling:Yeah. No, I think that’s it. You can be the guy. You’re the guy just dancing on stage. I love to dance. Tuba, no drum, major drum major. You’re drum major drum  Derrick Reimer:Sax.  Rob Walling:Alright, and sacks. I forgot that everything’s in B flat people. We have to play it all in B flat. Okay, so back to Ollie’s insightful question, perfectionist tendencies, which I think a lot of founders, not all, but a good chunk of founders become founders because they really want control over things. They don’t like a day job because they’re ordered around and they work with people they don’t want to work with and they can’t hire and fire, but whatever. And I want to control because if I can control everything, it will be better. And oftentimes that’s true, but it doesn’t scale. You can’t run, I say Canton quotes, you can’t run a million dollar 2 million a or SaaS company with just you at some point you have to let some stuff go. So to that point, how do you think about hiring people to do that you’re a perfectionist about and what qualities do you look for?  Derrick Reimer:So I think there’s, as I was thinking this through, there’s kind of two buckets, two different kinds of delegation I think. So there’s the mindset or the task before you of I have some less skilled work that’s not worth spending my valuable founder time on and when I could be working on higher leverage things, so maybe bookkeeping or scraping some data to build a cold email list or even support, which is I think is something that a lot of founders hold on for way too long. So there’s kind of that bucket of things that’s like, okay, my time’s valuable and this stuff is potentially not worth my time. Then there’s the stuff that’s like the business needs certain expertise in order to keep moving forward. And though I want to hold onto this thing, actually I’m not the best person for the job. So then that’s delegating stuff that’s really not in your zone of genius. And a lot of times when you’re just starting out, depending on what your resources are, how much funding you may have or may not have, you just got to roll up your sleeves and do it. But I think that that ends up holding you back at a certain point if you’re just holding on too tightly onto something where it’s not actually in your zone of genius. So for that, it feels like an obvious answer, but it’s like, look for someone better than me at the job, someone who has that particular specialty. So I think about the initial branding for iCal. I did myself and it was fine. And then we came to the point of I feel like this is holding us back in certain ways with being able to really push our marketing forward. And I looked to someone who’s just this amazing kind of brand designer and has just a ton of skills on the aesthetic side of things where I just get a little bit limited. And it was so fun to work with someone who is actually an expertise in their field. So I feel like I don’t know this one, it takes a while to get to the place where you’re comfortable with it, but as soon as you embrace the fact that no, it really is a joy to work with people who are actually better at stuff than you and you get to be a collaborator with them, it’s not that you have to totally offload it and now you have no say ideally if you’re still the founder in the CEO driver seat or whatever, you are still collaborating on important things, but you’re not the bottleneck anymore on holding back that area of the business. Those are some initial rambling thoughts.  Rob Walling:I think it’s a key differentiator you’ve made between delegating things that you really shouldn’t be doing. I would include customer support in that. Now, in the early days, doing customer support is really helpful. As a founder you learn a ton as you transition. I believe I did email support with Drip for three months, four months, and then we brought Andy in to, he was doing part-time stuff, but he obviously is better at customer support than I am. And people say, well, I don’t want to lose touch with my customers. It’s like, yeah, Andy fed me all the feedback. Anything that was real feedback, we like, Ooh, this is coming up, you and I learned about it, you and I fixed it. So I would lump that in. But I like that differentiation of what starting to figure out what is your zone of genius? Because just because you’re a developer, not everyone listens to the show as a developer, but a lot, just because a developer doesn’t necessarily mean that development and or product are your zone of genius, you might find that you’re really good at left brainin marketing as folks like Ruben found out as folks. I found out, I’ve been writing codes since I was eight years old and I loved and I was a developer and I identified as a developer. It turns out I’m pretty good at building audiences and at coming up with educational frameworks that the stair step method and being an entrepreneur is making hard decisions with incomplete information and writing books. And I have this other thing that I’ve found in myself of almost like, I don’t know, it’s marketing, it’s copywriting, it’s whatever, brand building and stuff. So all that said, there are really only what six areas of a SaaS company. There’s product which is deciding what do we build next and how do we build it, how does it work? There’s design, which is obviously the visual aspect of that. There’s engineering, which is building right in the code, keeping things going. There’s marketing, there’s sales, there’s support and there’s success. And then there’s hr, legal and finance. But you should delegate all that. I mean you have to do it. Look on day one, you have to do all those. If you’re a single founder, if there’s two of you, you have to split up those six, seven things I just named. But what you said is exactly right, which is if you’re going to hire, you need to hire someone who’s better at it than you. And that’s something that I really didn’t realize until in the last 10 years.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think that’s what a lot of us, when you put yourself in a position, maybe an artificially elevated position of I know best I started this company and I have the vision for it. And I mean I totally understand this pull to hold on tightly to everything. And I think sometimes that can lead you down a path of like, okay, I just need to find extra hands. I just need extra hands to delegate, to offload some of the stuff that I’m still going to hold on tightly to and own. And I remember when we required, drip was acquired and we joined Lead Pages and we brought on Brian Reed as our first designer. And I never fashioned myself as a graphic designer, but I think I’m a pretty good UI ux designer. But working with Brian definitely opened my eyes to like, okay, here’s somebody who has worked in companies where we need to actually start to scale a design department. And that is a different thing than having the expertise to take something from zero into something that customers love and use to then scale it into systems. So he started working on what’s our design system and it’s not, doesn’t necessarily mean spending a bunch of time working on something that’s not actually moving the product forward. A bunch of internal work. We did very lean on developing our design system so that we weren’t just spending a bunch of time spinning wheels, but he brought this experience on thinking about how do we scale this so that when we bring on more designers, they understand the system and we’re working in a coherent manner. So it’s like, yeah, I mean he had more expertise at that than me and it was really cool to work with someone then who brought that to the table and it was a really fun collaboration. So I think that’s the big word of encouragement here is to recognize that it doesn’t devalue what you bring to the table, but working with a subject matter expert on some of these disciplines is actually really fun. I think when you get used to it. Yeah,  Rob Walling:It is. And you can learn from them. When we were acquired, I was stressing to everyone about, oh my gosh, I have to go work for somebody. You have to go work for this company for a bit of time. And Ruben actually asked me, he said, what can you learn? How can you make this the best it can be? What can you learn? And we got in there and it’s like I had been running marketing for Drip, right? Working with Zach, who’s our junior marketing hire. And I was like, yeah, I’m pretty good. Drip’s growing obviously, so I must be good at it. Hey, I’m really hiring. Hey good marketer. Look at me. And we get in there and I’m like, oh, I don’t know shit about this. We figured it out, but I was not fine. I was middle of the road by the time we got in there. Just people who knew how to execute and like you said, build systems and just be better at it. So I was a perfectionist with every word, every word that was on that website I had written right? I wrote all the copy up till that point and I did want to let it go. I was just tired of having to, for me to write all the copy when I was trying to run this company. But what I realized was people came in and rewrote it and at first I was like, Ooh, that’s not mine. And then I was like, huh, that’s actually a lot better. So that’s the tough part, but it’s tough when you’re bootstrapping and you’re at 5K MRR. It’s like, can you hire someone who’s way better at you in these things? Maybe not. And that becomes the struggle of I start looking, I do start looking in cheaper locales. I say overseas being in the us, but really it could be South America, central America to find someone who is senior and who’s better at me than I am at that thing. And to maybe not give away my zone of genius. I wouldn’t hire someone to host the podcast and be high level strategy for MicroConf and TinySeed to be the face of the brand. You know what I mean? Those things. Those are kind of the things I need to keep doing. So in your SaaS in your company or if you’re a consultant or whatever, you’re listening to you, what are the things that you really need to do without the self-importance of I really need to do everything the best, but really get down to it? Most of us are good at one, maybe two things for you. I would say it’s product. It’s the ability to think of what to build, how to build it, how to elegantly incorporate it in, and then engineering the actual nuts and bolts of writing code and design is a third. I mean your full stack obviously. But to me design is kind of a third discipline, even though you’re very, very good at it. I think you’re actually genius level at the other two and you’re quite good at design. So those are things that you tend to hold onto with Cal.  Derrick Reimer:And I think just in general, this perfectionism quality that a lot of us have is it can be a really helpful inclination what allows you, drives you forward on performing your best work in certain areas. But I also think the blind spot that comes from that is especially early on, you’re talking about when you don’t have a lot of resources to go hire a world-class, fill in the blank, and you have to try to be a little bit more scrappy with bringing in extra hands. I think there is that phase where you just don’t have the luxury of being able to go find an all-star and then it’s an exercise in figuring out what stuff actually matters. And I think I’m still trying to grow in this area, to be honest. It’s a big struggle for me because I tend to think that a lot of things matter a ton, especially as I am, I’m competing on user experience. So all the details have to be on point, but the fact of the matter is you can get by with certain things. Just take for example, like an educational video that you send to a customer that explains how to do something right. My inclination is to want to either not do it or do it at a very, very high degree of execution. And really what matters most is that the customer understands how something works and that knowledge is transferred. And if it’s lacking that extra polish that would come from something that’s from a world class video producer or something, that’s okay in the early days, maybe you want to work to the place where everything you put out is at that atom wa and level of polish, but most of us don’t have just the resources to be able to do that and it’s not going to move the needle in that big of a way. So you need to just convince yourself about what things are really, really important and what stuff you, is it okay to just be good enough on?  Rob Walling:That’s exactly right. That is something that I’ve learned throughout my career and it took me a long time. Well, the first one was learning to just not do some things that seemed important that you just don’t do ’em all together and it doesn’t matter. The second thing is when I can phone it in, and that’s not, it’s do it quickly is really what it is. When can I do an unedited loom? This is like, Hey, I’m rob here, blah, blah, blah, and I kind of mess around, watch this on two x because it’s not great and send it to a customer most of the time, probably if it’s a one-off thing, you know what I mean? It’s like you can just crank on these things and then when to really polish it and when does it matter. And differentiating between those three levels is a skill that I think is very helpful to develop. We’ve actually answered one of Ollie’s later questions, which was how would you decide what to delegate and what to keep? We’ve kind of talked about that zone of genius. Are there things founders should never delegate? And I don’t say never, but certainly there are certain things that if you love doing a man, you’re really good at it and the business needs it. That’s kind of what you want to keep. Your role will change over time is gives you’re a million, 5 million, 10 million, you got to move more into strategy, blah, blah, blah. I would also say something we haven’t brought in is I have this very simple dichotomy of risk versus certainty. There are areas of your business where there’s just a bunch of, I don’t know, we don’t have marketing, we don’t have leads and I don’t really know how to close sales demos and there’s a bunch of uncertainty or risk there. And then there are things like customer support. We get the same 10 questions every day. We have a kb. I know that someone with knowledge of the product can do that. So that’s a certain thing In a lot of instances as your code base matures, not in the first month, but two, three years down the line, there’s a lot of certainty in writing code. Now you may have to spec it out, you may have to say, oh, it’s this feature and we’re going to hit all these. But you have a map in your head of like, I can code this or I can hand it to a developer who’s good and who I know will write high quality code and they can do it. And so that’s how I think about stuff in my businesses is where’s the risk or uncertainty? That’s what the founder should be working on. It is so easy and tantalizing and it’s like a big bowl of ice cream to work on certainty. It makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I’m good stuff. It is entrepreneurial procrastination, unfortunately, if you have any type of money to hire someone, go for the areas of certainty.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think you just touched on this, but it sort of Jason Cohen’s joy, skill, need framework, which has been a really helpful framing for me to think about this. And I mean he’s sort of proven to be the master at reinventing his roles as now he’s gotten his companies to much later stages than a lot of us have. So he’s moved out of CEO into CTO and then into kind of a strategist. And so he’s very good at thinking about this and releasing the reins on control when he recognizes that he needs to reorient himself into the ideal zone. And I think a lot of us can’t necessarily be right in the middle of that joy skill, need Venn diagram because again, resource constraints. But I think if you recognize where you are in that, and I think a lot of makers are like joy and skill. We are very good at building products and we love doing it, but the business probably needs more marketing. I think that’s the story for maybe 90% of indie hackers and people who are come from the angle of developer founder, and maybe you have the resources to bring in marketing help. Maybe you have to roll up your sleeves and do it yourself, but even just being aware that okay, even if you don’t find it that joyful, joyous to do that work, it needs to be done. So you got to force yourself to do that. And maybe there’s, in the course of wearing many hats, maybe you do also spend some time doing the stuff that you really love. You should maybe, I don’t think you should give it all up. You might find yourself burned out and delegate when you can to bring in help so that you don’t feel like you’re just failing at marketing and not getting anywhere. But I think just being cognizant of the traps of focusing only on the stuff that you enjoy and that you’re skilled at, but not missing that key component of what does the business need.  Rob Walling:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results. And longtime listener Chaz y hired a senior developer from lemon.io and said his hire quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used Lemon IO again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. And Ali’s, last question is, would you recommend several people across several marketing channels or finding a generalist? The answer is, it depends. Depends on budget really, and it depends on the stage. But here’s the biggest thing. There’s kind of three ways to structure a marketing department in SaaS. It’s the infinity budget plan, which is I have infinity dollars that I’ve raised from gie, they just keep depositing this in my bank account. Derek, it’s great. I would hire a high level marketing strategist slash project manager and then I would hire five independent, I’m sorry, individual contributors. They could be freelance or contracted or they could be W2, it doesn’t matter. But one is just expert copywriter and one is an expert AdWords and one is an expert Facebook and one is an expert. You get the idea. It’s like each marketing channel that just costs a load of money and so almost none of us can do it. So when I look at the TinySeed companies that are doing seven figures in a RR, I have this list that I keep this quite a few of ’em. Every single one of them, without exception, the founder has figured out enough about marketing or sales or lead gen driving new customers. They have not outsourced that for the start. Now some of them at a certain point get to 500 a million a year, 2 million. They do, they hire ahead of growth, but they already know the engines. The engines are already in place. I don’t know anyone, maybe there’s an exception here or there. So we can bring up who has just hired that out of like, cool, go find out how to find more customers. It’s much like doing sales demos like the founder. You just have to do it if you’re going to do it in the early days. So usually the model is one of the founders says, I’m going to learn marketing or lead gen because the reason I differentiate is marketing I tend to think of as inbound. And then outbound is not marketing that’s outbound. So I’m kind of lead gen. I’m combining two into that term lead gen, but they learn marketing well enough that then they, and they probably start as the ic, the individual contributor. I remember logging into the AdWords console and logging into the Facebook ads console and writing blog posts for seo. Like I did all of that. Am I the best in the world at it? No. Did I do it until we figured out, oh, this kind of works, and then I went and hired freelancers to take over. Yeah, there are some exceptions to this. If you have budget, obviously running ad platforms, LinkedIn, Facebook, AdWords, Instagram, obviously those do have experts that you can hire and are way better than you and they aren’t that expensive. So I would consider doing that from the start. But even to test, but almost everything else, it’s usually the founder being that strategist and then hiring ICS first, the founder doing the IC work and then hiring individual contributors to help out with that as you get budget. Because as marketing works, the company grows and as the company grows, you have more revenue and you take that revenue and you should invest that back in marketing. Usually it’s marketing and sales are the first things that you should be doing as you’re growing SaaS company. You have anything to add to that?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I mean, I think my own story is a little bit of an outlier case in part because I could find, because Corey Haynes was available who’s a very good generalist marketer, founder minded person. So a lot of times people have this type of person on their co-founding team and Corey happened to be available and is a collaborator for me to work with because I was at the time, didn’t have a developer, so I was just building product day and night, but also we were getting it off the ground and trying to do launches and figure out how do we get SEO engines rolling and how do we kind of working through the strategy. So we collaborated together on developing the strategy and it was just helpful to have an extra mind to think about these things. And then he did a lot of the sort of delegation of, okay, we want articles. We’re going to sub these out to a freelancer. And so he was in charge of, or a pool of freelancers, so he was in charge of building the spreadsheet of the keywords and it was all very collaborative between the two of us, but he was just basically in that role of the boots on the ground kind of project managing marketing stuff. And so that worked well for us. I don’t know how many generalist marketers are out there available to do that type of work as a contractor. So at the time I probably  Rob Walling:Almost no one.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, yeah. I mean, I probably wouldn’t have been able to hire full-time a marketer. It perhaps would’ve been too expensive at the time. So  Rob Walling:You have a luxury of a marketer wants to work with you because of who you are and because of the beautiful products you build and they know that you’re going to execute quickly. The zero to one marketing is what kind we talk about. That’s the founder level marketing, trying to figure it out. And Corey Haynes can do that. Agent GIO can do that. Any founder who succeeds can usually do that. I mean, I can pretty much list all of the successful fast-growing companies within TinySeed or MicroConf, like, oh, the founder has some hand in the marketing or sales. So you’re right, you’re the exception. It doesn’t mean that’s where it’s like, it’s not always a never, but in general, pretty 80, 95, 8% of the time, that’s the pattern that I see. So thanks for those questions, Ali. Our thoughts were helpful. Next question comes from Tiago, his ex Twitter handle is WBE Tiago. He says, how do you manage partnerships with other SaaS or products in your industry? What do you look for? What partnering with other SaaS, how do you reach out to them? What are red flags? And I asked him, tell me more what you mean by partnering. And he said, I mean guest posts, integrations, giveaways, joint ventures, that kind of stuff. I wanted you to weigh in on this because Avi, you’ve done a lot, quite a few partnerships and I think some of them have resulted in good results. So I’m curious your thoughts and then obviously I have my own just from my own experience.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I mean I think just in general, these are a lot trickier in practice than they look. I think oftentimes, so many times I think partnerships are fraught with the dynamic of if someone is much larger than you, do they feel like you’re getting more of the benefit than them or vice versa, what do you both have to bring to the table? So early on in Savvy Cal, there was one particular partnership attempt with a company that was related and sort of made sense for us to explore building an integration at a deeper level than just our baseline integrations. And it ended up being a pretty big waste of time in the end because they felt like they were so much larger and ultimately they were kind of afraid to drive too much traffic to us. That felt out of balance. And so I think there’s going into any kind of partnership, it’s important to have a deep understanding of what’s the vision for how you’re actually better together, why bother doing anything at all? Because if there’s not a foundational story that we can all agree on, then these things are going to either quickly or very slowly crop up and kind of taint the whole endeavor. So sometimes it’s getting your product in the hands of their customers helps drive retention or fill in a gap in functionality where they’re losing sales because they can’t provide this thing and your product can fill in that gap. So it’s that question of how do you both win with whatever it is. And it could be as simple as like we’re going to build an integration and email our customers both about that. I mean, those are oftentimes pretty simple, especially if they have an API or you have an API, depending on the direction that the integration needs to go, a lot of times they can be pretty simple and the main benefit is it’s helpful for their customers. Maybe you get a back link from their website on their docs and there’s kind of a good little link together. And other times when it’s deeper, I think the big thing is looking for are they actually willing to invest in this or is it just sort of a transactional sort of thing. I’ve had outreach from larger companies that are almost like putting me through kind of a BDR process where they’re like, you can tell they’re reaching out to a lot of companies asking for integrations because they have some person, random person in their partnerships department who just is working the long tail of trying to get their service integrated with a bunch of other people. And those are not super high value. I don’t have any evidence that their customers actually want to use my product. They just are looking for another backlink and another notch on their list of integrations to be able to say we integrate with thousands of tools. So I think it’s trying to make sure, is there an actual case here? Have you actually heard demand from your customers for something like my product and vice versa, can we develop something meaningful here or is it kind of just this transactional, we’re hoping to get a quick win on some traffic.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that’s a really good way to think about it, to go up one level higher in terms of strategy, I think about integrations and partnerships as kind of the same thing, but an integration involves writing code, so a partnership, let’s just say it’s a JV partnership, joint venture partnership. This is what internet marketers used to do in the early two thousands where it’s like, I have a list. You have a list. Let’s cross promote our course to the other list. It’s free sales, and we can either do a one for one trade of we email without affiliate links, I email my list about yours, you email your list about mine, no affiliate links, or we can do the same thing and do affiliate deals, and that can happen. I did several of those with Hit Tail, which is a long tail SEO keyword tool. You remember Derek? We worked on it.  Derrick Reimer:Oh, yes.  Rob Walling:And I reached out to Rank Trackers. We did not have rank tracking, and I sent 10 emails and I got eight responses of like, absolutely, let’s do this. And what assets did I have? Well, we had however many thousand, I’m trying to even remember what the numbers were, but it was like a thousand customers and a marketing list of 10 or 15,000 maybe at the time. No, it was bigger than that actually, because maybe it was 20,000. And so I would reach out and say, let’s just do one for one emails. Just say, I want to use your rank tracker and then I want to recommend it and use Tail and recommend it, and that’s it. And we did that. Was it a massive flywheel that completely grew the business? No. But was it something that absolutely worked every time we did it? Yes, it would drive dozens of new customers. It would drive hundreds if not a thousand or 2000 of MRR if the list was big enough. So that’s a joint venture where you don’t have to write any code. You’re literally writing marketing copy. And then in integration, to your point, I see there’s integrations that you do for your customers. You integrate with Stripe because everyone wants you to integrate with Stripe. Stripe’s not going to promote you, PayPal’s not going to promote you. They may not even list you in their lab market, but you do it for your customers. Then there’s integrations you do for integration marketing, which is, remember with Drip, we integrated with Send, and we had 35 integrations, so I can’t remember them, but they were lesser known, even Gumroad at the time. We probably integrated with them in 2013 or 14. They were around, but they were not as known as they’re today. We integrated with them because our customers were asking, they were like, oh, I use Sendell, I use Gumroad. But also I approached them and I said, I want to integrate with you. We’re getting requests from customers. Here’s a screenshot of an email. Here’s things we can offer. We can publish a blog post. We can email our email list of, it’s probably by that time, 20, 25,000. We can post a tweet, we can write a knowledge based article. We can mention your company and app. We can host a webinar if you want. And so I would offer all that up and say, what can you reciprocate with? And whatever they could, we would just one for one those things. So if they could only do a blog post in a tweet, we did a blog post in a tweet, and if they said, you know what? This isn’t a fit. We can’t do it. I would seriously debate whether to do it to the integration if I was doing it more for marketing purposes. By the way, the whole list I just read is from the SaaS Playbook, page 97. If you want to know all the things that we used to do, I’ll tell you, the SaaS Playbook’s a great reference for me so that I remember these. You know what I mean? I don’t remember that list off the top of my head. So that’s how I think about it. I mean, you and I are definitely on the same page in terms of be cautious with just building things, thinking that it’s going to be promoted. I would get a commitment, I’ll say a verbal commit. It was in an email. This is what we’re going to do. What can you do? This is what we’re going to do back. So I had something in writing in case a product manager or a marketing manager switch things up later. I think that’s it. Oh, I guess Tiago asked how do you reach out to them? I mean, with Hit Tail, I did a bunch of cold email with Drip. It was a lot of warm network stuff as Drip became a brand, people knew it and it was easy to reach out and say, Hey, I’m the co-founder of Drip, and we want to do this. And what’s the other thing, Derek, going to events, going to MicroConf. There are a lot of people there at a MicroConf business software, even a bigger SaaS event. This is why I say build your network, not your audience. That network is so much more valuable than 10,000 people on X Twitter following you having five people that you can integrate with or co-promote or get in front of their audience is worth five times, 10 times the value of a social media following.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think that’s the majority of, well, we have our integrations with the big players, but the smaller players that we integrate with, a lot of that is came from some degree of warm connection to the point where I could reach out, ping them and DM them or email them and make the case like you talked about, we’re hearing a lot of customers mention wanting to integrate our two products together. Here’s what we’re seeing. Are you guys seeing anything similar? And just start the discussion on have you heard anything? Oh, that’s interesting. You want to do a test? We get the ball rolling on conversation for good reason and not just be cold outreach  Rob Walling:To your point. And that’s something that didn’t use to happen. So if it’s happening to you now where you’re like, oh boy, I’m in a funnel, this is because marketers ruin everything. That’s exactly why. Our last question for the day was a question that was posted on a YouTube video from YouTube username and Derek Ddu, Plessy two 15, and I don’t remember what video was on, but the question is I would love a follow up to this episode on how you prioritize your Q3 or any quarter. So obviously building a SaaS versus what I do these days is different, but the question still applies. So I’m going to kick it over to you first. Derek Kremer, how do you plan for your quarter of Savvy Cal?  Derrick Reimer:Oh, yeah. There’s no notion of quarterly planning in my flow, and I think that’s probably the case for a lot. Same for me, for a lot of startups,  Rob Walling:Part of our biggest strength is that we are so nimble and can move so quickly, and frankly, 90 days in the life of a startup is like a year in the life of a big company. So trying to think of now, I don’t know, I’m going to be responding to customer inquiries and things as the market shifting. How can I move really fast? And so planning a quarter ahead would be, that’s just anathema to what you’re doing until you’re at, I don’t know, I don’t want 5 million, 10 million. When you have a bigger team, that’s when planning needs to happen. You got to get a bunch of departments on board and we’re going to launch this feature. So we need sales to learn about the feature, and we need support to know how to support the feature. We need success to know how to success the feature, and we need marketing to know how to market the feature. You know what I mean? That’s when you need quarterly planning. You can’t just come with a feature and say, Hey, we’re pushing this live tomorrow. That starts breaking things. So there’s a certain point at 2030 employees maybe where you need that. But today, so how do you do it? How far ahead do you plan?  Derrick Reimer:, I mean we generally have a sense for what the next four to six weeks looks like. I’m not a religious follower of Shape Up. I think that’s a pretty popular methodology from the Basecamp folks that people have latched onto as sort of a way to budget your time as a team and say, what are we going to? Let’s fix the time budget and then get done whatever we can on what we set out to do and flex the scope as needed. And I think that’s kind of generally, folks have coalesced around that as a good way to shape your work. And I think it scales down to pretty early stage as well. You might want to keep the cycle a little shorter. Six weeks feels long for super early stage, but when you get to a place of product maturity where you’re really just kind of incrementally improving it, I’ve seen that be a pretty helpful time range. And yeah, the goal there is to try to say, we’re going to build this thing and we’re going to build whatever version of it we can get done within our time constraints so that you don’t let projects just run away on you.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it depends on the stage and the super early stage. You and I would plan a day or two ahead. I mean, there were some features that took a week or whatever, and it’s like, all right, we’re going to plan for that. But we would shift pretty frequently when it was two or three of us because we could, and then it started being like, well, let’s do one to two weeks out. And one to two weeks was fairly locked in, although we would sometimes pivot of like, oh my gosh, there’s a huge opportunity here. But then what happens is, in my head, I kind of knew what two to four, two to six weeks was, but it was fuzzier. It was like, well, we do when we get there, but I kind of have an idea. And then as your code base matures, as your marketing matures, just your whole company matures. You hit 10, 20, 30 K, maybe 50 KMRR, that timeframe just slipped, not slips, but it moves out a bit. Like you’re saying you’re now at about four to six weeks of being more in focus, and I bet, but I bet still if I were to say, all right, so what are you going to do from six to 12 weeks? You have a fuzzy idea. You have a general idea. You’re not going to lock in and be like, oh, it’s this and that, but you kind of know, but once you get there, you’re then going to plan that far out.  Derrick Reimer:I wonder, have you seen, because I know the notion of quarters is very normative in sales in the realm of sales, sales organizations often think in terms of quarters, probably even more so than product development teams. But I wonder, do you have a sense of when does that normally kick in? Is it 20 to 30 team size ish, or when do sales teams need to start running on quarters basically?  Rob Walling:I don’t actually know. So sales team specifically, I don’t know, and obviously big Salesforce and these huge companies that have this Slack and all that, have these big sales teams run like that? Even if you were to ask me why do they do that? I have a guess. Oh, you have a deadline and your salespeople motivated by this and that, and maybe the commission’s paid quarterly, but I don’t actually know, so I’d be curious to get someone on the podcast, to be honest, a Jen Abel or a Matt Ock or someone else who really knows sales and said, why is that? Is it just because that’s how you’ve always done it? Is it, I mean, here’s something man, A friend of mine works at Intel and has, we both graduated college at the same time and he got a job and has worked at the same company the whole time, and I’m on my 23rd job, not literally, but close. Anyways, from the time he started, he would say, yeah, we’re doing our quarterly blah in the engineering department. They’re designing chips that are fabricated. You imagine the pipeline of that, the waterfall, this nature of that where it’s like You have to lock it in, you have to freeze this, and you put it’s in silicon and then it’s blah, blah, blah. So they did quarterly stuff and I was kind of like, why do you do that? And he’s like, well, that’s just how the company operates. And it does to me feel like an older school thing coming from that of Intel. But I also think you have to get people on a cadence of some kind, otherwise you’re just flailing around. Like we said, if you have six, seven departments and each department is five to 50 to a hundred people, obviously Intel’s bigger than that, but in a startup you got to have some type of cadence to get everybody on. This is the group of things that we’re going to do in each department during this quarter.  Derrick Reimer:I would venture to guess that, again, speaking a little bit from ignorance here, but that product teams, even when you’re 10, 20, $50 million company, I’m not convinced that a product development team should ever lock themselves into something that rigid, no, maybe sales. Maybe sales, but depending on when you bring in the adult supervision and people who know what they’re doing from large company sales orgs, maybe that’s the right way. But I would be very leery about ever of trying to apply that to a product development cycle.  Rob Walling:And I totally agree with that. And those are the companies where we eat their lunch as right, those are the companies. When you start moving my quarter by half a year on product development, no, good night. That’s when we’re going to demolish. You remember it? Was it Infusionsoft? They’re now named Keap. I thought they did one release a year and we were  Derrick Reimer:Pushing code, some kind of version thing, applied SaaS, which is like why  Rob Walling:Old school? And it was an old school mentality, and that’s not how you win in the market today, given how competitive it is. Awesome, man. Well, thanks so much again for joining me. Folks, want to follow you on X Twitter? You are Derek Reimer, and if they want to use the best scheduling link on the internet savvy cal.com. There it is. Thanks again, man. Thanks. Thanks again to Derek Rimer for joining me on the show. He’ll be back again in another month or two. If you enjoyed this episode, it’d be amazing to get a five star review in Apple podcasts or Google whatever they’re calling it these days. A thumbs up on YouTube or a like question mark plus thumbs up, something in Spotify. I don’t know how Spotify does if you’re listening to Spotify, look around to see if there’s a heart, but it’s great to have you here this week and every week, I’m Rob Walling signing off from episode 731. Well, hello, listener. You’ve stumbled upon our secret track, if you remember the track, endless nameless from Nirvana’s. Nevermind. That’s what you’re about to hear, except that was just a metaphor. I hope you picked up on that. Mr. Derek Rimer, I have questions for you. Oh boy. These are questions that I asked chat GPT to generate for me. My prompt was what are five intermediate level questions to evaluate a software developer’s understanding of Ruby on Rails? The first question, just so everybody knows, Derek has no idea what these questions are coming, and to be honest, I’m a little concerned. The answers might not be right. I don’t know. GBT give me questions and answers, so we’ll see. I’ll compare what you say to chat. Alright. First is, what are concerns in Rails and how do you use them to refactor an organized code?  Derrick Reimer:Okay, a concern in Rails, and this is funny too because my Rails knowledge is about five years outdated, so well boy. But I think a concern is basically a mix in, it’s a way to abstract some logic into a separate, my terminology is all messed up. I’ve been in functional land. It’s like a separate, it’s not a class. Is it a module? Do you have modules in Ruby? I think it’s a module. Great.  Rob Walling:I love this. Just so everyone knows, Derek wrote tens of thousands of lines of Ruby on Rails code for Drip, the entire big monolith written in Rails. So you had a decade of rail, you had a lot of years in Rails, but it’s funny how quick, like you said, it’s five years old and you’ve replaced a bunch of that knowledge with, is it Elixir Phoenix? Is that  Derrick Reimer:Basically, yeah, so it’s more like functional paradigms. I haven’t written object oriented code in a while. It was funny, I was doing a podcast episode with Ben Ornstein recently who was also a Ruby Rails expert back in the day. And I was trying to explain how something would work in Ruby Land, but I was using all the wrong names for the active record accessories. I was just so used to the naming conventions from Elixir,  Rob Walling:You recoded it. So in the early days when I was becoming a professional developer, meaning getting paid for it, I was a full-time employee of a dev shop. And so every project was a different language, and so it was like PHP, it was original active server pages before.net. There was ColdFusion. I learned Pearl this dates, it was 20, 24 years ago. But I rolled through ’em all and I remember being like, all right, I’m not great at any of these, but at least I had a big swath of it. Then at a certain point I went where the money was, which is.net, and I dove deep, deep, deep into net, and then I was 5, 6, 7 years into that, and the pay rates were great, but when I tried to then come back to anything to PHPI was like, I just can’t. The paradigms are so different. You have to unlearn it, and that’s where it’s tough. Totally.  Speaker 3:Yep.  Rob Walling:It’s good that I come prepared then, because I also asked no joke, Chad, GBT, what are five intermediate level elixir Phoenix questions? I did this on purpose, so let’s see if these are easier. We’ll just skip the rails one. We don’t have to do five. Let’s do a couple. First is  Derrick Reimer:Wait on the concerns. Was I right? What did Chad GT say?  Rob Walling:Actually didn’t say, it just said, this question tests their knowledge of code organization and how to keep their models and controllers clean and maintainable.  Speaker 3:Okay.  Rob Walling:So maybe someone can tweet us XX, Twitter us at Derek Reimer at Rob Walling and let us know, Hey, was Derek right? I’m guessing you’re right. That’s going to be my, alright. How does the Phoenix framework handle real-time communication? Explain the role of channels and presence in Phoenix?  Derrick Reimer:Ooh, yes. So this is actually one of the cool benefits of Elixir because it’s built on Erling, which has all of this very realtime capabilities built into it because it was built by Ericsson back in the day for running text message infrastructure. So think of all of these gazillions of processes and need to be running, and they’re all in parallel and they don’t necessarily need to affect each other. So it’s just designed inherently with that in mind of many, many processes that shouldn’t crash each other. And this works really well for web socket’s use cases where you have a bunch of people potentially on your site and you want to keep an open channel via web sockets to be able to stream data back and forth over a channel. So channels are the mechanism that Phoenix has for basically opening web socket connections and then sending data up and down that pipe instead of going through old school HTP requests, which are a little bit slower. And then the presence feature. This is actually a tricky computer science problem to solve when you’re active on a browser window and you want to show that that person is actually present there. Keeping that state synchronized with the server is kind of tricky and you just get that for free from sockets. So yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that’s correct because once again, I said, here’s the problem. I asked Chad JPT for questions that I liked for an interview. It didn’t give me the answer. It just says what each question will test. So yes, correct. Derek ding,  Derrick Reimer:Am I hired?  Rob Walling:You’re hired. These are the questions. We never ask these questions. Remember in interviews or like, no. Do you have a take home test or we can look at some of your code,  Derrick Reimer:Right? Yeah, yeah. Explaining how a web request works.  Rob Walling:Yes, exactly. What is H-T-T-P-S? Alright, last one. What are gen servers in Elixir, GEN servers in Elixir and how would you use them in a Phoenix application?  Derrick Reimer:Yes. So gen servers, this is kind of hearkens back to that fundamental architecture I was just talking about, but basically it’s a way to manage state in an elixir application. And it’s a little bit quirky. This is kind of more in the advanced principles of Elixir that a lot of new elixir developers don’t even necessarily have to learn about in order to get started with it. But if you start peeling back the layers on how Phoenix works and then how to do certain tricky things that involve, you have this centralized state and you need to make calls to it or just either fetch, fetch data out of that state or just make a mutation call or something. And it’s like the shared state that’s shared across all the processes that might be running in an elixir application. So we use these as an example, like this cool little subsystem where we have to throttle how many requests we make to the Microsoft API. Like they don’t allow more than five simultaneous requests at a time to any given API token. And this is actually a pretty difficult problem to solve in a distributed system, but using a gen server, we can basically spin up a pool of threads, sort and these threads service requests. And if you get 10 coming in at the same time, they kind of line up in the pool and you can control concurrency. So that’s just one example of how you can use gen servers to help out.  Rob Walling:I love that you’re giving me really serious complete answers. It’s just that I’m like, wow, do you really know your, of course you do. And you’re taking this serious, it’s great. It’s great. So anyone listening, I’m trying to get hired. Here you are. I really need a gig, man. Alright, last question In Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition, what is Hunter’s Mark? So just so for context, Derek has played a, well, it’s a seventh level ranger now named Ford, Ford Ranger, and you have played this ranger for I believe, five years now. I think the first game was in late 2019 that we played five years Hunter’s. Mark is a critical key component of a ranger. So Derek, what does hunter’s mark do?  Derrick Reimer:Oh boy. Okay. I think it’s a spell right and it allows me to mark an opponent and when I do that, I gain some sort of advantage on attacks. I don’t remember what that advantage is.  Rob Walling:You gain extra damage.  Derrick Reimer:Extra damage.  Rob Walling:There we go. Yep. So it’s not technically advantage on attack. That would mean like 2D 20, you take the high one, but once you hit, you get an extra D six.  Derrick Reimer:Lowercase a advantage.  Rob Walling:Exactly.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I talk through lessons that I’ve learned investing in more than 170 companies, specifically through my startup accelerator TinySeed. And if you’re a B2B SaaS founder who’s looking for the right amount of money, mentorship, community advice for me and our amazing mentors, you can head to TinySeed dot com slash apply. Applications are open right now for about the next two weeks, and I’d love to see you apply. Now between TinySeed and mine and Sherry’s personal investments, we are over 190 companies, but I wanted to limit the percentages, the numbers, the takeaways to only those where TinySeed has written a check in the past. I guess the first check was written about five years ago, and so that gives us a pretty tight timeframe and a more cohesive decision-making approach because we’ve been much more deliberate about the types of businesses that we fund. So today’s episode is stemmed from a question I got in a private slack group by man where someone said, you’re basically five years, we’re six years from the announcement of TinySeed almost, but we are just over five years from the first check being written. And he asked, are there any patterns or takeaways that you’re noticing across these 170 plus companies? And that’s what I’m going to share today. Now, I want to make a note. I have almost two dozen of these takeaways and that’s too long for a podcast episode. It would run well over an hour. So what I did is I split off six of them and I put them in a YouTube video on the microcom channel, and it has a name similar to this. It probably just came out a couple days ago, and it’s six things that I’ve learned investing in more than 170 companies over five years, something like that. So if you head to microcomp.com/youtube, it should be one of the last couple videos published, or you can look in the show notes of this podcast and click through directly to that video. If you want to get the other takeaways that I didn’t include in this podcast. I am going to list these in no particular order. They just came to me in this order as I was trying to think of what are the patterns that we’ve seen. First one is the survivability of B2B SaaS and maybe specifically within our portfolio because obviously we are pretty picky, pretty cosy about the companies we let in, but broader than that B2B SaaS in general, once you get a little bit of traction, it doesn’t fail very often. So more than 170 investments, approximately 2% of those have been written off, have shut down, not sold, and basically moved on to their next act. So very, very small, what I’d call a failure rate, much, much smaller than you would see in a traditional more risky venture fund. Now, I want to couch this. It’s still early. We funded, I don’t know, approximately 45 companies in the past 12 months. And so obviously the failure rate of those would be much lower because they haven’t had time to fail. So I don’t want to act like for eternity for the next 10 20 years, there’s going to be a 2% failure rate, but we did start writing checks five years ago, and even among those companies, a failure rate is still extremely low. The other number that I found interesting, and I just confirmed these in our as of this morning, is that 4% of TinySeed companies have exited, meaning sold for enough cash that TinySeed at least got our money back. And in some cases, as you’ve heard with Iran GRE’s exit on this podcast, we received many, many times our money back, but 4% have exited, 2% have been written off. So there’s still a lot of companies in play, and as I said before, it’s still early. I mean, we are in the first inning in terms of B2B SaaS taking five years when a traditional startup might take two years because the long slow SaaS ramp of death just takes a long time for things to unfold. Now, my second takeaway is just how valuable SaaS is. You’ve heard me say this on this show where I talk about if you’re over say 2 million in annual recurring revenue and you’re still growing at 40, 50% a year, whatever it is, you can sell at a four to seven x multiple. And so this is all loose numbers. Please don’t I get quoted on Twitter saying this stuff, but I’m just trying to give you a general idea, but let’s say a five x multiple. So if I add 1000 MRR to my company this month, that is 12 KARR multiply that times a five x multiple if I were to sell it, and I’m adding $60,000 in theory to my net worth every single month that I had one K of MRR. So now think about adding 5K of MRR, which many, many tiny C companies are doing 5K times 12 is 60 times five is $300,000 to the value of that company. So I’ve been talking about how valuable SaaS is for many, many years. There’s a reason that I began focusing on SaaS, what 12 was it? 12, 13 years ago? And part of it’s the recurring revenue, part of it’s the cheat codes, the net negative churn, but a big part of it is it’s just really, really valuable and that value can be seen in the profits you take out or it can be seen in the exits. So in our coined this term that I really like, it’s called the TinySeed millionaire rate. And what it is is of all the companies that are no longer in operation, so this includes those that have sold and those that have been written off that have shut down of all of those. So I told you before, it’s 4% exits, 2% written off. So 6% of those companies, 43% of the founders are now millionaires. Let that sink in for a minute. I’m not saying 43% of the exited companies made the founders millionaires. I’m saying 43% of all companies that are no longer autonomously operating, meaning they’ve either sold or they’ve shut down, 43% of those founders are now millionaires. Now, that doesn’t mean TinySeed one in all of those exits because imagine if we invest at for round numbers, let’s say TinySeed invest at a million dollar valuation or 1.2, whatever it is, and someone sells their company for $2 million and they’re a single founder, they are now a millionaire and TinySeed received whatever it is, not quite two x back on our money. That’s not a home run for us as an investment fund investing in bootstrapped SaaS, we do have to return a lot more than two X to our investors or a bit more than two x. And given that some companies will fail, we obviously need higher returns, but that doesn’t discount the fact that the TinySeed millionaire rate is 43%. If you’ve known me for any length of time, you know me as someone who is truly out to help raise the tide, help raise all boats, obviously with TinySeed, with MicroConf, it’s a for-profit entity. Everything I do makes money, but I’m genuinely here to help people and it brings me no end to joy to know that that many individuals join TinySeed received are mentorship, our advice, our investment, and are now millionaires and they can move on to their next act. I’m sure someone in the audit is saying, oh, a million bucks isn’t what it used to. And it’s like, I get it. They can’t live for the rest of their life on that. But I would say that if this is your first startup or if you don’t already have a million dollars in your bank account, that a million dollars is absolutely life changing money. It’s not never have to work again, money, but it does change your life. It changes the way that you can think about the financial safety of yourself and your family. And every time I think about this number, I smile ear to ear, I’m just so happy the TinySeed is having this impact. People ask me, why do you still do what you do? You could write off into the sunset or you could just write books or you could just record podcasts. This is why, this is exactly why I still record 52 episodes of this a year, 26 YouTube videos, why I’m kind of on track to ship a book every 18 to 24 months because I love doing things that have an impact on people. And to me, while the end goal of everything is not wealth, it’s not all about money. This is changing people’s lives and I’m here for it. The third learning is something I mentioned on this podcast. It was a prediction for this year, and it’s that vertical and orthogonal SaaS appear to have fewer headwinds than horizontal SaaS. You know what horizontal is? It’s like competing against MailChimp where it’s every SMB, every business in the entire country can use it. Versus vertical is where you build MailChimp for realtors, for example, and orthogonal is if you were to build a piece of software that focuses on a specific role or title at a company. So applicant tracking systems, for example, target HR directors, so that’s orthogonal, vertical and have their own because they’re niche, right? The idea is that when we think of niche, we think of vertical only. And so I’ve started using this term orthogonal to describe this other way to niche in to slice it. And what we’re seeing is in general, horizontal companies are competing with big venture funded incumbents, really successful folks where there’s a lot of money in the space and it’s hard to differentiate, and you don’t really know who your ideal customer profile is. You kind of have an idea, but you don’t know exactly where to find them. There’s no in-person event you can afford to go to. There’s no ad targeting say on Facebook or Instagram where you’re targeting by demographics and psychographics that will work for horizontal. I shouldn’t say there isn’t any, but it’s very, very hard to do. Versus if you know exactly who your customer is, whether it’s this type of business or this role at a company, it is easier to do cold outreach and ads and just all the marketing approaches become easier. And you don’t have to be the best marketer in the world, you just have to be the best marketer in your niche. And that’s the difference that we see. And so I’m not going to go through exact numbers here. Obviously we don’t give out our performance numbers in public, but in general, the trend is that we do see vertical and orthogonal SaaS companies not only growing faster, they tend to have lower churn. Honestly, if they’re doing well in these spaces, there are net negative churn and it’s still early, but it does seem like the exit multiples are higher because there is more appetite from acquirers, from strategics and private equity to go after these niche plays, presumably because they also know their numbers, they know how hard it is to market, and they know what negative churn can do for a business. And so with all that in mind, the metrics are better, blah, blah, blah. So it’s still early. And here’s the thing. I know someone on the internet is going to come and post, but that’s not true across all 10,000 SaaS companies. Look, my one counter example is going to try to disprove up. I’m not trying to state a physical law like gravity in this podcast. What I’m doing is I’m looking at trends across things that we are seeing. These are not statements of fact. I’m not saying that every horizontal product TinySeed has is not growing, is nothing like that. It is trends, it’s numbers, it’s bell curves. So yes, you can do your post and say, I’m a horizontal, and look, I have net negative turn. Great. I ran a relatively horizontal play called Drip, and that had net negative turn too. So that was a great business. So I’m not saying don’t start horizontal either. I’m just telling you vertical and orthogonal. There’s some real advantages to doing that. Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates, and they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener. Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with lemon.io. The machine learning engineer, they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results and longtime listener, Chaz Yun hired a senior developer from Lemon Do io and said his hire quote, definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations. Chaz said he definitely used lemon.io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer to learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. Takeaway number four is we’ve done some, it’s really back of the napkin surveys, show of hands where I’ve said, okay, the original thesis of TinySeed was some people will want to grow quickly, be ambitious and sell for some number. They have in mind 10, 15, 20 million or more as we’ve seen, versus run a company for years, decades and take out profits. What we didn’t know is what the breakdown would be. Is it 50 50 to more people want to take up profits? With my show of hands surveys that I’ve done in several TinySeed Zooms, it appears that it’s about 15%, maybe 20 that want to grow a company for the longterm and take out profits. So it is the, call it the super majority that do want to have that big exit. And I think there are reasons for this, right? We are choosing for more ambitious founders. Like if you want to be a lifestyle bootstrapper and truly run a 10, 20, $30,000 a month company and pull it all out, that’s great, but the numbers don’t work for TinySeed to invest in you. And so I do think a much bigger chunk of those folks, whether you call, I call ’em lifestyle, you could call ’em indie hackers, although I think that is actually a different definition, but you get the idea those folks really do want a lifestyle business, and that’s great. I’ve had some of those, but the idea of joining TinySeed and taking funding and then wanting to do that is obviously a super minority of folks. I do think there’s some selection bias in that for sure. And I also think that when people hear me do this analysis where I went through the whole one K goes to 12 KARR times five is 60 grand, and someone puts a check in front of you that you’re like, I don’t really want to sell. And they’re like, cool, here’s your relatively early stage business and here’s $3 million. Suddenly things really shift. Things really shift. I remember the first time I saw a seven figure number written down in an email for a potential acquirer to acquire one of my companies, and I was like, this is it. If I say yes to this, I am set for a very, very long time, and this will be absolutely life changing. I remember almost being in a weird, it’s not euphoric state, but it’s hair stands up on the back of your neck and kind of lose time and even kind of can hear ringing in your ear. It was that. I was like, whoa. I was so shocked how in theory I had been thinking, oh yeah, if we sell this company someday, of course it’ll sell for a lot. But the moment that I saw that number, it changed everything. I was like, that’s real. That could really be cash in my bank account. And I think that as folks think about that, especially if you are either a first time founder or a founder who’s never had a big exit who has $50,000 in their bank account and a couple hundred grand a retirement account, and you realize that, yeah, maybe I could see this for the long term. Maybe I could grow this company for 10 years, but if I sell now, I’m set for life and I can work on whatever I want forever. The calculus really changes. So whatever way you choose, if you’re listening to this, maybe you’re thinking about, I want to be able to retire for three to six months, as most entrepreneurs do before they get back in the game, or you want to run it for the longterm, that’s okay. I’m just calling out some patterns that I’m seeing with our companies. The fifth takeaway is I looked at only our seven and eight figure a RR companies. So if companies doing millions or north of 10 million in annual recurring revenue, and I found that the founder count for these types of companies are very close to being in line with all the founders across the ecosystem from the state of independent SaaS reports. So in this example, 53% of seven and eight figure TinySeed companies are single founders, 33% are two founders, 14% have three or more founders. And just to compare again, the successful TinySeed companies, 53% are single founders and in the broader state of independence, SaaS, MicroConf, startups, the rest of us ecosystem, 51% are solar founders. So 53 versus 51 with two founders, it’s 33 versus 34, and with three or more founders, it’s 14 versus about 15 and a half. So the route, why do I bring this up then? Well, I don’t think founder count, at least in this analysis, has that much of a difference on success. I know that growth numbers in the state of independent SaaS show that for some reason there’s an anomaly with three founder companies. I’m still curious to figure out why that is, but I find it fun to often compare to the broader ecosystem with this much smaller and tighter dataset that we have. My sixth learning, really it’s just a thing to share, is that we have had to turn down many deals where we have made offers or we’re about to make offers, but their cap tables were ruined. So an example of this is founder left and took their equity and whether they own a third or half the company, they didn’t have vesting in place. And now the company is kind of unfundable. If you come to us and we’re typically the first money into a company and the founders own less than 70%, that’s not a good sign. And sometimes we are the second money in. So there are exceptions to that, but certainly you want the founders to own 80%, 70 to 80% and up. And so we’ve seen companies where again, there’s one or two founders left and they own like 50% of the equity and they can’t raise funding in the future. They’re basically working to put money in someone else’s pocket. It’s just a really bad scene. The other thing we’ve seen is that there are some really sharky investors out there that give extremely low valuations, or they have these exploding terms where if you raise before paying them back, then suddenly they own three times the equity that their original document said. And these investment terms can make the company uninvestible unfortunate, but we’ve especially seen it in Europe where an angel will invest at, I dunno, I’m trying to think of an example. There was $50,000 check for 25% of the company, so they invested a $200,000 valuation and that it’s just rough. So now you have this investor who’s not doing anything, not providing a value add, and it’s on the cusp for us of like, Ooh, would we be willing to do that? But realistically, I’m just giving you examples of ways that it’s easy to torture cap table. Be careful. We are less picky, I would say, than bigger venture funds if they see that, they just walk away. So with your ownership percentages, which is what I’m referring to with cap table, you just want to be careful with that. I’ve been shocked at the number that we have seen, and it’s common enough that we ask for the cap table after the first round. If we do a verbal interview and then you go to the second round, we just say, give us a spreadsheet with your cap table. And probably half the cases, I have a question about it, who is this person? What did they contribute? If someone owns 10%, 12% of your company, I’m always like, how did this happen? It also shows a judgment thing. If someone’s like, oh, they helped us a few years back and they did some design work and gave us some advice, and so they got 12% of your company. Like that to me shows a questionable judgment is maybe a strong, maybe a lack of knowledge of the space of how things work, but it’s at least something that we have to dig into to be sure that you don’t make that mistake in the future. A next thing that we’ve seen is subsequent fundraising. So when you join TinySeed, you do not commit to raising additional funds. You just keep the option to do so if, if it makes sense for you. And within the first few years, it was about a third of our companies went on to raise additional funding after the 2022 crash where funding valuations hit 10 year lows and money is just not as easily accessible. I think it’s probably closer to about a quarter, like 25% of TinySeed companies, and this is not, you have to discount the prior year that we’ve invested. Like the most recent year, probably zero to a handful of those companies have even thought about fundraising because they still have the TinySeed money, they’re in the batch year. But we look at anybody who’s a year or 18 months prior to now, what percentage and ballpark. I would say it’s around that one In four mark, we had a company apply with six co-founders. That was an interesting one. They had a lot of products were very scattered and we weren’t able to fund them. Can you imagine? I mean, none of them owned more than 16% of the company and making decisions would be very, very challenging. So that was a red flag of frankly, decision making. When we got into that, then we saw a company apply with zero founders. There was actually one founder of course working on it, but they owned 25% of this early stage company. So I am kind of like, are they really a founder when they are basically working for someone else? To me, that feels like a nice equity grant to an employee. He called himself a founder, but in essence, this is one of those cap tables that we could not fund because a founder working for 25% equity, it just doesn’t make sense. Alright, to wrap things up, the most common topics that I advise on the people pull me into one-on-one conversations during my office hours are the following four things. Number one, raising prices or fixing, changing, correcting pricing. It’s not always about raising sometimes the value metrics off. Sometimes they just don’t feel right about the pricing, so we talk through it. The second is, I’m at a plateau or I’m about to hit a plateau. How do I break through it? And those are the conversations that have fueled this mythical doc that I’ve put together, which is just a bulleted list of all the plateau reasons that I know of with B2B SaaS that someday I’ll figure out a way to package it up in a way that’s actually helpful. But plateaus are a common thing. Someone wrote into this podcast I believe, and said, I heard the most bootstrap SaaS companies plateau at 20 or 30 K. Why is that? And the answer is, that’s not true. It’s not that most do. I see SaaS companies plateauing early because they don’t have product-market fit. I see them plateauing at 20 or 30 K because they only have one marketing approach and the top of funnel is her churn is too high, and I see them plateauing it a million a RR because their churn is too high or they’ve tapped out the market or there’s all these reasons and then they can plateau at 3 million because competitors, blah, blah, blah. So lots of different reasons for plateauing and it is a very common topic of conversation. The third one unfortunately, is co-founder disputes where one co-founder is living, wants to leave, thinks the other should leave, is asking for advice about a buyout or should they just walk away? Should they give some equity back? It gets really complicated. It is like a divorce because folks have worked together, have been friends, have built and started something that is valuable, sometimes not valuable enough. If it was worth $20 million, then maybe you sell it and split the money. But if it’s worth half a million or a million and you’ve spent years working on it, do you really want to liquidate that to the what’s going to be the lowest bidder because you’re not going to get a great price for it and distribute a few hundred thousand dollars to each person that they get taxed on. It is tough. So I don’t mediate co-founder disputes per se. I’m not a mediator. We do have folks that we recommend our founders talk to if they need that, but I definitely am someone that people talk to about advice. Hey, here’s going on. How should I think about it? What are my options? That’s usually the big one is what are my or our options in this case? And of course, now I have a whole laundry list of options when these things come up. And the fourth one that folks get my advice on is raising funding or selling a company. And usually it’s not like, how do I raise funding? How should I think about this? Should I raise funding or sell the company? There are questions then about what are next steps and how should I think about it? What are typical valuations? All of that. But as you can see, I get brought in at big strategic points. Now, I also get brought in, I got brought in for some great just nitpicky questions the other day of per seat licensing advice on how to optimize a marketing channel, what marketing, let’s brainstorm marketing channels to go after next. But if I’m grouping them, it really is those four that I mentioned. As a reminder, I have six more learnings that I did not mention in this episode that I mentioned over on the YouTube channel. You can click the link in the show notes or go to MicroConf dot com slash YouTube and look for a video of approximately the same title as this episode. And another reminder, if you are a SaaS founder and you want the right amount of funding advice, mentorship community TinySeed dot com slash apply.

I’m Rob Walling, and this week I talk to Eran Galperin, the founder of Gymdesk, about how he bootstrapped and frankly mostly bootstrapped Gymdesk to a more than $32.5 million exit. It really is an incredible story of Eran launching this product on the side and working for years, nights, and weekends until it clicked. And this is a good example of if he had launched it and expected it to just work in a month or three months and was launching 10 things, Gymdesk would not be where it is today. It was the sheer focus and the relentless execution and showing up night after night, weekend after weekend until he could quit his day job that got Gymdesk to such an incredible life-changing generational wealth-generating opportunity. I sometimes have TinySeed founders on this show, not because they are TinySeed founders, but because they have really interesting stories and most TinySeed founders are also part of the Startup To The Rest Of Us and the MicroConf community and Eran is no exception. I do ask Eran why he applied to TinySeed in this episode and you’ll hear his answer if you feel like TinySeed could be a fit for you as a bootstrapped SaaS founder, head to TinySeed.com/apply. We are opening applications for our fall batch within the next week, and that will run for about two weeks. If you hear this after September of 2024, you can always go to TinySeed.com/apply to get on our email list and learn about our next open enrollment. In addition, if you are an accredited investor and you’re interested in investing in companies like Gymdesk, ambitious B2B, bootstrapped SaaS founders, head to TinySeed.com/invest. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Eran. Hey, Eran Galperin, welcome to the show.  Eran Galperin:Hey Rob, how’s it going?  Rob Walling:It’s good, man. It’s been a long time coming. I’m glad to have you on here. So folks have probably noticed from the title of this episode that you had a $32.5 million strategic growth investment from Five Elms Capital. And I want to start the show by asking you what did it feel like that moment where you’ve refreshed your bank balance and you saw more zeros than you probably ever imagined that you would have?  Eran Galperin:It’s surprisingly a large feeling of relief. It was the end of a very grueling, even though not long, maybe in competitive terms, but for me, long process of three months where basically every day I doubted that this would actually end up well. And many times as sort of a psychological trick, I would kind of let myself feel, “So what if it falls apart? It’s all good.” When the money hit the bank account. Actually it happened very fast. We closed the deal on a Friday, 30 minutes before the wire cut off time and the funds were in the bank account the same day. I did not expect that before the weekend and I’m just like, “I guess it’s over. I guess it’s done. I can have a real night’s sleep today and maybe the entire weekend.” And I literally slept 14 hours a day for the entire weekend. That mainly just a massive feeling of relief. All this weight just washed down.  Rob Walling:That’s incredible. And had you been planning in your head of, “Once I have this money, I’m going to do XYZ with it.” Or did it just come in and you thought to yourself, “Well, this is it, I’m set for life at this point”?  Eran Galperin:It’s kind of a mix of both. So I didn’t really have an idea for things to buy, but I already had in my head financial plan of how I’m going to deploy this. I’m a proponent of the FIRE methodology, if you heard of it. Financial independence retire early and it’s basically revolves around investing in fund indexes that return a very stable amount every year and with this amount of money, I’m basically set for life if I follow this approach. So I knew I was going to do that. I ended up upgrading my car to basically the same model but newer and higher trim because I really liked that car. And now we’re in the process of, we bought a piece of land here in Tokyo where I live and we’re building a house on it. So that’s super exciting. Not something that I actually planned, but a month after the sale was completed, it’s like, “You know what? We should start looking into it.” And we’re now in the process. Those are the major things.  Rob Walling:What kind of car do you have?  Eran Galperin:So now I have an Audi RS3 for people who are into that kind of stuff.  Rob Walling:Nice.  Eran Galperin:It’s a nice car. It’s still compact, which fits with the very narrow streets of Tokyo, but it’s just a slight upgrade from the previous car, which was an S3. Basically exactly the same car on the inside, but a small upgrade that I felt like was well-deserved.  Rob Walling:Yeah, no doubt. And for folks listening, when I say you received a 32.5 million strategic growth investment for your company, Gymdesk, and we’ll get into what Gymdesk is and what it does in a minute, what does that term mean? Because a lot of folks might be thinking, “Oh, a growth investment, that means you raised money that went into the company.”  Eran Galperin:So our investor is a private equity firm and they did a majority acquisition of the company. They bought a majority stake of the company. I am left with a minority stake in it, and some of the funds are going to be used to grow the company. The majority of it is for them to acquire the controlling stake of the company. This is what the amount that is on the public statement is for.  Rob Walling:And so that means it goes to you and other shareholders and full disclosure, you’re a TinySeed company and so TinySeed obviously received some money as well, but that’s not why you’re on the show. You’re on this program because your story is pretty remarkable in terms of how you executed, how fast you grew and how you went about the sale process. So I want to roll us back a few years. Before I do that, I want to let folks know Gymdesk. Gymdesk.com, your H1 is gym management software that frees up your time and helps you grow simplified billing, enrollment, member management and marketing features that help you grow your gym or martial arts school. So take me back before you started Gymdesk and I know the inside baseball, Martial Arts on Rails was actually what Gymdesk was called, which is such a cool name for developers. I’m like, “Well of course I know exactly why he named it that.” But such not a cool name for non-developers, right? Because clunky, it’s long. People are like, “What do you mean on rails?” Did you get a lot of that? Is that why? Because you rebranded the company in ’21 or ’22 I think.  Eran Galperin:Most of our customers just referred to us as MA on Rails or just MAOR or some reason. I hated that acronym, but a lot of them used it and I just ran with it. So yeah, at the time I just winded down a previous company, a VC-backed company called BinPress that raised a seed round and just didn’t grow enough to raise another round and I was kind of burnt out on the VC model. It’s like I felt that company had potential, but because it didn’t fit the VC timeline, it had to shut down. So I wanted to go in a different direction. Me and my co-founder kind of split paths. He moved to the dark side and became a VC partner, and I started a bootstrap company back then that was called Martial Arts on Rails. I wanted to combine my hobby of many years, which was training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, nine years at the time with my professional skills in software development. I did a lot of market research initially, I kind of tried avoiding going into the vertical we ended up going in, which is business management software because there’s some very entrenched players in this space. Now I know that that’s actually an advantage. They do a lot of the customer education for us. There’s obviously a lot of potential revenue to be had because they’re so big, but back then it looked very intimidating. Eventually I did decide to go that route just because everybody I talked to in this space said the current incumbents were just so awful. So I don’t want to name any names, but anybody in this space knows exactly who they are and I felt with my experience in user experience and software development, I could bring something better to the market. We launched in 2016 and me being a technical founder in every stop previously I was the CTO, some kind of engineering leader. I quickly realized that I had zero idea on how to acquire customers. And so began this kind of slow trial from zero to a livable wage over the course of three and a half years during which I got a full-time job as initially a software engineer and eventually a CTO of a e-commerce company in L.A. And only in 2019 I started working full-time on the business.  Rob Walling:Got it. So you were three years in, three years and nights and weekends on Martial Arts on Rails, which became Gymdesk. So that’s interesting. So it’s not the overnight success that people might paint it out to be, right?  Eran Galperin:It actually, it didn’t feel quick to me the last couple of years went in a blur when we were growing pretty fast every year, but the first five were a slog for sure.  Rob Walling:This is something I talk a lot about online or on this podcast is folks who don’t stick with an idea long enough and they launch one thing and then one thing and then one thing, “Nothing’s taking off so I’m just going to…” You were three and a half years in before you even had a full-time income, and then there was kind of a, I’d call it like a bootstrap or hockey stick moment where we saw this because you applied to TinySeed, I believe in 2021. You were cranking up, I think you were. Do you remember you were 30, 40K MRR by then?  Eran Galperin:Yeah, I was around 35K and by the time the program started already 40 and I remember having chats with some of the founders and the meetup we had in Arizona and they’re like, “You’re at 40K, why did you join TinySeed?” And I had a different calculation than them in my mind because I had the same kind of dilemma when I was thinking about applying. It’s like, “We’re doing pretty well. What can I get from TinySeed that I can’t get by myself?” And the framework that I use is if TinySeed helps increase the value of the company by more than the equity that they take, which was 10%, then it’s worth it. And it ended up being way worth it. So I think in that regard, it doesn’t matter that we were at 35 because we came in for maybe different reasons than some of the other companies in the batch.  Rob Walling:There are different reasons why some folks come in because they’re super early stage and they really do want guidance help finding product market fit. You didn’t need that. You already had it pretty strong. Some folks come in like I could really use the 120 to 250K investment. You didn’t really. Now I know it was a little bit helpful, but that’s not why you were doing it. Why did you decide, and really I think the question is what did you ultimately get out of TinySeed that makes you say it was worth it?  Eran Galperin:A lot of it, well, it started with me following your content on Startups For The Rest Of Us. I’ve talked to many investors and I can tell when somebody actually knows what they’re talking about. They’re not just repeating stuff they read on somebody else’s blog, listened to on a podcast, which is the case with a lot of the investors that I see. And I was coming in to get that kind of advice one-on-one. This is my first company that I’m building bootstrap first company that I got to a certain scale that I haven’t been able to at previous companies and I’m going into a lot of uncharted territory. I remember that we had pricing realignment engagement together. Me and you sat together and talked it over. That was a very scary process for me. We had a lot of long-term customers and I’m about to really ramp up the pricing on them and it helps so much that I can do it with somebody that already ran this playbook, also seen it fail at other companies, even your own after acquisition, I guess. That really helped me do this confidently and it went super well and actually kickstarted the next upward strand in our revenue growth and there were multiple such instances. This is the main reason that I joined TinySeed.  Rob Walling:I think that makes a lot of sense. Community and mentorship are the two things most people name most often and it sounds like the mentorship and advice was a big piece for you. You entered an extremely competitive space. There’s one 900 pound gorilla who as you said, no one likes, but there are dozens. I mean I’ll say every TinySeed batch we get one or two applicants at least that make it into calls that do something similar to this. Why did you succeed?  Eran Galperin:I think I can tell pretty accurately why we succeeded and it’s because we went against what everybody else in the market is doing. So we have the 900 pound gorilla like you mentioned, and a lot of the similar competitors kind of copied their playbook. They have a product and I think this is coming in a lot of B2B verticals that is very outdated and difficult to use. I guess the thinking is that business software doesn’t need to be accessible or easy to use and they just have a very strong sales motion and a lot of our other competitors are pretty much the same. I mean their products started at different points in time, so you can kind of tell, “Oh, this one is from ’08, this one is from 2011.” But they never bothered updating it afterwards. When I started Gymdesk without any sales knowledge, the only thing I can do was just talk to customers and make the product better. I myself went through a transformation with this company where I used to be that technical person that engineering lead that it would come to with customer complaints and it’s like, “Yeah, they’re using it wrong. They’re not very smart.” I would say mean things like that. And with this product I kind of realized it’s actually the opposite. The dumber, the feedback looks like the more opportunity there is to make the product better, and I really took that to heart and through this endless feedback loop made a product that just makes everything so much easier than our competitors. We might have a similar feature set, but the way those features and flows are implemented is completely different. And this is where I feel we really made our first kind of differentiation in the market. The other side of it is with the customer service. So anybody who works with me knows how responsive I am to emails, and it was the same with customers in the going when I was the only one talking to them. And when I started hiring for customer service, I made sure that we stayed with that mentality. Somebody sends a report that something is not working, we have to get back to them as early as possible and resolve it as quickly as possible. Not just issues, but also small feature requests where it seems like it’s a no-brainer. We would roll those out sometimes same day. You can find reviews of us on Capterra and other websites where the guy’s like, “Yeah, I messaged customer service, I talked to the CEO, and on the same day I get a new feature that solves our use case.” And you can’t beat that kind of experience. So this is how we kind of build our brand in this space.  Rob Walling:Got it. So you’ve referenced product that you built your product differently. It’s not just great product, but it is actually zigging when others were zagging, sales motion, they were really heavily on sales and you were more allowed self-serve I’m assuming, but.  Eran Galperin:I’m 100% optimized for self-serve, so it’s maybe a bit ridiculous, but in the early days, I actually refused doing demos. I just hate getting on video calls with people I don’t know. And people would email in, “I want the demo.” It’s like, “Yeah, we don’t do that. I’ll be happy to answer your questions over email, which is the medium I’m comfortable with.” But for years we just didn’t do any demos. We do do demos now. We have a full team, they help with onboarding, but because we didn’t have any demos and none of that motion at all, I really had to make the product shine in those aspects. So every time people would say, “Oh, I can’t do this in onboarding.” It’s like, “Okay, let me go back to the product and fix it like that instead of getting on a call and explaining to you how to do it.”  Rob Walling:And then support, as you’re saying, was exceptional. There’s one other thing you didn’t touch on that I watched firsthand. I watched you execute exceptionally well, like top 10%, top 5% of founders that I work with, and you are a technical founder who in 2016 launched Martial Arts on Rails and you didn’t know how to market. By the time I knew you in 2021, you knew enough about how to market that you were driving consistent, consistent, consistent growth. I say that word three times because it was just every month there were no plateaus. And then it just got better. I mean, the growth got faster. You eventually hired a head of growth and I mean you coming from development to marketing, a lot of people, as much as I say it on this podcast of all the successful TinySeed companies, all the TinySeed companies doing seven figures, pretty much inevitably one of the founders runs marketing from the start. Now you can eventually hire someone to do it, blah, blah, blah, but trying to outsource marketing when you’re 10K MRR, you and I both know that’s probably not a good idea. So my question is there’s a long way of asking how did you figure this out? How did you get good at driving tons of leads because everything else you said, building a great product, great support, self-serve people do that, and then they flounder and they plateau at 10K because they don’t know how to drive traffic. So I don’t know how to drive traffic or leads. How did you figure this out?  Eran Galperin:Yeah, I mean that’s definitely the part of building this company that took me the longest to figure out. I do have some background in writing, so I’ve written a lot over the years, mostly technical writing, but eventually moved into, I wrote about startups going through accelerators, stuff like that. So I had that in my back pocket. Also, some experience with technical SEO, so I thought for sure with SEO I could drive some leads to the product. Turns out that was also naive. It took me quite a while to figure out the SEO for this company, but now I have such a good handle on it that I advise other SaaS companies on this particular topic. I just had a call with one of the TinySeed companies where I analyzed their entire SEO structure and gave them actionable items. This is one of the things, it’s not like this with every marketing channel. Maybe it is, I haven’t figured it out yet, but specifically with organic traffic, you can approach it almost like an engineering challenge and really figure out a plan to attack it. And we built a really structured repeatable process there to expand and also retain the land that we acquire in SEO because to keep your rankings, it’s very difficult in a competitive market. It took me, I want to say five years to really figure that out. In 2021, when we hired the first full-time employee that was a content marketing editor, I knew this is our strongest channel and this is our best writer and I want to just keep investing in this channel. And it paid off. We still drive most of our leads through SEO. I think it’s over 60, 70% of our leads come through that channel, and they’re all extremely qualified leads. It’s a channel with a lot of buying intent. So yeah, it’s definitely something I had to work on. But just persistence with everything else, trying and failing, trying and failing and figuring it out, that’s how we did it.  Rob Walling:And to give folks an idea from ’21 to ’22 you doubled, from ’22 to ’23 you doubled, from ’23 to ’24 is not over, but you’re on pace to double. So it is like a really interesting growth curve. I like to call this because you started in 2016, it’s eight years to overnight success because all the people on X-Twitter want to know, how many people do you and I know that would stick with something for five years kind of grinding it out to figure it out?  Eran Galperin:I follow some people on Twitter that literally what they do is they build a tiny SaaS product and they give it a couple of months and then they sell it for peanuts on microacquire.com, I think it just acquire.com now. And just move on to the next. And they keep hoping that one of those will blow up, but that’s not how it works. If you’re going to only stay with it for a few months, it’s never going to happen.  Rob Walling:I want to dive into the acquisition because you received a lot of inbound interest. You told me offline, you said you initially ignored it. So it was what, 2021, you start receiving private equity firms that are reaching out, and this is a very common thing. People hit mid six figures, get into the seven figures, and it just happens. So how are you thinking about and dealing with all that inbound interest?  Eran Galperin:When it started initially, first of all, the language that they use in a lot of this inbound, it is very vague. I didn’t think it was about buying the company. I thought it was venture investment basically. They talk about growth equity, like we said at the beginning. At that time, I didn’t know exactly what that meant. It’s like, “Oh, are you interested in growth investment into your company?” I’m like, “No, I’m bootstrapped. Not interested in that.” Eventually one of them actually used direct language and I’m like, “Okay, interesting. I think we’re too small, but let’s talk and see where it’s at.” And we were too small at that time, but I started to get a sense of how things might go. And between 2021 and 2023, I must have taken close to 40 calls with different private investors, search funds, all sorts of different constellations. And I really got a pretty good lay of the land as to what a potential outcome might look like and at what revenue numbers it would make sense to sell. And I started having this kind of mental funnel in my head. It’s like, “Okay, if we hit those benchmarks, maybe it’s time to start thinking about running a process.”  Rob Walling:Got it. Why not run the company forever and take out profits?  Eran Galperin:That’s definitely an option. And some people do this, but I started to feel some burnout even in 2021. I ran the company with a bootstrapper’s mindset, always hiring maybe a couple of steps later than I really should have because I’m optimizing for profits. It’s really hard to disconnect the revenue going into the company from your own finances. At the end of the day, anything that’s left over in the company is your revenue personally, and I was doing a lot, just maybe doing too much was feeling burnout. And at some point it’s like, “You know what? I would be happy to take a step back and let somebody else run the company.” There’s also when you’re at a smaller scale and you self-select for the customers, everybody’s nice and it’s a pleasure to work with, but as you hit a certain scale, the small percentage of people that, I can’t think of a better word, just nasty people and you have to deal with them. And it gets to the point those people are above the level of even a full-time customer service person to handle, it leaves a dent in you. It always feels like they’re going to ruin your company’s reputation. We had people like trash us and all the social media channels for the pettiest stuff. I have stories that just make my blood boil when I think about it and I just don’t want to deal with it. Does this emotional connection as a founder, CEO, that maybe a professional CEO would not have because they didn’t build the company, they don’t feel it in their bones and somebody is just saying nasty things about them online and I just wanted to kind of remove myself a little bit from that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I experienced the same thing. We don’t talk about that very much, but that stuff takes a toll on you. I don’t know if you got threatened, but I got threatened multiple times with where I’m like, “Do you mean that? This is becoming a safety issue.” It’s a law of large numbers. It’s like at a few hundred customers you kind of know everybody, at 1000 users, customers, it becomes a lot. And then we eventually had a free plan, so we had 30, 40,000 users at a certain point. It’s like you’re going to get some mentally unstable, demanding, narcissistic folks. And yeah, I can see it. Everyone sells. Like I say this, everyone sells eventually. I never thought MailChimp would sell and they eventually sold. I mean really, I had all these examples and they’ve all sold except for I think Basecamp is probably the one that I think about. So then I guess the question then is you start feeling like, all right, I’m burning out. This business is obviously worth a lot of money, but how did you know when it was time to sell? Because you could have sold it at a million ARR or two. It’s like do you just arbitrarily pick a point? What was it like for you?  Eran Galperin:So because we received so much inbound interest, I did really have a lot of insight into where an optimal result might happen, and it did seem to really funnel around a few million in ARR. That’s where a lot of the bigger players that can actually pay the big multiples start getting interested. At the lower ARR there’s definitely interest, but people would try for bargain. The multiples are lower, the terms are not as good, and I saw a very direct line to that number. With our growth numbers I was running this kind of projection P\u0026L where if we continue at the same pace that we’ve been growing and add a little bit to it every few months, and it ended up being almost to the dollar accurate all the way up to 3 million. So as long as I was continuing with the trend that I built there, I’m like, “You know what? I’m good. I don’t need to sell now.” Unless I see crazy warning signs. And by the way, those crazy customers, those were the warning signs, like, “Is this it? Is this where I’m taking a tumble down death row for the company?” That did make me wonder, maybe it’s time to sell now before I really run into that customers that tries to ruin our business. But as long as we kept on that trend I could see the path. It didn’t seem too long. So if it was like five years into the future, I would not be able to do it. But it was about two years into the future I was like, “I think I can hold on for that and have a life-changing outcome there.”  Rob Walling:And let’s talk through the sales process because you’re one of the few people that I can talk to about how painful this is. And here’s the hard part is if you go on social media, if I say on this podcast, “Oh, it was so stressful. It was really stressful. No, trust me, it’s really stressful.” People say, “I’m sure it wasn’t that stressful. And also you walked away with money that you never had to work again. So really just deal with it.” But it drives people, it can drive people to the edge, to the brink, to the point of not sleeping to the point of I started having, hallucinations is not the right word, that would take it too far, but I started making shit up in my head that just wasn’t true. And at a certain point, Sherry, my wife was like, “Hey, do you know that that’s not, you’re in a weird place. You’re really fighting with people in a way that’s not healthy for you.” So for you, you worked with Discretion Capital folks on the podcast. No, A\u0026R runs that and helps as a sell side advisory for SaaS doing multi-millions. And what was the process like for you? You can talk maybe a little bit about the mechanics of it, of how it actually panned out, but also personally, emotionally, what that all felt like.  Eran Galperin:Yeah, the process was much more stressful that I anticipated, and it’s mostly psychological in its core. First of all, it’s a very technical process. That’s another thing that I didn’t anticipate everybody reads about due diligence. It seems like a very straightforward thing. You just provide the documents for the company, you let them look at your code base, la-da-dee-la-da and you’re done. And it’s so great, but it’s actually so technical and complicated. There were times during due diligence and it’s mostly around stuff like taxes and company structure that the other side’s legal team would just disappear for three, four days a week looking into something. And I’m like, “Is this a big problem? Is this a small problem? Is this taking down the deal?” I just have no idea. And this kind of ambiguity where you have no idea if things are going well or not for weeks at a time, it really gets to you eventually. And it’s a lot very minute things written in some contract from few years ago, and it’s like, “Is this a problem? It looks so minor. Is this really a problem?” And they’re like, “We don’t know. We’re going to need more time to find out.” It’s like, “Sounds bad.” But you just stick with it and eventually you get through due diligence and then you have the purchase agreement aspect. I thought once we’re done with due diligence, we’re done. We just need to sign the contracts and get on with our lives. But hell no. That was just half of the process. It was crazy.  Rob Walling:You keep spring [inaudible 00:29:21]. Yeah, you just don’t know.  Eran Galperin:Yeah, you just don’t know those things. Luckily I had Einar to provide some emotional support. He told me that basically his role once the process starts is to be therapist for the founders. And it pretty much ended that way. Every time I would go to him, it’s like, “How big is this issue?” And it’s like, “Don’t worry. It happens in every sale process.” Like, “Okay, if Einar says it happens every time, it’s fine.”  Rob Walling:It’ll be okay.  Eran Galperin:So he would calm me down and this would happen a lot. Him and my lawyer, I want to give credit to Kaiser, just did an amazing job, especially during the purchase agreements. Every word in those agreements can have such a long-term effect on your life and you’re like, “I don’t even know what any of this means.” So having a really good lawyer that is patient and kind enough to explain it in a way that you can understand is so important. And still, we would get hung up on things where us and the buyer had some sort of disagreement on, and is this solvable? I don’t know. And again, days would go by, weeks would go by from my end, this is the only thing going on in my life other than running the business, but they’re dealing with multiple deals at the same time. So I don’t know if they’re just ghosting me or actually busy. Is this a tactic that they’re using to get me to come to their side? It’s super stressful. I usually consider myself a very even-keeled person, and I was taken aback by how stressed I got near the end of the deal. Even though we had all this inbound interest, I felt like if this deal falls apart and we go back to market, we will be able to get a really good outcome regardless. But I just didn’t, once you get too deep into it, you hate so much to go back to the beginning, do the due diligence again, like, “Oh my god, to go for that will be a nightmare.” So yeah, near the end of the process, I literally got insomnia. I would lie down in my bed, refreshing, looking for emails from the lawyer that I felt like, “Okay, I have to get out of bed, respond to this now, otherwise I’m going to stop this deal for the weekend because it’s a Friday.” And it’s got to the point where once I turn the phone off and I’m trying to go to sleep, I just can’t fall asleep. So it’s like, “Okay, it’s eight A.M. I’m just getting up. I didn’t sleep today. I’ll just keep going.” And, “Oh, what do you know? Another email came in from the lawyer. So good thing I didn’t go to sleep.” And it just stayed like that for the last couple of weeks of the process.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s brutal. It’s brutal on your mental health and on your physical health. Not sleeping is rough too. Then that, just everything else is distorted. You can’t get through that, but you made it to the finish line. We started with this conversation, hearing you refreshing that bank balance and seeing all the zeros, huge sense of relief. You’re still a CEO of Gymdesk, but what are you doing now as you look ahead over the next six months, five years? What’s on your mind and what are you doing with regards to Gymdesk and with other projects?  Eran Galperin:Yeah, so as I mentioned, one of the goals, or rather one of the reasons for selling the company was due to burnout. And when I was talking the terms with the buyer, I mentioned that I would like to step down as CEO after the company is sold and probably over the course of maybe a year or two, eventually walk away from the company or at least have the ability to do that. So currently I’m still the CEO. We closed the deal two and a half months ago. We’re in the process of recruiting a professional CEO to come in and take over for me. I literally had an interview just before this call, an hour long interview, by the way, it’s been a fascinating process interviewing for the CEO position. I’m talking to really incredible people and I’m super excited to potentially work with those people. With me taking a small role in the company, mainly focusing on product. That’s where I feel I can make the most impact at the company. I’ve been doing well in the other aspects, but those are definitely not my strong suits. So going back to focusing on product and over time, reducing my involvement in the company. I still hold some minority stake in the company, so I want it to do well, but maybe more on a consultancy basis eventually. The main thing for me right now, and I already started doing that, is I’m looking to help mentor other B2B SaaS founders from that zero to one and a potential sale process, and also do some angel investing in that same realm. So I’m talking to a few founders already. Those conversations actually are incredibly invigorating for me.  Rob Walling:You get to see the other side.  Eran Galperin:Yeah, I’m just incredibly happy to talk about those topics. It’s like I have somebody who also understands what I’m talking about and having those conversations kind of like what we’re doing right now.  Rob Walling:Yeah, this is the best job I’ve ever had, what I do both on this podcast, but running my heart on a TinySeed, I get to do that every day. And you see the appeal of it. It keeps you in the game, it keeps your head sharp, but you don’t necessarily have to do the grind that you did for so many years where everything’s hanging by a thread. If someone just heard you talk about, “Hey, I am mentoring and potentially angel investing, they wanted to reach out to you, what would be the easiest way for them to reach you?  Eran Galperin:So I have my personal website, it’s EranGalperin.com if you just Google my name, you’ll find it. You can contact me through there. Also, I’m on Twitter and LinkedIn, easy to find. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk. I’m super excited to talk to founders about B2B SaaS. It’s kind of my thing right now.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and it’s not just, “Hey, talk to me if you want me to invest or something.” But it’s like you’re pretty free with your advice and you have obviously a lot of knowledge and experience having grown this company in extremely competitive space and having an incredible life-changing exit.  Eran Galperin:Yeah, it always gets me worked up to talk to a founders in the early stages and hearing about what they’re doing. It’s like, “Wow, that’s so exciting.” So yeah, I love having those calls.  Rob Walling:Eran Galperin, thanks so much for joining me on the show today.  Eran Galperin:Thank you so much, Rob.

Today’s episode is Hot Take Tuesday. Welcome back, Einar and Tracy, and we talk about topics relating to bootstrapping and growing your company, including how mostly bootstrap company, Gymdesk, sold for more than $32.5 million. In fact, after we recorded this episode, I recorded an interview with the founder of Gymdesk that will air on this very feed in the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned for that. Today we also talk about whether hiring is getting easier for bootstrappers, what changes in mindset might be present between founders at different MRR levels, how to identify what really moves the needle, and more Hot Take Tuesday topics. Before we dive into the episode, if you’re not on the email list for this show, you should head to startupsfortherestofus.com, enter your email. What you’ll receive from there is a weekly email with the show notes and a recap of every episode with timestamps. You can of course opt out of that and still receive the less frequent emails we send. But you’ll also receive two never-before-released episodes, Eight Things You Should Know Before Launching Your SaaS, and, 10 Things You Should Know as You Grow Your SaaS, as well as a PDF of the 5 PM Framework. In addition, I’m just wrapping up a book about selling your company. My wife, Dr. Sherry Walling and I, are in the final days of locking in that manuscript. If you get on the email list here, you will hear about that book when it goes live. So, with that, let’s dive in to Hot Take Tuesday. Welcome back to this Hot Take Tuesday Roundtable. My first guest is someone you know very well. Tracy Makes on Twitter, our very own Tracy Osborn. Hey, Tracy. Welcome.  Tracy Osborn:Excited to be back.  Rob Walling:It’s been a while since Hot Take Tuesday. Bit of travel, bit of not a lot of news. I mean even today, I like the docket today, but two or three of them are just questions that I think that-  Tracy Osborn:It’s the summer.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah, things are chill.  Rob Walling:My other panelist is TinySeed’s very own, Einar Vollset. Welcome to the show.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Let’s dive right into our first story, and we will link this up in the show notes. It’s a PR Newswire article. It says, “Gymdesk announces a $32.5 million dollar strategic growth investment from Five Elms Capital.” Gymdesk of course being a TinySeed company.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah.  Rob Walling:So, we are stoked about this. I’m very happy for Eran, the founder. I think the question I want to toss to you first, Einar, is, does this prove or at least help to prove our thesis of TinySeed? Which is B2B SaaS companies are worth a lot of money, and even the little ones, even the TinySeeds and the MicroConfs, they don’t have to be unicorns to have enormous valuations. Obviously raising at 32.5 million means this company is extremely valuable now. So, talk us through your thinking.  Einar Vollset:Yeah. I mean, they didn’t raise at 32.5 million, they raised 32.5 million. The valuation was even higher than that. I think it’s a great story. As we know, even the majority of our successful companies don’t even necessarily raise any more money after us, but I think what this shows is that some of the TinySeed companies will grow into companies that will take this kind of money from growth private equity, where it’s like, there’s a lot… I actually think a lot of people don’t realize that these software private equity growth capital funds even exist. They think, okay. There’s VC and that’s it. But realistically, once you get past about a million in ARR, there are pretty deep pools of capital that are interested in investing in these kind of companies and taking them further and taking them to the next level. So, in that regard, it’s very exciting for us. It’s obviously very exciting for Eran and the team, and I think TinySeed, we sold some of our equity as part of the transaction, but we also rolled a substantial amount forward, and we expect them to just keep growing. The big player, so Gymdesk is obviously in the gym management fitness space. The big player in the space is publicly traded, Mindbody. Everyone in the space hates Mindbody, and I think there’s a path to where Gymdesk basically becomes the better version of Mindbody and potentially is public down the line. So, for us it’s very exciting.  Rob Walling:It’s great as a founder to enter a space with a big incumbent that everyone hates, and to be in a vertical. This is something I called back in January, my predictions for this year of vertical SaaS and orthogonal SaaS are the places where we see a lot of opportunity for founders, not only to get in and carve out a space for themselves, but I would argue, I would posit that exiting and evaluations can likely be higher than if you’re building a big horizontal thing.  Einar Vollset:I think that’s true. I mean, I think in general too, I see this in the Discretion Capital side. We see the appetite for M\u0026A and outcomes is substantially higher for sticky vertical SaaS, where there’s high recurrence, low churn. Obviously they want growth, but they don’t need to have 500, 600% year-over-year growth to have a business that is backable or acquirable at that size. It’s also, it’s one of those things like, look. Gymdesk, they raised his money at a huge valuation, but the only other money they raised was from us. That was it.  Rob Walling:Right. I wonder if this means they’re no longer mostly bootstrapped because that’s a lot of money. It’s a lot of money. Just so people have an idea before I kick it to Tracy, Einar mentioned Discretion Capital, he is the founder of Discretion Capital, which is an M\u0026A advisory for B2B SaaS companies doing two to 25 million ARR, and Discretion represented Eran and Gymdesk in this transaction.  Einar Vollset:Yes, indeed.  Rob Walling:Tracy, what’s your take on this whole deal?  Tracy Osborn:To repeat what Einar said, it was the whole private equity path. When I was a startup founder and when I first started TinySeed, I didn’t even realize that was an option. I’ve been seeing articles, I’ve been hearing Einar talk about this for the last few years, and then I’ve been seeing articles in the last few months about more people talking about the current economic climate when it comes to venture capital, and how private equity is becoming more of an option, or more of something where people want to go for. People are more aware of it and it’s more of a desirable option for a lot of companies that are wanting to exit. So, it’s really cool to see an example on this directly from TinySeed. I think this is a great example to other founders out there who might be struggling with traditional VC to look at this direction, because I think there’s some folks who are just like, “Uh, private equity.” I think there’s cases like this where you can see where private equity can position Gymdesk and give them resources they need to grow up against something like Mindbody.  Einar Vollset:Yeah. I think it’s true. I think fundamentally a lot of people have a view of private equity is from a Bruce Springsteen song. It’s like they came to town, they bought the factory, shut it down, and now my father’s an alcoholic, type thing. But what this proves, and look. Gymdesk isn’t the first company, TinySeed company that did this. We’ve had at least one or two more. We think, given the number of companies that we’re backing and how they’re growing, we’re expecting more and more companies to decide that they’ll get to a million or two or five or whatever, and decide that whatever got us here won’t get us there. Having more capital and in some cases advice and experience to go from say five to 50 million in ARR, is a viable path. I also think that there are more companies that started out on the IPO VC path, and have built substantial businesses that make sense. They’re doing two or five or 10 million or more, and they realized they’re not growing it. I think it was Gary Tan had put out some stat about 2023 as like, the medium growth rate you had to have to be a successful series A VC, raise a series A VC round in 2023, was 600% year-over-year growth, but-  Rob Walling:A lot of companies aren’t going to hit that.  Einar Vollset:That’s not the only path. Yeah, that’s not the only path. Look, there are companies out there, there are investors, certainly you probably have to be at a reasonable scale. The fundamental thing about private equity is they care more about downside protection than VC does. But the flip side is, if you can provide that downside protection by being at a certain scale, then the kind of outcome that they’re looking for, three to five X in three to five years, might be better and more aligned with what it is that you want to do with your life. It’s like the way that I put it in one of the projects that I’ve got going called, Next Catalyst, is do you want to be rich or do you want to be king? There are some people who basically the thing they care the most about is to be famous. They want to be known as the Elon Musk of the world. They want to be known as an amazing startup founder that succeeded and rang the bell at NASDAQ. Then there’s the rest of us who is like, “You know what? I’d rather just be rich.”  Rob Walling:Onto our next topic with layoffs and back to the office, in effect. Is it getting easier for bootstrappers to hire? Tracy, what is the word on the street? We have 171 investments across TinySeed, B2B SaaS, almost 300 founders now. What’s the word that you’re hearing in terms of hiring difficulty or ease compared to the last couple of years?  Tracy Osborn:That’s an interesting question. Actually, I’m not sure if I have specific stats on that. I have a lot of gut feelings. I mean, hiring is always hard, right?  Rob Walling:Gut feelings are fine.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. Hiring is always going to be hard. With the folks who are used to working from home and they want to have those benefits of working at home, there’s pros and cons in all of this. Where these giant companies want people to go back to the office, and so they could be looking for… Might be easier to find these folks who are wanting to work from home, and might be easier to find those folks that work at those big companies. However, the other thing that I think I’ve heard about is also the mindset of these potential employees and whether they fit within a bootstrap company. Because a bootstrap company is not going to pay as well as one of these giant companies. There’s going to be a lot of benefits, like working from home and the flexibility that you would get that people might have got used to in this era of being able to work from home. But bootstrap companies are going to have to work a little bit differently. So, there’s some pros and cons there for the folks who are trying to find these workers. It might be easier to find people, but they might not have the right mindset.  Rob Walling:To give you some data, we just released a State of Independent SaaS Report for 2024. Folks can download that at stateofindiesaas.com. In it, let’s see, I’m on page 18, it says, “85% of companies we surveyed,” so we surveyed 700, almost 700 bootstrap, mostly bootstrap SaaS companies, all MicroConf, TinySeed type companies. “85% reported that the difficulty in hiring people is either the same or easier than last year.” That feels about right. Most people are saying it’s same or easier. In addition, this was I think the first year where we saw hiring, maybe it was the first time we surveyed because it was two years ago, but, “We see that 30% fewer companies are hired in 2023 compared to 2021.” Again, this is bootstrap companies. We know there was a big VC bubble and there was a lot of hiring and now there’s layoffs, but it certainly happens across our type of bootstrap companies as well. The plan to hire in the next 12 months was down 17%. So, even though it, to me, anecdotally and obviously from these numbers, it appears that it is easier for bootstrappers to hire. I think a lot due to what I already mentioned, which was like, there’s a bunch of layoffs and there’s a lot of back to the office, and that’s all… Being remote has always been a bootstrapper advantage. Einar Vollset, you have anything to add?  Einar Vollset:No. I think that’s pretty much it. I mean, I think certainly the return to work is part of it. I also think there’s less competition from the larger firms, who back in the boom days were just hoovering up every talent and not talent in the world. That’s not been happening and layoffs have been happening. So, people aren’t just like, “Why would I ever work for a bootstrap thing? Anyone can get a job paying crazy money at Big Co.” Those days are not there anymore. So, that might be part of it too.  Rob Walling:Our next topic is a question from Twitter, and I don’t know if I want to answer the exact question. So, the question is from @SunglassesFace, name is Orly. “What change in mindset do you notice between founders with 100 MRR, 1,000 MRR, 10,000 MRR or 100,000 MRR?” The reason I want to change the question is, we’ve watched dozens of founders hit all of those milestones and they’re the same founder. The mindset doesn’t shift that much. You look at a Ruben Gomez or a Ron Galperin or Gymdesk. It’s like, the mindset from the start was, do things really fast, ship a lot of… Be mostly correct. Be right most of the time, have a good gut feeling. You do that when you’re at 100 and you do that when you’re at 100,000 MRR. But I don’t think that’s what Orly @SunglassesFace is asking. I almost think the question is, how do the challenges that you face differ from 100 to 1,000, to 10,000, to 100,000 MRR?  Tracy Osborn:Well, I think it’s a misconception, because some folks, I think, when they’re at the early stage, it’s like, “Is my mindset wrong? Is the reason why I’m not growing, is it because of my mindset?” So, I think that question stems from this misconception and that’s what you’re trying to explain. I just wanted to harp on that thing, is that there’s a lot of things to do. It’s not necessarily just mindset, you have to have a growth mindset, but that growth mindset is going to be there at every stage.  Rob Walling:I agree. With that in mind, Einar, what do you think the changes are? We don’t even have to go through all four of these. But when someone’s at 100 MRR versus 10,000 MRR, let’s contrast those to start. What are the different challenges?  Einar Vollset:I don’t know. At that stage, I don’t know that there is a difference, because I think it’s not that different. There’s a right, I think, strongly opinionated, there’s a right mindset and it’s just, move fast and just do a lot of… Just when it’s working, keep doing more of the stuff that’s working. I think what I observe, and maybe it’s because of how I operate and what I do, I think there’s more of a break at above even these numbers of what he’s talking about. I think what we very commonly see is, I think a lot of people, whether they’re at 100 or 10,000 or whatever MRR, they have this view that, “Oh, once I get to a million in ARR,” 83.33 whatever it is in MRR, “Then everything will be great. That’s it. I’ve made it. I just need to do more of the thing that I’ve already proved, proven to make it.” Actually, Jason Cohen did a great piece on this, talking about, well, I think he called it the Elephant Curves or something like that. It’s basically the myth of continuous exponential growth. What he says is, I think he used the example of HubSpot. He says, “Look. It looks from the outside like it just is up and to the right graph, and that’s how they did it. They just did more of whatever it was that was working. But actually, if you look underneath the covers, it’s one growth curve stacked on top of the other. Where it’s basically, they launched a new product and then they added another channel, and then they launched another product, and another channel.” I think the biggest mindset change that I’ve observed repeatedly is, people, once they get past about a million in ARR, or two or three, they get to the stage they’re like, “Oh, my growth is stalling out now. What I was working, my market is saturated, my niche is saturated.” The mindset change becomes, “Okay. I’ve got to do something new again. Not just a thing that was working. I’ve got to go after another thing and another thing and another thing.” That, I think, is the biggest mindset change. The people who fail to do that, quite often they end up in a situation where, because all growth decays over time, they end up in a scenario where they have a great business that’s growing 100%, and then they have a great business growing 40%, and then they have a great business that’s growing 15%, and then they have a business that’s not really growing, and then it starts to decline and now they’re like, “Crap. I should have sold this a couple of years ago.” I think that happens a fair bit.  Rob Walling:Tracy, what do you think about these revenue MRR levels? Do you agree with Einar? He was saying 100 to 1,000, or 100 to 10,000 is similar. Because I think there’s a difference at 10,000, but I’m curious to hear what you think between these levels.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. What I have in my notes was, early stage is finding product market fit, middle stage is pouring fuel on those areas at work, and then later stage is broadening out. So, disagreeing with what Einar says, and I’ve seen this as well, is that folks get to that certain level of one million in ARR and they’re like, “No. I don’t want to do it again.” It’s like, yeah. You have to figure out how to do it again, but in a different area. So, I guess that’s a mindset thing, is of just that growth mindset, being aware that you’re going to have this wonderful growth and the mindset of knowing that it will end, and therefore being able to react or prevent it and react appropriately before that down curve happens. That is something that we’ve seen a lot of folks run into that trap.  Rob Walling:Right. Looking ahead at your plateaus.  Tracy Osborn:Mm-hmm. Don’t wait till the plateau happens.  Rob Walling:Yeah. I talk about it in three phases, and there are more than this, but the first phase is building a product. Second phase is building a business, third phase is building a company. Usually I think of product as being zero up to usually about 10K MRR, to be honest. It’s like, “I have a product. I’m trying to figure out, does anybody want this? Can I sell it? What’s the pricing?” You’re just fumbling. You have almost no product market fit, or very weak product market fit. Between 10 and 20, I feel like, “Oh, now I have revenue, I’m probably going to have expenses. I have to start thinking about this as a real business a bit.” Then I think from that point up until somewhere in the 50 to 100K, that’s where you’re building the business. Then 50 to 100K, I think you’re building a company. That’s when it’s like, “I need really good people. I probably need to start thinking about hiring managers and delegating a lot more,” because usually in a SaaS company, you have a lot of folks on your team.  Tracy Osborn:Not going to be the first person on the ground anymore, relying on other people. A lot of things are going to change at that point. The mindset to be aware and ready for those changes too.  Rob Walling:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted, senior, results-oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor, Lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. They can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with Lemon.io. “The machine learning engineer they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results.” Long time listener, Chaz Yuen, hired a senior developer from Lemon.io and said his hire, quote, “Definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations.” Chaz said he would definitely use Lemon.io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer.

I posted, I don’t know, it was about a month ago, and said, “Hey, ask some more intermediate and advanced questions.” I like this one. SanderFish says, “Often it feels like SaaS success is an accumulation of many small decisions and improvements over time.” Which I would 100% agree with. “How do you identify what really moves the needle?” Tracy Makes, how do you identify?  Tracy Osborn:I like that Einar brought up earlier in the last question, talking about founders constantly working on new things and getting things done. In that, folks also need to be… They don’t need to lose track of analyzing how well those things do. It doesn’t have to be that hard. As things are going through, make sure that you’re adding the right referral links or whatnot, so that as you’re setting up these marketing campaigns and working on three things at once, that later on you can spend 15 minutes going back and being like, “All right. Cool. I did these three things. Now I can track all these things that are happening.” Sometimes people can get into this thing where they’re like, “Got launch, launch, launch. Do things, do things, do things,” and it’s like what actually was working? What was actually worth the amount of time that you were spending on this? You have to remember to do maybe a monthly cadence of looking back at what you have done in that month and then analyze what things are happening. So, you actually can identify what’s moving that needle. That’s hard to do as a founder because you have to be constantly launch, launch, launch, and it’s really easy to forget to do that analyzing process.  Rob Walling:What do you think Einar? How do you identify what really moves the needle?  Einar Vollset:I think while important, it’s more important just to do more… Then if things are going well, then great. So, I think there’s two hurdles for most founders that I see, that I work with. The main problem isn’t trying to figure out what’s working, it’s doing enough experiments so that something is working. Look, if they do 25 things and then two or three of them are working, but they’re not totally sure which ones are working, but they’re just doing it, that’s much better than what most people do. Which is they overanalyze and do two things and neither of them work, or goes backwards. That being said, I do think it’s important, to Tracy’s point, once you have some stuff that is working, it’s got to be like, “Okay. What do I double down on? What is it that’s really working?” Because the other thing that, mistakes I see people make is, they’ll read the Traction book from Gabriel Weinberg, and they’ll try a bunch of things and something’s working, and then they figure out something’s working, but then they won’t really double down on it and try to squeeze everything out of it and really explore how big that success can be. Instead, they wander off and pick something else to do, and then another thing and another thing. It’s the point where, look. This was working, just double down on the thing and just make sure you squeeze the full growth out of it.  Tracy Osborn:It’s like shiny object syndrome, because it is really fun to launch a new marketing campaign. So, it’s just like, “Oh, how to set up this thing, how to learn a new thing and do this kind of thing,” and forgetting to really track on and follow up on those things.  Einar Vollset:I think sometimes people have this, once they have this working, I know that I do this sometimes, it’s like if they have something that’s working, they’re always like, “Great, it’s working. I always know that I can rely on that and do more of it if it’s working. So, I’m just not going to do that because I have it in my back pocket. Then I’m going to go do these other things and explore more so I have more things in my back pocket.” I think that’s a mistake most of the time. Particularly for growth channels and things like that, it’s like, no. This is working now, but you have no idea, does it work 50% more? Does it work 5,000 times more? You don’t know until you really try. So, I think that’s a mistake people make.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s funny. Tracy said, launching a new marketing campaign is fun, so is launching a new product. It was just building more, so is writing features. I think there are a lot of rules of thumb and a lot of frameworks and guidelines that I talk about on this show, we talk about in MicroConf and obviously to TinySeed companies that are in my book, whatever. You should probably listen to them in most cases, if you don’t know anything else. It’s like, this is a great start. It’s like, learn the rules, then master the rules so that you know when to break them. But if you never learn the rules, then you don’t know that you shouldn’t start a B2C two-sided marketplace with Freemium and launch seven products and blah, blah, blah, and try to do viral marketing on my social media following. I think I’m going to build some incredible business. It’s not impossible what I just said, but the odds are stacked dramatically against you. So, listen to those who have gone before you. When I think about trying to figure out what’s going to move the needle, usually I think, what has moved the needles for others? A million things I could do, but founders who have it working, what are they doing? Then try to generalize that. So, I look at the best, most successful founders. I mean, I was doing this as I was coming up and saying, “What’s Jason Cohen doing? What is Hetan Shah doing? What is these people who are building incredible businesses?” Einar, you have to discount it. They’re not Steve Jobs and they’re not Elon Musk. I am a bootstrapper. I can’t model myself after those people. I can’t even model myself after Basecamp, because I didn’t launch a SaaS in 2004 that gets… What did they say? 10,000 trials a month or something. It’s just, I’m not in that situation. They can do stuff, like not market, like not sell, because they’re in a luxurious position, and good for them. The luck and timing were one and two, Jason Fried told me that for their success. Unless I can replicate luck and timing, I can’t, then I need to look at folks who do it and grind it and figure it out, like Eran from Gymdesk, like Ruben from [inaudible 00:25:00]. There’s dozens and dozens of TinySeed founders that I would look at and try to model. That’s why I write the SaaS Playbook. You can buy it for $10 on Kindle, read through that. If I were to try to prioritize stuff, I would start with the stuff in that book, not the stuff that I see people yapping about on Twitter. The approach is where it’s like, build an audience. Yeah, great, that’s fun. But it’s not for your SaaS company. Build your network, not your audience. So, I don’t know. I prioritize things by first trying to have some type of framework to limit its infinity, things I could try, down to 20, 50. There’s only that many. Then I would, if I have a gut feel, a strong gut feel, I would do it myself. Otherwise, I would get people involved. I’d say, “Einar, what do you think I should do?” I’d say, “Tracy, Ruben, Eran, what do you think I should do?” People in my mastermind, advisors, whoever, “What do you think? I am down to this list of three now, which should I try first?” Get an outside counsel and then go for it.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. It helps get you out of that tunnel vision and out of that, “Oh, I’m really excited about doing one thing because that’d be more fun,” versus the other thing that’ll actually move the needle.  Rob Walling:That’s the thing that… I talk about this all the time, where it’s the ice cream versus spinach. What’s really yummy is ice cream. I want to lose weight, but I want to eat ice cream and not spinach. Those two don’t go together. So, when someone tells me, “I want to grow a SaaS company.” “Great. Here’s my advice,” blah, blah, blah. They’re like, “Oh, but I want to do B2C and I want to launch seven products and see what sticks.” I’m like, “So you want to eat ice cream and think that you’re going to be…” That’s my analogy that I make. Implicit in this question, how do you identify what really moves the needle? Honestly, what moves the needle is often not ice cream. What moves the needle is often not what we want to do, unfortunately. There are examples of folks who did exactly what they want. It’s like the one person who built a social media following, and maybe there’s three. Built a social media following and also just writes a lot of code, and that works. We all want to do that as builders, but usually what moves a needle is not that.  Einar Vollset:Because I mean, the reason everyone’s heard of them is because it’s noteworthy.  Rob Walling:Exceptions.  Einar Vollset:It’s like, holy moly. Look at this guy. He’s on the beach in Thailand and he’s got seven products and they’re making $50,000 each, and it’s working really well. Everyone’s like, “Oh, I’ve got to follow this guy. Look at this.” Well, yeah. But for each one of those guys, there’s 500 people who are running a million ARR, or five million ARR, or 100 million ARR businesses that did nothing of that.  Rob Walling:Yeah. It’s a trip. It is a survivor bias. I’m not taking anything away from people who’ve made that work, but it really reminds me of a rock star or someone who gets into the NBA. Like there’s 500 NBA players, I believe, approximately. It’s like, how many people each year try to get into the NBA? That’s what this feels like. It’s that hit based, you’re decreasing your odds. Those are not the things you should be working on. The blocking and tackling of what we talk about on this podcast, and what we talk about at MicroConf and what I put in my books is-  Einar Vollset:Can you tackle in basketball? Is that allowed?  Rob Walling:I switched metaphors to sports ball, to football.  Einar Vollset:Sports ball.  Tracy Osborn:Nerd.  Einar Vollset:Blocking and tackling in basketball would be hilarious. We should do that.  Rob Walling:We should have full contact basketball.  Einar Vollset:There you go.  Rob Walling:On that note, we are going to wrap up today’s Hot Take Tuesday. Tracy Osborn, you Are Tracy Makes on Twitter, and also one of the folks behind the @TinySeedFund Twitter account, X, Twitter. This is what I’m calling it now, but…  Tracy Osborn:It actually works out pretty well when you say X Twitter, it’s like-  Rob Walling:Like E-X-Twitter.  Tracy Osborn:Exactly. Used to be. Company formerly known-  Rob Walling:Formally known. Yeah.  Tracy Osborn:Because when I say X, it’s like, what are you talking about? So, I keep saying X, Twitter. Einar Vollset, you are Einar Vollset on Twitter, mostly Tweeting about the San Francisco Giants.  Einar Vollset:San Francisco Giants. Who are playing really badly at the moment, but will turn it around.  Rob Walling:It’s possible. It could happen. Thanks you two. Thanks for joining me.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Tracy Osborn:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Tracy and Einar for joining me on the show this week.

And in this week’s episode I’m flying solo to bring you a handful of topics that I think can provide you with some motivation or a framework or even a tactic or a strategy to help you grow your business faster. Most folks who listen to this podcast are bootstrapped or mostly bootstrapped founders. Many of them are starting SaaS companies, but there are also folks across many industries including info products, construction, legal, folks who just want to hear the stories, the guidance, the advice. Topics for today include an update on the The SaaS Playbook, sales numbers, and I have some interesting findings and takeaways from those. I’m not just going to rattle off a bunch of numbers, but give you percentages of what channel sold the most and some learnings that you might be able to take away from those numbers. I’ll be talking about having access to information versus motivation, and I’ll talk about making your first level last. Before I dive into my first topic, I want to encourage you to check out Discretion Capital. So if you’re a SaaS founder and you are approaching seven figures of ARR recurring revenue and you at some point have thought about selling your company, you should reach out to Einar, the founder of Discretion Capital. You’ve heard Einar on this podcast. He is also the co-founder of TinySeed. Discretion Capital is an M\u0026A advisory for B2B, SaaS doing between two and 25 million ARR, and they get amazing multiples. This is what they do for a living is handle this process for you. And the reason I said if you’re approaching a million is usually even if you’re not at two, you want to start thinking about this 6 to 12 months before you sell. You want to get things in order and just understand what the process might be like. You can talk to Discretion. Einar is not a sales guy. He’s not going to push you on stuff. He’ll have a conversation. What is your B2B SaaS business worth? If you’re getting inbound offers already to buy your business, do you need someone who can help give you some advice on what you can do with those? And of course, finding the best buyer for your SaaS. This is where we talk about how once you’re doing 1 or 2 million, you switch from net profit multiples to revenue multiples, and that’s what Discretion Capital does. They are the best in the business at what they do. And of course, I wholeheartedly recommend them, discretioncapital.com, if you want to find out more and schedule a call with Einar. So to start with, this week as I’m recording this, I posted on X, Twitter. I said, well, SaaS Playbook has just sold its 29000th copy and I give thanks to everybody. And by the way, if you’ve purchased a copy or you’ve gifted or recommended it to a friend or you’ve given it a shout-out online, I’m super grateful because that is the number one reason the book continues to sell. And I totally appreciate any word of mouth. If you really think about it, across my audience of say it’s about 125,000 people across YouTube, podcast, email lists, whatever, and that’s trying to de-do. But if you just added them all together, it’s significantly more than that. But trying to actually get to a real number of folks that I can reach, I would figure that I would sell 6 or 7,000 copies of a book. And realistically, the Kickstarter sold somewhere around 3,500 copies I believe. There was another almost a thousand that was there. So it’s like four grand. And then the first month or two after the book was released, it sold another 2,500, 3000 copies. So it is in that range, that 6, 7, 8,000. The reason the book gets to 29,000 copies is because people talk about it. It really is people talking about it on Twitter, on Reddit. Probably a couple of times a week, maybe more I get an alert from all the monitoring that I have set up of someone mentioning it on a podcast again, on Twitter, on Quora, on Reddit, on other platforms. And that’s really what makes a book like this that is self-published and aside from my audience, there is no marketing engine behind it. I guess there’s a few ads on Amazon. You can buy ads there if you have a book or a product you’re selling. But realistically, the reason that it’s about to hit 30,000 is very much because of folks like you who read it, who like it, and who share it. And since we’re a bunch of data nerds, I want to give you this breakdown of copies sold by sales channel because a lot of folks who have never written or self-published a book would’ve no idea. So of all the copies of the SaaS Playbook sold 29,000, 35% of those, just over a third have sold through Amazon, and that’s split evenly, almost 50-50 paperback and Kindle. And realize that Kindle sell for 10 bucks and I get $7 from each of those sales. And then the paperback sells for what? 25 and the printing cost is only a few dollars. And then I think they also take 30% of that, so another 7.50. So I think I get maybe $15 per paperback copy sold. Next up in terms of sales volume is Audible with 26% of the volume. So keep in mind 35% on Amazon, 26% on Audible. Now Audible is brutal. They’re a monopoly and they keep 75% of each sale. So I get 25% for my audiobook that I wrote, produced, recorded, paid to edit. I own the copyright and they are literally just a marketplace where I’m listing it and they’re taking 75%. People complain about Apple’s 30% cut and nobody’s mentioning Audible’s 75% cut. Audible will only take, only in quotes, 60% if you give them exclusive rights to sell your audiobook. But I sell it directly on SaaSplaybook.com as well so you can have DRM free, MP3s and I also only pay 3% to Stripe. And so if you don’t make it exclusive, then they take 75%, which is again, just never ceases to amaze me, but that is what it is. Third in line, Amazon was 35%, Audible was 26, and my Kickstarter was a quarter of the copies, 25%. So I guess at the top of the episode when I said it was only 3, 4,000 copies, it was actually more than that. So you can do the math easily on 25% of 29,000. Next up is 11% have sold directly from SaaSplaybook.com. And if you’re going to buy the electronic version, PDF, EPUB or audio, it helps me out if you go to SaaSplaybook.com. Now, I don’t think of the books as a major revenue stream but it really does make a difference where when I pay Stripe 3% versus paying Audible 75. And finally 1% Apple Books. I question, I think it’s sold 1% of 29,000. So what is that? 250 copies or something? It’s actually less than that. I question if it was even worth the effort to put it up on Apple Books because it did need some specific conversion that I had to pay a designer to do and then posting it, managing it. It’s just kind of an eye roll. It’s kind of interesting how little, I guess Kindle just came in and ate their lunch. I guess that makes sense. So top line sales is best as I can estimate, because some of these platforms like Audible make it really difficult to understand how much you’ve actually sold. But top line revenue is just under 400,000, and my best estimate is paid to me as “royalties” or a percentage of the purchase, about 275,000. So again, I haven’t thought traditionally of books as being a revenue source, but obviously that’s a lot. And that’s a year. Yeah, less than a year since it’s been out. It won’t keep doing that every year, but obviously that is not a trivial amount of money. And finally, the breakdown across formats is 43% audiobook. That’s between Audible and selling from SaaSplaybook.com. So 43% audio, 29% print, that’s paperback and hardcover. And then 28% just below it, almost 50-50, 28% ebook, which is Kindle, PDF and EPUB. So yeah, some of the learnings here are Amazon, really Amazon and Audible, Amazon owns Audible. I mean they have accounted for 60% of the sales. And obviously some of those are from my audience who bought it once it came out, but realistically, they really have a stranglehold on the book industry. And I understand why now, if I was a publisher why I would be concerned because Amazon can throw their weight around it and they can de-list your book or they can put the rankings down if they don’t like you, or they can pull all types of pricing shenanigans. So that’s one learning. Another learning is that if you are going to write a book, obviously having an audience will sell some copies in the early days. And then what leads to recurring sales where every month you’re selling X amount of copies really is having a good book that people want to share. And that’s not something that each of us can snap our finger and make it magically happen, but there is certainly something to be learned about if you’re going to do this, make it really good, don’t half ass this. I see people who hire a ghostwriter to write a book that they pump at the start for a month or two and then it just falls off the face of the earth. And I ask myself, why did you do that? It feels like a huge waste of time. I guess it’s now a resume builder or something to put on LinkedIn or whatever it is. But if I were in your shoes, I would certainly give it my best effort to build something that hasn’t been written before and to make it so good that people want to share it. And a little update on my next book. So I know I’ve talked about the SaaS Launchpad a little bit, which is like the precursor to the SaaS Playbook and it’s early stage ideation, validation and all that. I’m putting that book on ice. It was 75, 80% done. And what we decided to do instead is turn it into a course through MicroConf. So there’s going to be a video course coming out called the SaaS Launchpad, and it’s everything that I know about coming up with ideas and validating them and pre-validating them and building a launch list and all that stuff. And it’s like, I don’t know, 26 videos. It’s very intense. We’re in the middle of editing those now and should be launching that in the fall. If you’re interested in that, be sure to either sign up for MicroConf.com’s email list or you can obviously go to this podcast website, startupsfortheresofus.com, enter your info there and you’ll get The 5 PM Framework, which is something I’ve talked about here as well as two never-before-released podcast episodes that you can only get by signing up for the Startups For the Rest of Us email list. But I am about to wrap, it’s about two weeks from when I’m recording this and we are basically doing a, I call it a code freeze, it’s a manuscript freeze on my next book, which I’m co-authoring with my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling and it is about the psychology and the mindset of selling your company. And it’s thinking through whether you should, the pros and cons. It’s dealing with a pressure cooker that is the process of selling your company. So the before, the during and then the after. I’ve sold, now what? How do I make sure I don’t implode during any of these times? How do I think through the pros and cons of making all these decisions and how do I come out the other side happy and not someone with 5 or 10 million dollars in the bank who is completely miserable? Obviously the content comes from my own experience, my experience counseling and advising founders for years through TinySeed, through MicroConf, and then Sherry’s experience working with hundreds of clients, many of whom have sold or have evaluated selling and have gone through the painful process. And so we have stories and quotes and our own expertise as well. And I hope to be doing some pre-sales for that later this year, maybe November if things work out really well. So stay tuned for more info on that. My next topic for today is a quote that I heard from a running coach. So on Netflix, there is a series called Sprint and it follows runners who are going to the Olympics. It’s 100 and 200 meter runners in the U.S. And both Sherry and I ran track. We actually met on the track in college. And so I love the sport, we both do. And Sprint is an awesome… It’s documentary style where they are following them as they go through the trials and the tribulations. And you can lose a race by two hundredths of a second or three hundredths of a second because your start wasn’t as good and you can be at the top of your game and the former Olympic champion and you can get third because you just don’t perform at the peak all the time. Really good show, highly recommended it. Even if you’re not into running, it’s just one of those things about competing and being exceptional and hard work, luck and skill all coming into play. But one of the most winningest track coaches of all time had this great quote in an episode and he said, at this level, you don’t teach them how to run fast. You teach them how to run fast better. And I like that as a metaphor because really this coach won’t take folks who don’t have the raw material and the sheer speed to be able to be a world champion or have the potential to be an Olympic champion. And similarly imagine if you are evaluating a founder to invest in them or you’re evaluating a potential team member. In a perfect world, you wouldn’t have to teach them how to do their job. You just want to teach them maybe how to do their job better, if that makes sense. Or have them teach you how they should do their job better at your organization. Because any of us can hire a super junior person, you could hire an intern and train them up, and then you do have to teach them how to run fast. And is that okay? Sure it is. But if you’re bootstrapping and you’re hiring your first 10, 15, 20 people and this person doesn’t already know how to do the job and you’re going to train them up from scratch, unless you really, really need to save on budget, that is a case where you are going to spend a lot, lot of time training them unless you have someone on staff who can train them. Again, if you get to 20 people and you have a bunch of senior folks and you hire a junior, yes, one of those senior folks can train them. But if you as a founder are training them on the nuts and bolts of running fast in their role, the basics of customer success, the basics of customer support, if they’re a successful support person, you’re making your job really hard. And this is one of the bigger mistakes that I made in the early days of Drip, is I hired really junior people and it was, I use the excuse that, well, this is all I have money for and I want people to be local. And really to be honest, in Fresno, California there weren’t that many people with the experience that I needed. And especially if I was going to be hiring them and they were a senior customer success person or whatever, probably working for a Bay Area company and making a lot of money. And so there just was no budget for it. But realistically it took a tremendous amount of mine and Derek’s time to train these folks up. And it’s like, do I have regrets about it? I don’t think so. But I think if I were to do it differently, I might’ve hired more remote folks or figured out a way. There are just other ways around it. I know that it was a tremendous amount of time investment at the early stages. And look, I actually love mentoring people. I mean, if you take anything away from me and what I do, there’s a reason I put out 52 podcast episodes a year and now 26 YouTube videos a year. And I’m writing it seems like a book every 18 months is that I do like teaching people. I like passing on what I know. And so doing that in a startup, it was very fulfilling to me. And so I actually did enjoy it but the problem was had jumped out of an airplane. And like Reid Hoffman said, we were putting the parachute together. We were building it as we were falling to the ground. And in that case, you don’t want to also be teaching the person next to you how to build a parachute. You just don’t really have the time. And so if I were to do it all over again, I would probably try to find people who already knew how to run fast so I could teach them how to run fast better. My next topic is having access to information versus the motivation to learn a topic. I think this was a guest on maybe This Week in Startups or it might’ve been the All In Podcast, I am just pretty sure Jason Calacanis was on it. But it was a guest and they were talking about learning to code and how everyone’s going to be able to code because of ChatGPT and developers won’t be needed anymore. And I just don’t believe that’s the case at all. I mean, we’ve seen the same thing with no-code. It’s like you can build some stuff, but we still need developers to build things. And I think for the foreseeable future, when I look out 5 years or 10 years, we will always need builders and makers and I think even beyond that, but of course it’s hard to predict 15, 20 years of what’s going to happen. But the idea here is that learning to code, the hard part used to be it was hard to find information. So when I was eight years old, my parents got me an Apple IIe, me and my brother, and there was one book we got with it and it was called How to Speak Basic to My Apple. And I had learned to speak basic to the Apple because I read through that book and it was painful. You typed in the programs, they called them back then and you made syntax errors and you learned from it. And that’s how I learned to code. And if I had lost that book or the book actually got beat up and lost some pages, it was very hard to find other resources to teach you how to code. But now it’s everywhere. It’s all over. I mean, you can go on a YouTube channel or you can go to any of these teaching platforms like Udemy and Skillshare and you can go to boot.dev, you can go anywhere and you can learn to code for free or for a very low cost, really high quality curriculum. So why hasn’t everyone learned to code? It’s because it’s not about access to information, it’s about the motivation and desire to learn it. And I’m not saying this to imply that, oh, people who don’t learn to code are somehow lesser or they’re not as smart, it is nothing about that. Or they’re unmotivated, nothing like that. I’m just saying each of us has a proclivity towards doing certain things and my mind has always worked mathematically. I love to read. I love to write. I’ve loved math and programming. And other people, they are built differently and can they learn to code? Of course. But do they really want to if you force them to learn the code? My kids are this great example actually where I’m like, no, learn to code. Really, you should learn to code. And here you can make video games and neither of them want to do it, and they just don’t have the desire or the motivation. And we can also say, what about no-code right? Well, no-code you can definitely get more done without grinding. You basically have kind of a prefab house where the walls are all built and the windows are all built and you’re just kind of pushing them in versus when you’re writing code, you’re crafting your own nails and you’re building your own hammer, and then you’re using that to nail in the nails. And when I asked myself, do I think AI is going to make coding so much easier that you don’t have to be motivated to learn? I just don’t think that will happen. I think we will rely on developers who can learn more easily because there’s content out there because AI can teach them. But to maintain the code and to tweak any of the code and to build something really elegant and maintainable, I guess to say that word again, that’s a skill. And some folks will want to do that. Some folks will have the motivation and the desire to do that and others will not. So really what I’m saying here is democratization of information or of training across any discipline, whether it’s code or anything else, does not imply that everyone in the world will soon be doing that. And when I hear folks saying it’s usually the hot take on social media, everyone’s going to learn to code. There will be no jobs, no-code’s going to do it. AI’s going to do it, I just don’t buy it. My next topic stems around a quote from John Romero who is the co-creator of id Software and co-creator of Doom and Quake, several other games. The best audiobook that you can listen to him or I guess there’s a physical copy of that somewhere I’m sure, there’s dead tree versions is called Masters of Doom, and I would highly recommend it. I think it’s certainly my top five audiobooks of all time and maybe my top three, just an amazing, amazing story. But John Romero also has an autobiography called Doom Guy. And while I like that one less, it’s still cool if you want to dive into the lore. But one quote that John Romero said in chapter 27 of Doom Guy is he said, “I always make my first level last.” I really like the sentiment of that. Basically he learns the aesthetic of the game, the feel of the game over time and it develops. And he wants to put his best foot forward by the time he’s getting towards the end of developing or designing the game, he has that all in his head and he knows what it feels like. He knows what the gestalt is, and he can put his best foot forward in that first level. Instead of you imagine building it first and it no longer aligning with things middle of the way down the line. Or you’re kind of rusty, you’re kind of getting the creeks out, and you don’t want that to be your first level because you want the first level to be a banger. And when I heard that, I thought instantly, yeah, this is why we always created our onboarding last when we build SaaS apps is like, I’m going to build the app. What does it need to do? Here are the pages. Even if it’s a very simple MVP or it’s a 1.0. And then we would think, what steps do people need to take to get on board and to get some value? It is a minimum path to awesome within this app. And that’s when we would then go back and architect the onboarding. And it’s the same sentiment here is we already knew how everything worked. We knew the gestalt to the product, the core of it, and we wanted to put our best foot forward. We had worked out the kinks and we wanted to put the tour, whatever we were building, kind of a walkthrough, a thing that prodded you to keep going and get your JavaScript installed and get your first email built and all that. And it really made sense once we had a full picture in our heads of the entire layout of what people needed to do. Now, the interesting thing is I was trying to equate this to marketing too, of like, ooh, write your marketing copy last. Build the app, you’re going to launch it, write the headline after that. I think that’s interesting, I think possibly. The other thing though that I think is really clever and it’s something I’ve done several times, which is we’re going to launch a product. I’m actually going to write the marketing copy first. I’m going to write the headline. I’m going to write all the features, and I’m going to bake that down into a long-form sales page. And write it first then go build that product. And that product might be code or it might be a MicroConf offering like Mastermind Matching or what have you. Then usually I will come back and revise that marketing copy. So in essence, am I writing the marketing copy last? Maybe not technically, but I’m definitely using the knowledge as I’ve worked the kinks out as I fully understand now the gestalt of the product we’re going to launch and I come back and optimize and refine that marketing and the sales copy. Similar to even sales language and sales conversations. If you’re going to be doing demos, obviously you’re going to develop those towards the end of the product development because you have to learn from that. And of course there’s a lot of iteration that has to happen there as well. That’s all we have the time for today. Thank you so much for joining me. If we are not connected on X, Twitter, find me.

I am your host, Rob Walling, and in this week’s episode, I bring Ruben Gamez back on the show to answer Intermediate and advanced listener questions. I made a call for questions on the show and on X/Twitter a few weeks back and asked for questions that weren’t aimed at beginners, at people validating and pre validating and trying to find ideas, and received great questions about how to think through freemium, when should you start to really, really care about brand, revisiting your sales and marketing funnels, SEO in the age of AI, and I couldn’t think of a better person to bring on the show to hammer through these than Ruben Gamez, founder of SignWell. He’s a super knowledgeable, super successful, bootstrapped, and now mostly bootstrapped founder, and I think this episode turned out great. We dug deep into the questions that we answer today. Before we dive in to those questions, I have been hard at work on a video course called the SaaS Launchpad. It’s everything I know today about the early stages. So in contrast to the listener questions we’re going to answer today, this is about coming up with ideas, how to pre validate, how to validate, how to build a launch list, and all types of things that you’ll experience in the early stage. And this video course is going to go live here in the next couple of months, but if you want to get on the list and be the first to hear about it, as well as receive a bonus if you buy the course early, you can head to SaaSLaunchpad.co. I’m actually really stoked about this course, it’s everything I know about how to get those things done. And I’ve teased on the podcast a few times that I have a mostly written book on this topic, and basically have sidelined that. And I took all that content and turned it into this video course where I felt it is much more easily consumed and I think it will be more effective for folks. So SaaSLaunchpad.co, if you’re interested. And with that, let’s dive into listener questions. Ruben Gamez, welcome back to the show.  Ruben Gamez:Thanks for inviting me.  Rob Walling:Always great to have you, man. Really good listener questions today. I keep calling them … I’m trying to figure out the name. These are intermediate or later stage questions, because it’s not about idea validation and building an MVP. And the reason I wanted to have you on is there’s a bunch of questions I feel like are right in your wheelhouse, things like freemium, SEO. I don’t know, there’s a few others, so it’s a really good docket today. And our first question is from MicroConf attendee and man about Twitter, Val Sopi.  Val Sopi:Hey, Rob. Val Sopi here, founder of Blogstatic. Thanks so much for everything you do for us bootstrappers with your podcast, the MicroConf Conference, and now TinySeed. My question is about freemiums, as Blogstatic is a B2P product and I’m looking for ways to grow faster. After listening to episode 717 with Marie Martens of Tally and how they’ve succeeded with their freemium approach, I started to think about how freemium could work for Blogstatic. My biggest concern is fighting spam, as Blogstatic is a front-facing app and not something companies use internally. This means I have to comply with my hosting provider’s rules and having content on my service that doesn’t comply could get me in trouble. Yes, I can use AI, but I currently don’t have the time to re-engineer the sign-up flow as I’m fully focused on sales and outreach. The goal is to have a generous free plan, so it’s not just a gimmick, with premium features requiring an upgrade. By now I know which features trigger an upgrade, so I think I can create a useful free plan that doesn’t hinder growth. The purpose of this would not be to convert more free users, as they don’t convert as much, but to use the freemium model so more people talk about Blogstatic and it becomes known as the go-to solution for blogs. With all that said, my specific question is this, should I do it? And if so, what’s the best way to tackle this? The only way it would make sense is if it helps Blogstatic grow 10X from here, which means $200,000 ARR. Otherwise, it would be an added burden for me and the business. And when I say 10X growth, I don’t mean the freemium alone doing that, but hoping at least it would assist the other outreach efforts I’m currently undertaking such as social, SEO, paid ads, and direct outreach. It’s worth mentioning that Blogstatic is already a super low cost product starting at $19 per year, with a fully featured plan at $49 per year, which most customers buy. At the time of this recording, there are 430 active paid accounts bringing about $20,000 in ARR almost two years in come October. Year-over-year growth is at 200%. Visits to trial are 10%, and trial to pay are whopping 26%. Year-over-year retention is not that great at only 56%. Thanks again, Rob, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.  Rob Walling:For those listening, Blogstatic is everything you need to run a professional blog, no code, fully customizable, SEO ready, this is his H1 and H2 obviously fast loading, fully featured, and as he said in the voicemail, it is a very low-priced tool. What do you think?  Ruben Gamez:I think we mostly think about this in the same way. Usually if you’re bootstrapping, it’s a tough way to go. I almost default to no freemium unless there’s an opportunity here. So I think … I was recently talking to a friend about this. There’s a side to where your business needs to be the right type of business where freemium can work, and the space, and we’ve talked a little bit about this before, to where if you have a high support app or a high cost app to serve customers, then it’s going to be really tough to do freemium. If you have an app to where it has some viral component or not even that, beyond that, if people using it in some way, shape or form make it better or easier for you to convert other people, whether they expose other people to the product or they create content and that content can get you more traffic or whatever it is, there’s something there that Brian Balfour talks a lot about growth loops, it creates a growth loop there. Then that has potential. It has to be big enough, the space needs to be usually big enough, if you’re doing true freemium. One of the things that I think a lot of people overlook when it comes to evaluating freemium is whether there’s an opportunity in the space for it. Meaning if everyone in the space or a lot of people in the space are offering freemium already and you’re just going to be one of those, then what makes yours different? What makes yours special? Why are people going to talk about it or promote it or anything, especially if you’re new coming in. So I think that’s one of the underrated things that people don’t look at. If no one is offering freemium and then you see at the low end there’s an opportunity there and there’s some sort of almost demand, then that’s potential, I think, in that situation. The other thing is not just creating freemium, you have to promote it too. You have to do something. It’s not just create the free plan and then you put it out there and that’s it, you’re done. It’s not going to get picked up because of it, just because you have something that’s free. So there are multiple things in here that I’d take a look at.  Rob Walling:Cool. So you’ve set the stage of freemium, and what I like is you have these criteria and it’s like if most or all of these are not present, it’s probably not worth it. Like you said, you default, I know, with bootstrappers because freemium kicks revenue down the line, and when you’re bootstrapping, revenue is just so critical because you need it to survive, you need it to market. If you had buckets of money in the bank, you raise half a million, $5 million, whatever, you can kick revenue down the line because you have that bucket of money. But when you’re bootstrapping, it’s riskier. And I like that you pointed out it’s not just “Go freemium,” and it just markets itself. Even we were talking about how Marie from Tally was on the show a couple of months ago, and how they had a free plan, but she sent thousands of DMs, cold DMs and warm DMs to get people to use it. How did you … I guess your freemium with SignWell, the marketing of it is the SEO engine you’ve built.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, that’s a big part of it, but we’ve also been deliberate with certain segments that we have to where we’ve actually gone into communities and promoted the freemium plan and actually in some cases given a different version of the free plan to where we’re giving away more because we know it works in those communities and it just helps overall. So you have to be deliberate about it, you can also just run the math and know, okay, if you’re planning on saying that, “Because we have this powered buy or we have some other thing that’s going to expose people to our product and that’ll help create some of the word of mouth, some visits that will eventually convert,” things like that, then you could just run the math and see, “How many of these websites do we need? How many of those pages need to be out there?” and then “What, roughly speaking, will be the conversion rate? And then from those, how many of those will be free?” And you start to see that you need really big numbers, a lot of times, to make freemium work. It gets tricky in that when you just run the math.  Rob Walling:Absolutely. And you have big numbers, Tally had big numbers. It was 100 … I forget. It was a lot. And then the conversion rate was low. And same with Dropbox. Anybody who’s ever talked about this, it’s like 2% every year convert to paid and 3% … It’s some number I typically hear in that range, I’m sure it can be higher or lower. But something that Val’s asking about is he’s saying, “I’m not really looking to convert the free users. I’m trying to do this so word spreads so that more people talk about it so that it becomes the de facto.” I’m not sure how I feel about that. What do you think about it?  Ruben Gamez:So we did a little bit of that. I’m okay with that approach as long as you understand what you’re looking for. So you can’t say, “Well, in a year we’ll know whether this is working or not.” That’s just way too long. But there are things, especially a lot of times people just look at MRR or the number of people who converted to a paid plan or whatever, something that’s more of almost a lagging indicator in a lot of ways. And you can look at things that are early predictors of whether this is working. So one of the things that we looked at a lot the earlier days, for freemium, was our branded searches, “Are those increasing?” And even basics. The basics of, “Are people using the free plan?” If they’re not using the free plan, then it doesn’t matter how many sign-ups you’re getting, if the usage on it is low, if the repeat usage on it is low, then it’s probably not going to work. If you’re seeing … Even if you just have a form, on your sign-up form, if you have a field that says, “How did you hear about us?” and you start to collect a little bit of that and you’re like, “Oh, okay, we’re starting to see it pick up.” So something that I saw a long time ago that I really liked from Sean Ellis back in the day, remember when he bought KISS Insights from Heaton? And he renamed it Qualaroo. And it was already freemium, and I had a conversation with Sean at the time because we were from time to time talking about freemium, and he told me that he didn’t think the freemium was aggressive enough, so he wanted to test that. So then he took three months, and I really liked his approach. He said, “The next three months, I’m just going to open it up heavy.” He did that and then he just looked at not the conversion numbers or anything, but at other signals that told him that this is starting to work. Not that it worked, but, “This is actually starting to have the impact that I think.” And he didn’t see the impact that he wanted, and then after three months, he just went the other way. He stopped freemium completely and raised prices, just as I said, the other direction.  Rob Walling:I like what you’re saying here, which is, “Hey, you can’t wait a year to see if it’s going to work. You have to have these early signals, and do you know what signals you’re looking for?” Right?  Ruben Gamez:Exactly.  Rob Walling:And in Val’s case, I think something that’s … I’m a little worried about, is he said, “My goal is to have a generous free plan so it’s not just a gimmick, where any premium features require an upgrade.” So how much is this going to cannibalize … His existing revenue is not a ton. I think he said it’s $20,000 ARR, but if that cuts your MRR in half, this is what we’re talking about, it’s a struggle, with bootstrapping, if you need that revenue. What do you think? Separate from freemium, I don’t know, Val. Val and I, I met him at MicroConf Europe in Lisbon, so I feel like I’m talking to him directly, but what do you think of him just 5X-ing his pricing? Because right now it’s $20 a year, $50 a year, $100 a year. And I want to see $100, $250 and $500, or even $100, $500 and $1000, and just figuring out what you have to add to make that work. Just make the pricing change, see what happens to the business. Doesn’t sound like it’s growing like wildfire as it is. I know Val’s working on it, but will anyone sign up? If it cuts it to zero for a month or for two weeks, it’s like, “Okay, I did the experiment,” but then also, “What can I build to make this worth it?” And what other options are people using? Do I have to be this cheap because it’s a commodity space and there’s a bunch of other options and I really need some differentiator? But I almost personally … if he wants to kickstart growth, I think of going in that direction rather than freemium. What do you think?  Ruben Gamez:Right. If we’re talking about speeding up how quickly he’s growing, then we just know that companies that basically charge more money tend to grow the fastest. And you’ve mentioned this about TinySeed companies and the patterns that we’ve seen in the recent survey about SaaS as well, and just from founders that I know, the ones that charge more tend to grow much faster. So I do like that. But I think you’re right. It’s really easy just to say, “Well just raise prices,” and sometimes that works because so many founders under-price. But if you entered the market as a certain type of product and cost savings is a big part of it, or it being cheaper, it might not be that straightforward to just raise prices because we have a little bit of this problem as far as if we decided to kill freemium and raise our prices, there are a lot of references over on the internet and a lot of different places that basically push us as a really great free e-sign tool, a good alternative at 20% the price of DocuSign or whatever. So if we were to do that with SignWell, we’d have to account for that and have a strategy for it. I like how you paired, yes, raising prices, but also changing the product, maybe changing some of the positioning and accounting for some of that stuff, like the expectations of the existing traffic that you have coming in. And it’s easy to say, “Well, the price increases didn’t work,” and it might just be because the people who are coming into your website are expecting something and you’re not matching up with that. And that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. It just means that if you’re going to do it, you’re also going to want to have a way to bring in the people that have the right types of expectation on the pricing side.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. So to answer his ultimate question, if you were in his shoes, would you try freemium the way he’s proposing it?  Ruben Gamez:I would look to see if there was opportunity to feed the freemium engine. If I saw an opportunity and a way to get big numbers, then I would experiment three or six months like Sean did, and really look for some of those signals and then be decisive. If I’m not liking what I’m seeing, shut that down and then go in the other direction that we were just talking about and know that yes, if we position our product to where people that are coming in are expecting really low-priced products, then I’ll raise prices, but it’s also probably going to take time to correct that.  Rob Walling:And you were saying if there was a big volume of potential top of funnel, typically SEO, right?  Ruben Gamez:Right. Yep.  Rob Walling:You heard it here first, folks. That is Ruben’s recommendation for Val Sopi. So I think if you were to ask me, because you just know so much more about freemium than I do, having been doing it for the past several years. I have secondhand exposure to it through you and other TinySeed companies that do it, and other TinySeed companies that have shut it down because it’s not working or have had to adjust it. And my gut … I think I already made my recommendation. If I were in his shoes, I would do the price increase. And as you said, it comes with positioning. There’s a bunch of stuff that comes with that. It’s not just as simple as, “Oh, raise your prices,” and it fixes it magically. But that would be my own personal leaning. So thanks for that question, Val. Hope it was helpful. Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted senior results-oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor, Lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it, listener Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with Lemon.io, “The machine learning engineer they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results.” And longtime listener Chaz Yoon hired a senior developer from Lemon.io and said his hire “definitely knew his stuff, provided appropriate feedback and pushback and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations.” Chaz said he’d definitely use Lemon.io again when he’s looking for a senior-level engineer.

And Josh responded to that and he says, “When do you start to really, really, really care about brand?” And I like this question because 12, 15 years ago, I would’ve said, “If I’m doing SaaS, I don’t really need to worry about brand because I build a tool that gets in the way of traffic of people who need the tool. And if the tool does the thing they need, like the long tail keyword tool or the invoicing tool or whatever, I have SEO, I have ads, I have whatever else, and that’s it. No one’s buying it because of my brand.” That was when I was a young wide-eyed early stage … it was someone who had a bunch of little six-figure businesses, some five-figure, and I didn’t really need brand. And then I started realizing, “Oh, Startups For the Rest of Us is a brand, MicroConf is a brand, Drip became a brand, TinySeed obviously is a brand. There’s the books, SaaS Playbook becomes a brand.” And I realized the power of that. And branding always turned me off because every book you read about branding, every example, it’s Colgate toothpaste and it’s Intuit. And I was just like, “Well, I’m not that. I don’t give a (beep) about this.” But what I’ve realized is that, even people in our space, is the bootstrappers that get to that, I don’t know where, sometimes it’s mid to high six-figures, sometimes it’s at low millions or whatever. But you do start to get a concept you introduced me to where Jason Lemkin calls it a mini brand, where you’re not a brand like Target or Colgate, I guess, but people know your name and people are talking about you on the internet, on Reddit, on Quora, in private Slack groups. And the moment that your product is being referenced by name, that’s when you start having a brand, because what are they saying about you? That is your brand. I like to think of brand being what people say about you when you’re not in the room. And by you, I mean your product. Like you were saying earlier, SignWell, in some forums, in certain spaces, it’s, “Oh, it’s a really great alternative and it’s a fifth of the price.” Well, that’s part of the brand. And whether you controlled that and did it intentionally or not, that just becomes part of the brand. So with that preamble, what are your thoughts on when should you really, really, really start caring about brand?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, this super interesting topic, I think a lot of it depends on how you interpret the question and how you even interpret brand, really. I would normally … in the way that a lot of people talk about brand and interpreting the question to mean, “When do you spend a significant amount of money, time, energy on things that are not meant to directly convert customers?” I would in the past, a lot of times just say, “When you have no idea on how to spend your money.” More of a hot take, when you don’t know what you’re doing.  Rob Walling:Zing.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. I like the examples that you brought up with TinySeed and MicroConf and things like that. I think those are way more practical, and I would really ask you, because I think of these as very significant brands, the brands in the spaces in which they’re operating in, but you didn’t do this with VC funding or anything like that. So from a very practical point of view, how much time, energy, and money did you spend on activities that had to do with the brand versus other things that got you in front of audiences, got you customers or the people that you were intending to get?  Rob Walling:It’s an interesting question because since it’s not SaaS … If I was running a SaaS company, you are focused on generating leads, closing deals, marketing funnels, and this and that. So the majority of your time, for me, it was always product or marketing, sales. MicroConf is a brand because we have 724 episodes of this podcast. And if you say, “Oh, it only took me an hour per episode,” so that’s 724 hours over the last 10 years. It’s been a lot more than that. I think it’s like building the audience built the brand, and this is what I recommend people don’t do. If you’re going to build a SaaS company, don’t build an audience, build your network and build marketing channels, not a brand.  Ruben Gamez:In a very similar way, I’ve talked about it before as far as brand, you build the brand as you build the business, as you build your customer base, as you get your email list and all this stuff, your brand is built. But that’s a very different thing than what some people refer to or think about when they’re thinking about investing in the brand.  Rob Walling:Like hiring an expensive designer and redoing the positioning and the copy and-  Ruben Gamez:And spending a whole bunch of time on that sort of thing.  Rob Walling:… media company, “I’m going to start a YouTube channel and a podcast because that’s what brands do,” that type of stuff? That’s not a good use of your time in the early days, there’s no chance. So I like what you just said. You build the business and the business builds the brand, and that is exactly what happened with MicroConf and with Drip and, well, TinySeed was able to piggyback on my existing brands, but think about each of these. MicroConf, the entire focus … MicroConf was just a landing page. Take a step back. You said earlier, is it brand building or is it direct response in it, direct conversion? Those are the two types of marketing most people throw around. MicroConf started as a landing page. I have a screenshot of this black background. Dark mode before dark mode was a thing, because it was 14 years ago, and it had some headshots of Heaton Shaw and Noah Kagan and myself and Mike Tabor, and it was an email capture form. And it said, “Come to this play in Vegas on this date,” that’s all it was. It was direct response. And then we tried to sell tickets to that email list and tried to sell enough tickets that we could then afford to pay for the venue. There was no brand building and in fact there was no logo. The MicroConf was some font and we just typed “Microconf” on a thing. We sold tickets to the event first. To me, that’s building the business. We ran an event, we showed up, we executed, we operated. None of that was brand building. You know what built the brand the most? Was running a really (bleep) good event. And we got lucky with that. We didn’t know what we were doing, but we just put … You remember. You remember how stressed I was, and I was putting … I was like, “This has to be the best event I’ve ever attended.” So I was stressed about it and it turns out it was a really good event. And I think that alone, that created word of mouth and that created the brand of, “Oh, Microconf is a new thing and it’s different than anything else.” So what does that mean for SaaS founders? What does that mean for them?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. Well, I think there are a couple of times when you start to invest more in things that are less related to directly building the business and directly converting customers and things like that. And you might spend in areas to where it’s thought of as brand building or enhancing the brand or whatever. If you’re in a really commoditized space and brand is how you get customers, that is it. Or as you get more and more established with the brand, you went back and you redesigned things and all … Right? Once-  Rob Walling:Oh, yeah. Like MicroConf, all that stuff. But that was when we were doing almost a million dollars in revenue through the business and had tens of thousands of people on an email list. And to your point, we built the business and then went back and designed a logo. The videographer every year would say, “Oh, can you send me your logo so I can put it in the videos?” And we were like, “We don’t have a logo.” It is weird in retrospect. I probably should have gotten a logo design before-  Ruben Gamez:A little bit earlier than that?  Rob Walling:Six years, seven years in. But to our point, you can build a business. We didn’t spend time building Drip’s brand. We didn’t spend time. We had a Derek who’s a full stack developer who designed the first logo, and I did hire a designer to put the colors together, but it was nothing … It was just, “Let’s make it look neat. Let’s make it look nice and attractive and make the UX great.” And my whole goal was to get people into it because I guess reinforcing once again that … What I found is the more customers we had, the wider our brand got by default. Because again, I define it as, “Hey, people talking about you when you’re not in the room.” That’s not the definitive version of brand, but it’s a big part of it, I think. And the more people who used it who said, “Oh, this is so much better than the other tools,” “Oh and it’s less expensive and it’s better? Whoa!” That became part of the brand. Is that how you think about it too with SignWell? Because obviously you have tens of thousands of users.  Ruben Gamez:Yes, that’s exactly how I think about it. Building the brand is just getting known in a space, and the amount of time that we put into the brand is not that much, really. It’s really mostly because there’s just so much room. If you’re in a space where you have a lot of room to grow still in the market, there’s so many other things that we could spend that time, money, and energy on than brand, still. And I think a lot of SaaS products are in that space. Even Josh, he’s got a significant business, he’s super sharp, he’s in a space to where he’s at a good level of revenue and growth and all that, but there’s probably still a lot of space ahead of them to go. So the thing that we do, it’s always about, how are we best going to use the resources that we have, the money, time and energy? And mostly for most companies, it just makes more sense to invest on growing the business and building the brand that way, I feel like.  Rob Walling:I would agree, especially with SaaS. I can make not even a counter argument, but an auxiliary to that, of, but if you’re building a conference or a creator-type business where you’re creating video and you’re more, “We really are information marketer,” and you are more of a Rob Walling or a MicroConf or a TinySeed, none of those are SaaS companies, I would say the brand can be important. I think it’s more important, probably, for those, because people have to know and trust you to buy in, but SaaS is a tool solving a problem. And yes, brand can have an impact on that, but as you said, where do you rank that in terms of priority? And usually it’s going to be pretty low for me until I really feel the need. I think people use it as an excuse to start a “media company,” because brand is fun. I like printing T-shirts with my logo and witty slogans, and I want to be … It’s fun, but that doesn’t move the needle.  Ruben Gamez:And it’s not measurable, it’s not a lot of times. So it’s easy for people to spend time there and effort and just be like, “Oh, I’m doing something, you can’t measure everything.” They tend to have this attitude of, “It’s all or nothing,” but it’s not really all or nothing. And just because you’re building the business doesn’t mean you’re completely ignoring the brand, right?  Rob Walling:Right. And that’s the thing. And I’m the person who, the moment I start a new thing, I print T-shirts with logos on them, but I will 100% say to anyone I’m talking to, “This is not the best use of this energy right now, but it’s a luxury that I have and a thing I want to do”. And to me it’s like eating ice cream, and I’m going to eat ice cream sometimes. It is not necessarily that … I should eat spinach all the time, but sometimes I’m going to eat ice cream. To me, some branding is really fun for me. And I do remember, I will say when we launched TinySeed, the first website, not … there was a landing page that I threw together in a couple of weeks, but the first website, I invested some money into it because I wanted it to be really, really sharp. I want it to look really good and feel very professional and right in line. Now is your visual identity your brand? No, but it is a component of that. It’s a component of how people view it. Anything I would launch these days, I would want to look really, really good. And again, it’s not identical with brand, but the brand of the SaaS Playbook, the yellow cover with that design, it stands out. So I don’t want people to listen to this thinking that you and I don’t care about brand or think brand is unimportant because we both know that it is, but it’s that caution of, “Don’t get too stuck in it. Don’t do it too early.” It’s not the best use of most entrepreneurs’ time. So thanks for that question, Josh. Hope it was helpful. Next question is from Lane at Boot.dev. He is wagslane on X/Twitter. He says, “Which parts of your sales and marketing funnels do you revisit most often, and on what frequencies? For example, only myself and one other team member work on marketing stuff and we can only get around to landing pages, drip campaigns, onboarding, sequence copy, et cetera, every so often.” How do you think about this?  Ruben Gamez:So I guess I think about it in a different way. If I’m thinking about growth, I don’t tend to think about, “Okay, what are the parts of my sales funnels and marketing funnels, and is it time to revisit those?” I think about it more in terms of, “What type of growth are we looking to get? What are the bottlenecks? Where are the opportunities for that growth?” and then focus in those areas. So that could mean that there are certain parts of funnel that we just don’t look at very often or almost ever, because they’re not the bottleneck, they’re working really well in other areas. Again, it’s really about efficiently using the limited time and money that we have. And usually that means just going after the biggest opportunities and focusing there.  Rob Walling:I think of it the same way you do. I remember I would launch … We’re going to launch SaaS app and I’m like, “I’m going to do some stuff manually and then I know I need at least an email sequence for onboarding and I need a landing page and some copy,” and I would just crank out in a day all of that stuff. And it was very much V0.9. It was not great, but it was 75% of what it needed to be, and we would launch with that. Then I would at some point make the time to circle back. I would either see conversions were really low or I would see a flag in my funnel where I’m like, “I’m off here, so what’s happening?” And I would go back and I’d reinvest in it. But then I remember leaving the onboarding sequence alone for a year or 18 months, the email onboarding, and I’m sure it could … needed an update. I’m sure it was crafty by the time I got back to it, but it wasn’t the most pressing thing. It wasn’t a bottleneck. And conversion from onboarding and trial to paid were also high for us, that I just didn’t circle back to it even though it wasn’t the best and it got outdated and all this. So I think you and I think about it the same way where I’m trying to do the most pressing thing and rather than it being, “Oh, in a perfect world every three months I would revisit all this stuff and I would optimize it.” I don’t know that that’s the best way to do it, or at least in the way I work on things. I’m always thinking, “What’s the biggest bottleneck? What’s the most broken or will provide the most results?” And sometimes that’s revamping an old thing and sometimes it’s doing a new thing. Often it feels like it’s doing a new thing if I think it can work.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. Especially the earlier you are, and the more you have to increase numbers, usually it’s not about optimizing existing things, it’s about just getting more into the funnel and often that means doing new stuff.  Rob Walling:So thanks for that question, Lane. I feel pretty good about that answer. We’ll move on to the next question from Anders.  Anders:Hi, Rob. My name is Anders and I’m the co-founder of ShopLevers, a data analysis and aggregation tool for business coaches who work with auto repair shop owners. Until now, we’ve grown primarily through outbound efforts and word of mouth. We are looking to expand our offering beyond coaches and sell directly to shop owners. As that market is much larger, I’ve thought about basing the top of my funnel around SEO and content. I don’t have much experience in digital marketing and I found myself hesitant to get started. It seems like AI could be changing the playbook that has worked well for others. Am I overthinking this? Do you foresee a moment in the not too distant future where people abandon their search habits? Are you adjusting any of your own marketing strategies for this new reality? Thanks for all you do, listening to your podcast is a highlight of my week.  Rob Walling:So this is another question where I really wanted to get your take on it. How are you thinking about it? Because you are one of the founders in the world I know who knows the most about SEO and who also has a lot to lose if SEO goes away, because it’s such a big component of SignWell’s success. So how are you thinking about this?  Ruben Gamez:It’s funny, I don’t think we’ve ever really talked about it, so I’m interested to hear your take as well. So I think in the near term future, yeah, it’s worth doing. SEO takes time, so it’ll take a few months, but I don’t see this going away in a few months, so there’s no real danger there. I think there was something that I saw recently on Twitter, this founder of an SEO agency that … I think Will Reynolds is his name. And he talked about … he said something like, he won’t write content nowadays. He won’t write content. And I think this is a little extreme, but the thinking is interesting and I think it’s in the right direction in some cases as far as where to put your time and energy when it comes to SEO and how to think about the future. It’s going to have an impact, it already is starting to have an impact, but the way that he put it was, if AI can write it, he won’t write it, basically is what he said. Which is, if you think about that, there are already a lot of things that you could just type in, “Write me this,” into an AI and it can create an article that just … the feel might be a little bit like, “Oh, this is written by AI,” in some cases or whatever, but it’s essentially the same information. It’s very close to what a lot of people are already putting out there. So if that’s the majority of your content, or somebody else, Ian Howells as well, he does a lot of stuff in the SEO space, Traffic Think Tank, he’s one of the founders there. I like the way that he’s put it in the past and it’s just more of the same, which is, if you can just hire writers, like an agency, like a generic writer, an SEO writer, a writer to create and just list out a bunch of topics and then have them without knowing anything about your space or without knowing anything about your business, just create those articles, shoot them out really quick, then you don’t really have anything that’s defensible or really that valuable there. The more you can move away from just content like that and tools, that’s why engineering as marketing, you still have to promote it, you still have to build tools, but things that people are searching for that are not just basic, especially “How to this,” or whatever, more and more of that stuff’s going to be answered by AI. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it initially, just know maybe you invest less time on that sort of stuff if there’s an opportunity there and you can rank and you can get traffic in the near future, but then devote more of your time towards other more unique content or tools or resources.  Rob Walling:Yeah. I like that advice a lot. And I agree with you. In the near term, AI is not going to kill SEO, but if we look out years, is it going to have a major impact? It’s obviously going to have an impact. There’s another potential impact of AI on SEO, and it’s the thought that Google, when you go type a search term into it now, above the fold is an AI answer. There are not 10 blue links anymore. It’s a big wall of text for most things, then it’s all you’re sponsored … your AdWords, and then it’s organic. And I wonder if Anders is not referencing that, of, what if all the 10 blue links, what if you went to Google homepage and you type in a search and all it is an AI answer? There are no 10 blue links anymore, they’re completely gone.  Ruben Gamez:I think for some terms, it’s already … there are few terms that are basically like that already.  Rob Walling:So what does that do, then? So how do you survive in that case if you’re so reliant on being one of those links that people click through? My impression was that, how does Google create the answers? Well, they do it by scanning the top 10 blue links, probably. They do the whole internet, but you get the idea, and they’re giving answers from that material, but then you don’t get the click through. So is it stealing clicks from your site that could potentially convert? What do you think about it?  Ruben Gamez:I think this has already been going on. Really, they’ve had that. It wasn’t AI, but they’ve basically given you the answers, and they had-  Rob Walling:The zero click box at the top, right?  Ruben Gamez:Right. So for some content, that game’s been over for a while, for certain types of content. More and more, there are just a higher percentage of zero click searches that have been happening. But there are other types of content where that’s not enough. Just going back to where you focus your time, and I’m going to focus more of my time on those types of things. And that’s if we’re talking about things that people are searching for. So you still have paid, you can do AdWords still, and they need to make money. So in the short term, at least in the next couple of years, I don’t think they’re going to just instantly … they need a replacement for that. In some way, shape or form, they’re making a ton of money off of a lot of companies and people, and what would they be as a business if they just got rid of that? They give that ability for people to get in front of searchers by paying.  Rob Walling:Right, 78% of Google’s revenue is AdWords. That’s the whole company, basically. To your point that they’ll … So you were saying that SEO is going to change, but people will still search for stuff. This is what I was saying the other day. They’ll still search, so there’s still ads. You know what else? People are also going to search … they’re either going to search on Reddit or get redirected to Reddit. They’re going to search on Quora if that’s even still a thing. I always mention it, but it’s less important these days. They’re going to search in whatever private Slack groups, so that’s where word of mouth is a little more important. They’re going to find stuff in Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange type sites. It’s spreading, it’s getting towards maybe not so concentrated in Google. I know that when I search a lot of stuff that I search, the top result are Reddit threads, especially when I’m looking for … if I’m not using AI and I’m looking for answers around any type of hobby thing that I do, like tabletop games, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, playing the guitar and that kind of stuff, Reddit’s up there. And there are Reddit ads and there are … whatever, there’s a bunch of approaches. So I think that piggybacks maybe on what you’re saying in that SEO is going to change, but there are still … it’s not like it’s going to go away overnight and AdWords, specifically, is still going to be around for quite some time and that there are other options there for you.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. And showing up in those places, finding a way to show up in all those places that you mentioned is a good approach. Even if you’re creating … a lot of people treat SEO as like, “I have to create all the content myself, and I have to rank that content.” But a lot of times you get really good results by showing up in content, in places, communities, forums, other articles, whatever, that you didn’t create. And I think the more you can do that, the more likely it is also that you’ll show up in some of the AI-written answers because they’re picking it up from more references they see. You’re obviously meaningful in some way, so you’re worth mentioning as well.  Rob Walling:Right. If I would’ve typed, “Best email marketing tool for realtors,” and there’s probably going to be a bunch of top 5, top 10, top 20 posts, or it’ll be a Reddit thread or a Quora thread of what’s the best. And it’s like, “Well, how do I get in those?” That’s exactly what I was going to say, was AI is scraping those and using them for answers. So if you go to ChatGPT or Google’s equivalent, is it Gemini? Is that what Google’s-  Ruben Gamez:Gemini, yep.  Rob Walling:… AI thing is? And Baird is someone else’s? I haven’t kept up-  Ruben Gamez:Plexity, just the other day I looked up and in the last 30 days, we’ve gotten … not a ton, it was 40 or something like that, unique visitors from Perplexity, which was interesting.  Rob Walling:So that’s it, it’s what we’re saying. It’s crawling those, and then if I go into ChatGPT or any of these tools and say, “What is the best email service provider for realtors?” that’s where they’re getting the info. So it’s changing, and that means for incumbents who are getting a lot of traffic from it, they might see their business slowly get squeezed out. And for upstarts, there’s probably opportunity here because it’s shifting. When you have this type of paradigm shift, this is when you can figure out, you can be at the bleeding edge of it, of, “Well, how do you get mentioned in all these AI answers?”  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. I think it’s also harder to make SEO, and this game has also been over for a little while, making it the only way in which you grow your business. Not just your primary, it should be thought of more as supplementary. So in the affiliate space, they’re freaking out right now because a lot of sites have been hit and are doing poorly because they don’t really have a business model. There are no products. So it’s funny in a way, they’re going about it almost in the reverse way. They’re like, “Okay, now we have these sites that are content, they’re getting traffic. We need a product on here so that Google likes it so that it’s not just a content site or whatever.” So they’re trying to come up with products, but in what we do inherently, we sell products, and we have content tools or resources or whatever that help us get traffic. So we already have that problem solved, but it speaks to just that thinking about, it’s more of a supplementary thing and it’s not a bad idea to diversify a little bit. Not a ton, because in reality it’s going to be one channel or two channels that are going to work really best for you, and you can’t spread yourself out too thin. But it does pay to invest some time and money into something else and experiment with other stuff.  Rob Walling:So thanks for that question, Anders. I hope our answer was helpful.

One landed as a six, you picked that one up and said, “Well, this is my thing,” and you don’t know why it worked. And that is the biggest issue is if you don’t gain the experience and the skill to actually build the business and grind through the hard parts to get to the good parts, then you don’t necessarily have that knowledge on how to fix the things that break. Welcome back to Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m your host, Rob Walling, and this is the podcast that is shipped every week since 2010 for 720 something episodes focused on helping folks who want to bootstrap and mostly bootstrap amazing companies. If you’re listening to this podcast, you probably want to change your life or the life of those around you, but you are not hell-bent on begging venture capitalists for money and trying to make a dent in the universe or change the world, at least not with your first effort and the effort that you’re probably focused on, if you’re listening to this podcast. Do the lessons on this podcast apply to folks building SaaS companies? Absolutely, and that is the main focus. Do they also apply to folks building media companies, content companies, info product, course companies, frankly construction companies, all types of businesses? Yeah, a lot of them do and I have folks who I meet in person or who write in and let me know that they have no plans of ever launching a SaaS startup, and yet, they listen to this podcast to get learnings and the thought process from myself and other successful entrepreneurs. So if you are here, you belong here. Thanks for joining me. This week, I am diving into listener questions. I made a request on X/Twitter for more advanced questions, and so I don’t want to call these late stage questions because they’re certainly not all focused on seven or eight-figure businesses, but I wanted to get away from just answering a lot of questions about validation, and how do I find an idea, and how do I pick an idea, and how do I build an MVP, and those are fine questions, but when that’s all that’s coming in, it gets a little tiring and it’s less helpful for folks who are further along. I really do want this podcast and all the content that I put out to help folks who are in early stages, but also in the medium and late stages, seven and eight-figure companies and it’s easy to get pulled in the direction of focusing on early stage because that is the majority of the audience in any entrepreneurial audience, 80%, 90% of the people are early stage. It’s just the way the numbers work out, but I want to continue to have this podcast focus across the lifecycle of building your company. So today, I’m answering some more, I don’t know, intermediate questions, I don’t know, intermediate, late stage, whatever we want to call them, from a handful of folks who sent in audio, video and then a couple written questions, and I still have a backlog after this of another, I think, 25 more advanced questions. And so, I’m really excited to dig into those in the coming months. Before we get into questions, I wanted to let you know that MicroConf Europe is almost sold out. This year, MicroConf Europe is in lovely and amazing Dubrovnik, Croatia, it’s October 6th through the 8th, and our pricing for tickets goes up again on August 15th. So get your ticket today to save $200. And with that, let’s dive into my first question. As a reminder, audio and video questions go to the top of the stack.  Speaker 2:Hey Rob, big fan of the show and also the Slack community. My question is about managing managers. I run a software company in Germany and we’re around 25 people now and just hired the first two managers. One person in marketing that has three to four people under her and another leader running a product line with two people under her, and I am no newbie to managing ICs, but managing managers or leadership team is new to me. So what’s something that you focus on to A, not undermine their authority, but B, still be on the pulse of what’s going on because especially in marketing and in product, I, of course, don’t want to lose touch with what’s happening and want to make sure that results are still being achieved? Would love your insights and thanks a ton.  Rob Walling:I really like this question because we are often taught how to supervise, how to manage people. I even talk a little bit about it in the SaaS playbook. It’s not focused on that, but talking about how to manage managers is a whole other experience, and there’s a couple things that I have kept in mind during my career as I have done this because I did it both at full-time jobs and of course, I do it today where with MicroConf and TinySeed, I manage people who manage other people. And the couple things that I like to keep in mind are number one, try to find a couple good go-to resources, even simple things like what are the top two or three books you know about management and leadership? And if you have to ask on X/Twitter or if you know what you read coming up that really set you straight and provided a lot of value and education for you, have those as easy references, A, when you hire someone or B, if you promote someone to start managing people, so that you can give them those resources and you may need to consume them again and talk them through the thought process. So that’s number one. Number two is I try to model how I manage and communicate that to my managers. We tend to hire nice people who get along with others. I tell them the hardest part you’re going to experience as a manager is you really have to give negative feedback at a certain point or constructive feedback, however we want to talk about it, and now is the hardest thing for a lot of folks that I know. It’s easy to tell everyone they’re doing a good job. It’s easy to post the confetti emoji in Slack and thank everybody for their hard work. It’s hard to give someone pointed constructive feedback and not feel bad about it. Some people do this really well, some people are jerks and do it all the time, and those are the folks you probably tend to not hire, right? They take it too far. They “tell it like it is,” which usually means they’re an asshole, but folks who are nice and get along and view harmony as a positive thing and they want to get it done and they love working with their teammates, can often find it hard to give negative feedback. So that is one thing that I try to really address early on about you are going to want to get into the habit of giving constructive feedback because if you don’t, it’ll come as this huge surprise six months down the line. If you have five direct reports and you just never do it and then all of a sudden you do, it’s a big deal, but look at it as something that your team members, your direct reports really want. You’re actually helping them improve. That’s the thing that I started learning about myself was that that’s how I learned to couch it in my own head of I’m helping someone improve by telling them, “Hey, I think you could do better on this,” or “Hey, I think we messed up on this. How can we do better next time?” Usually, the best people, already know they messed up on things and you barely need to tell them, but that’s the second thing that I think about. The third thing that I think about is I do implement some light key performance indicators, KPIs. I hate the acronym stuff and the rocks and that I’m just not a big process person, but I do find it helpful to define pretty concretely some numbers that should move in a direction and sometimes this is as lame as NPS. Other times, you can just make up your own satisfaction score. How satisfied are X users? Oftentimes, it’s if they’re in charge of marketing, how many leads are coming through, how fast is growth. If they’re in charge of sales, how many deals are closing, their, customer success, how low is churn? There’s some other things you can add in there, customer support, how fast are we responding and what are the ratings, do we have high ratings of our responses. So getting something in place that’s pretty concrete so that your managers know what they’re managing too can be helpful and it doesn’t have to be super complicated. You can have one, two, three numbers that you agree with, that you collaborate with to decide which are the priorities for the business, and having that means you can talk about those week to week, month to month, and you may need to change them. What you may do is set two or three key performance indicators that you want to go up into [inaudible 00:08:38] and realize, “You know what, these aren’t quite right and we need to adjust them.” But the last thing that I’ll touch on is I do what’s called skip level meetings, and this is where you do maybe a quarterly meeting with the folks who report to your managers to have a conversation, ask them how it’s going, try to suss out, “Hey, is everything good? How are you feeling about things? How is it working with so-and-so?” You may not be able to ask them directly, but you’re just trying to get a sense of how things are going. And I often will ask about what do you want to do next? Where are you headed in terms of self-improvement, professional development? What things excite you about this job? What things do you like the least? What do you want to get better at? What do you want to do next year that you aren’t doing now? What will make you better? And I will ask them, “Have you talked to your manager about this?” I won’t say your manager. I’ll name him by name, but obviously, I would say, “Have you talked to Tracy about this at TinySeed?” And if they haven’t, then I will make it a point. I’ll either say, “Well, do you feel comfortable talking to her about it,” or “I will have a conversation with Tracy and let’s make sure we get you what you need. So it’s obviously more to be said on this topic, but that hopefully gives you a few recommendations for how I would approach it. My next question comes from Sean about attending conferences without overselling.  Sean Matthews:Hey, Sean Matthews from Left Hook here. We currently work as a services company trying to bootstrap our way into a software product. We also have built a open source framework to help develop and deliver user-facing B2B software integrations, so that would be anything you find inside your integrations page. We’ve built a framework that helps build those quickly and has all the infrastructure in place, so leverages a lot of the best of breeded or new packages and concepts architecturally out there. Long story short, our target market, our ideal customer profile are typically partner leaders, product people, sometimes the developers that are being asked to go build those things, CEOs, C-suite, oftentimes startup, but sometimes all the way up to enterprise SaaS. We find ourselves often going to events and thinking about attending events where we, as our own aspiring B2B SaaS founders, attend and actually be part of the conference because we have questions about how do you set up your marketing and what’s the right pricing strategy, et cetera. At the same time, we are around a target rich environment. Everyone is potential customer for us. Aside from, and we’ve done this before is sponsoring, so we’ve sponsored some conferences and that kind of fits fairly nicely, but when we’re not sponsoring, if we go to MicroConf, how do we approach people and just show up while actually being able to sell to them and not feel like we’re selling? And that’s maybe a question of just be yourself, but figured I would ask that because you probably get people that lurk around conferences that really they’re just there to sell as opposed to be a part of the conference. So just curious as your thoughts on that.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Sean. I appreciate it. Yeah, so with MicroConf, some folks attend MicroConf where their audience or their customer, their ICP, ideal customer profile, are the attendees, and usually, it’s pretty obvious the ones that are selling and overselling and they’re annoying. People don’t like them, people avoid them, they pretty quickly find themselves not in the good graces of most of the people there. I think that if you are mindful of this, it’s easy not to oversell. Does that make sense? It’s easy to just be cool, just be cool. Like Samuel Jackson said in Pulp Fiction, “Just hang out.” Wow, quite the reference there, but the idea is people are going to ask you what you do, what company you’re with. You’re going to say, “Oh, I’m with Left Hook and we build software that helps B2B software integrations,” and see if they ask more. They might say, “I don’t have any interest,” and they change the subject or they might say, “Oh, so are you like Zapier?” And you’re like, “Well no, we allow you,” da-da-da-da. It’s a question and you play the conversation, but you don’t go around pitching. You don’t hand people business cards for crying out loud, not at a MicroConf especially, unless I ask for it, right? But the idea is you’re just having a conversation with another founder and you’re a founder and that’s it, and at a certain point, if they show enough interest, you might ask, “Hey, do you want something,” whatever it is. Do you want to try out the software? You have interest in it. You can ask them, but don’t make it high pressure, because it’s not a sales demo that they opted into. The other thing to think about, obviously sponsoring is a great one because if you’re sponsoring, you have a little sponsor tag on your badge, then of course, people are coming up to you because they know what you do and they want to hear that. So it’s kind of an open door for you to communicate that and for you to talk about what you’re doing. The other thing to think about is to apply for attendee talks or lightning talks. A lot of conferences have the opportunity that if you’re already an attendee with a ticket, you can name a topic that you want to talk about that gets you up on stage like at a MicroConf, say it’s 10 or 12 minutes and you don’t want to sell your product, but you might say things we’ve learned integrating with 100 different APIs. And then you say, “I’m the founder of this and this is what we’ve learned and [inaudible 00:14:02] if you’re interested in what we’re doing, it’s very light on sales and very heavy on actionable tactical advice. If you do come to MicroConf for another conference and you are not a sponsor and you start selling pretty heavily, it will get back to the organizers and they will remember your name because we have had folks do that. So I think you’re asking yourself the right question here, how do I do this well. The other thing is to gauge. If you go to SaaStr, everyone’s there to sell their stuff to everyone else. It just is. Everyone’s trying to put deals together, everyone’s trying to put meetings together. That is kind of the point of SaaStr. A lot of people ignore the content because trying to sell. If you go to MicroConf, it’s not like that. And so, you also want to know the audience and know the type of event that it is, and if you don’t know, ask a prior attendee and ask them what the vibe is or you can frankly ask on X/Twitter, I’m really going to struggle to call it X because when I say X, I know that you kind of know what I mean, but it’s tough. So thanks for that question, Sean. Hope it was helpful. My next question comes from the post I made on X and Bankster Life asks, “There are a lot of SaaS companies stuck in the 20 to 30 KMRR range. How do you break out or is it not possible due to market size?” So here’s the thing, I don’t necessarily disagree with there are a lot of SaaS companies stuck in the 20 to 30K market size. I know. I don’t disagree with that, but it’s not as if that’s some magical place where a bunch of SaaS plateaus. If you look at the State of Independent SaaS report, which stateofindiesaas.com, you can download the 2024 report. It just came out a couple of weeks ago. You’ll see we asked what’s your MRR? We surveyed almost 700 B2B SaaS companies. And you’ll see, if you imagine on the left-hand side, it’s like one KMRR and on the right-hand side, it’s, I don’t know, more than 5 million or more than 10 million or whatever, and the left-hand side is the tallest and it’s almost, it’s just a curve down and to the right. It’s just the way these funnels work. It’s the 80/20 rule. It’s like a sales funnel. If you think about, well, 100 people come to my website and 80 people stay longer than five seconds and 50 people click this button and get to the pricing page, it just decreases and decrease. It’s the same thing with MRR. The fact that a bunch of people churn at 20 to 30K is like, “Yeah, but a bunch of people churn at 1K as well and 5K and 10K, and it’s just fewer and fewer make it further and further.” So I want to kind of dispel the notion that there’s some magical 20 to 30K plateau point that is any more magical than any of the other revenue markers, but what I will say is I was going to write a talk about plateaus and it turns out, it just wasn’t going to be a very good talk, but I have this, it’s not even an outline, it’s just a list. I’ve tried to think of every possible reason that a SaaS company would plateau and I came up with 10 of them, okay? So there’s three that are weak product market fit. I don’t like to say pre-product market fit, that implies you suddenly cross this finish line and you have product market fit, but let’s say early or weak product market fit and there’s three of them. Cause number one is churn is too high because you haven’t built something people want. Cause number two is churn is decent so far, but you’re not driving enough traffic. Cause number three is you’ve built a one-time use product rather than building something people want to subscribe to, which is not a recurring product. And then, there are seven when you have stronger product market fit later plateaus. So there are reasons like number one, top of funnel is too small. Cause number two, subpar funnel conversion rates. Cause number three, your churn is too high. Cause number four, a competitor starts eating your lunch, whether on the product or on the marketing front. Cause number five, you’ve tapped out the market, et cetera, et cetera. So you get the idea that you can’t just ask, how do I break through a plateau if you don’t know why you’re in that plateau and someday, obviously, I’m going to put these in something, I don’t know if I’ll do a podcast episode about all of them and talk them through or if I’ll put them in a talk or what have you, but that’s not really the point of this. The idea is, like Bankster Life said in the tweet, how do you work out or is it not possible due to market size? Well, it just depends on your market. If you built an ESP and the market is tens of billions of dollars for sure, it might be larger than that, then no, it’s not due to market size, but if you have targeted an incredibly small niche, then yeah, that’s the reason. And then, you have to decide, do I expand into other verticals? Do I build a second product? That’s the thing, the thinking. This is why general advice when you ask on Twitter, someone will say, “I plateaued and people are telling me that you need to do this or that.” It’s like, well, if they don’t understand or you don’t understand why you’ve plateaued, then how are you going to fix it? And this is my biggest issue, I think, with the whole launch one thing a month and see what sticks because you are not going to know why you’re growing. And so, when you plateau, you’re not going to know why you plateaued because you kind of got lucky because you threw 10, six-sided dice against a wall, one landed as a six, you picked that one up and said, “Well, this is my thing,” and you don’t know why it worked, and that is the biggest issue is if you don’t gain the experience and the skill to actually build the business and grind through the hard parts to get to the good parts, then you don’t necessarily have that knowledge on how to fix the things that break. So thanks for that question, Bankster. I hope my answer was helpful. I know it wasn’t a direct, I mean, it wasn’t a direct answer. The answer is it depends, but hopefully, I’ve given you the full framework of what it depends on or at least a taste of the full list, which again, at some point, I will publish in some form or fashion. It’s just not there yet. It’s not publication ready. Trust me. I know someone’s going to email me and ask me for it, and it’s just a bunch of bullets and then it’s like how to fix it and it’s things like the causes, you don’t have enough top of funnel traffic and it says how to fix, drive more traffic. It’s not. It’s not a tactic of how to do it, it’s just the obvious answer to these things. So I’m just not sure how helpful it actually is in the form that it currently is. My next question is from Adam Denver Co is the username, but it’s Adam Wright on X, “What happens when you’re building a SaaS machine, which is what you want, but it becomes an agency or a more hands-on business?” And so, I responded to Adam and said, “Is your question exactly as you’ve asked it or is it more of a question of how do you not let it become that?” And he responded, “It’s more of a whoops, this happened. What now? I started a job board, jschimp.com, but it’s turning into a hands-on recruiting agency for immediate money. How do I balance the lucrative agency work with my original self-serve vision?” I think for me the answer is if you really don’t want to do the consulting, just don’t do it in the first place or if you’re doing it now and you don’t want to do it, just stop. The downside of that is, oh no, I have this very lucrative agency work that is actually funding the self-serve vision. Then, you need to balance the two, and this is the classic agency trying to turn into a SaaS conundrum and frankly, most agencies don’t make that pivot, because they are so addicted to the amazing money to the 150, $250 an hour that they can bill versus how do I justify building this thing that’s doing a few hundred dollars a month and may never make more than a few hundred dollars a month? It’s risk versus reward, right? You have to think about it as asymmetric upside. If JS Chimp actually succeeds wildly, what is the upside of that versus continuing to do the agency work? I think funding your SaaS, or in this case, it’s a job board, with agency work or freelance work is a great way to do it. I mean, I did that. I did it on the side where Craig Hewitt had a productized service. We have seen some folks do it, but the adjustment to productizing or to getting the product built, can be a difficult one. The way I think about it is either do the lucrative agency work 40 hours a week and then focus on the job board nights and weekends, a self-serve aspect, or set aside one day a week where you do not, or two days or three days, whatever makes sense, set aside a certain amount of time where you absolutely do not let agency work interfere. Maybe that’s two hours a day, maybe it’s one day a week, but be super disciplined about it. The other thing you can do is depending on what has to happen to push JS Chimp forward, can you hire that out to someone who is less expensive than you with the money you get from the lucrative agency work? I used to do this where I was billing 100 to $150 an hour as a software engineer. I was a freelancer contractor and I was billing 40 to 50 hours a week doing that, so I was banking the extra money that I could because we didn’t need all that to live on, and then, I would hire folks at the time, it was in the Philippines, sometimes in India, but these days, depending on your time zone, you can, I don’t necessarily want to recommend those countries at this point, but the idea is that you can hire someone, whether it’s a developer, whether it’s a marketer, whether it’s a whatever needs to get done and do this geo arbitrage, you’ve been hearing about this for years, so then you’re kind of managing one or two individuals to get stuff done and push it forward while you do the more lucrative work. It’s a hard road and most aren’t able to make the shift, and I do think, I mean, I hate to say it’s a lack of discipline, but I kind of think that’s what it is. It’s that you have this thing that is just so much a bird in the hand and it’s hard. It takes real fortitude to not just do more and more and more of that and look, maybe you should just do more and more and more of that. It’s really making you a ton of money and maybe the long-term, self-serve vision isn’t worth it if you can make boatloads of money and hire a team and build a small agency to do the recruiting. We’ve seen remote first recruiting do an amazing job and build incredible seven-figure business on that, and they still have the job board, but I don’t think they regret building the agency around that job board. So I appreciate this question, Adam. I hope my thoughts were helpful. My last question for today is from podcast guest and longtime listener and MicroConf speaker Christopher Gimmer. He’s @cgimmer on Twitter. Give him a follow, “While you are running Drip, I’m curious as to how you structured team meetings and whether you followed any sort of management framework like Traction or EOS,” and he doesn’t say it here, but there’s scaling up, which I think is for later stage folks, “Specifically, I’d love to hear what things looked like when it was just you, Derrick, and a handful of employees versus how you ran things at the point Drip was acquired?” This is a good question and what I will say is I lead and manage a certain way and other folks have different opinions. If you go back and listen to old episodes of Craig Hewitt and Andy Baldacci’s podcast called Seeking Scale, you’ll hear a lot of talk about frameworks and management, and that’s probably if you want to go down that road, I would start there. Craig is very knowledgeable about this stuff. I am not. I know a bit about it. I know the basics, the rocks and the KPIs and this and that, and that’s about all I use. I’m a pretty light framework or light process person in general, and that includes, that extends to when I’m managing people and managing a team. So I did not use any sort of management framework and really have never done that aside from having numbers that we’re shooting for these. Again, I’ll say KPIs, because everyone knows what that means. It just kind of pains me, but it’s just goals for certain things. It’s like I want MRR to go up by this. We need this many leads to do it. This many, we should have a sales conversion rate to demo to close of X, Y, Z percent or above. And so, team meetings were a lot of me leading them and saying, “This is where we’re going. How does everyone feel about it? What are the status updates? What’s working and what’s not? Here are the new things we’re going to try. Here’s a new person we’re going to hire and what’s breaking where so we can figure out how to not let it break?” After we got acquired, we expanded pretty significantly. So the Drip team itself, by the time I left, was 125 people. I was no longer CEO though. I wasn’t running all of that. I was running maybe it was about 20 people between engineering and product that were under me and it was two teams plus products. It was kind of like three different teams. We had two different engineering teams for infrastructure and more like app features and stuff, and then, product folks. I still ran those without rigorous frameworks, although product meetings, once I hired a product manager, he used some, I don’t know, it wasn’t Traction or EOS because it wasn’t about rocks, but there were definitely prioritization frameworks that he brought into it as a more academic and experienced product person, but for better or worse, I do tend to go about this stuff pretty intuitively. I have found that some folks who lean so far into the frameworks do so to their detriment, that the frameworks are a bit like having exact detailed instructions on how to cook a hamburger or a steak that don’t always take into account all the details or all the nuances of cooking a hamburger or a steak, and I feel like if you have some natural inclination of how to borrow just some really minor pieces of Traction, EOS, Scaling Up whatever you want to borrow, but that it fits with your personality to manage in a more intuitive way, I guess what I’ll say is it works for me. It worked at Drip, it was 10. It worked once I was managing 20 and it works at TinySeed MicroConf today. No one could argue that I don’t manage a huge org. I wasn’t running or I don’t run an org that’s say 125 people where I have managers who manage managers, who manage individual contributors. And so, maybe at that point I would need more of a framework. I do know that the CEO who took over, so Clay Collins was CEO when they bought us, and then, another CEO who’s very much more kind of an MBA spreadsheet thinker, and I don’t mean that in a detrimental way. He’s a great operator. He had frameworks, but they were not Traction or EOS. It was kind of his stuff. He learned it in business school and he had seen it in other SaaS companies he’d been involved in and the venture capitalist kind of lean on stuff. So he had his own just self homebrew framework that I think works well for him. It’s a certain style of pushing things forward. It’s a very operational focused versus I tend to be more creative and product focus, so less operational, but all that said, I think there’s a lot of different approaches that can work, and I think as long as you’re not strapped to the dogma, and you don’t get hung up too much on the details of a framework, and be really careful about taking one of these frameworks and just implementing it too early. I like to have the absolute minimum amount of process as long as possible until we need more process, and then I don’t go from 1 to 10, I go from 1 to 2, add a little bit more just sprinkle a little bit on, and then you sprinkle a little bit on as things start to break or as you’re like, “Yeah, we do need more process.” Things are getting complicated, communications, breaking down and we’re not getting stuff done. People don’t know what they should be doing. Then, I’m ratcheted up from two to two and a half, two to three. You get the idea? That is my personality, that’s how I work, and it works for me, and I think the idea is it’s best for you to know yourself and develop your skills that lean into your personal giftings. And so, if frameworks, and I’ll say just more left brain thinking about it works for you, then think about how can I adapt this framework to the size of my team because again, I don’t think EOS is great at five people. I think there’s too much process and I don’t know exactly the number where it’s a perfect fit, but I personally would be concerned. I would really strip it down and I guess these days, I kind of do run an extremely stripped down version of one of these. It’s basically just, “Here are the goals. Let’s go. Let’s update and work great as a team.” And there’s a bit more to it than that, but you get the idea. I feel like I’ve covered this point. I really do appreciate your question on this, Christopher. I hope that was helpful. If you have a question for this show, I’m going to be moving even text questions as you heard in this episode, that are a bit more advanced, intermediate to advanced. Later stage text questions are going to go to the top of the stack along with audio and video questions. I hope you enjoy this focus of thinking more about what do folks who are already managing managers think about and other topics that’ll be more applicable to that stage. Thanks for joining me this week and every week.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and this week I speak with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Charles Duhigg. Charles writes for the New York Times and New Yorker magazine and has written three books including The Power of Habit, Smarter Faster Better, and most recently, Super Communicators. I wanted to have Charles on the show not to cover material from the book per se, but to figure out how to translate that into why being a better communicator should matter to you as a bootstrapper. Whether you’re having conversations at your day job, while you’re doing your side hustle, whether you’re doing sales demos, whether you are talking to folks that you have hired, contractors or full-time employees, or even communicating with your spouse or significant other as you try to navigate the frothy waters of building your company. Charles is extremely well-spoken and has a deep, deep understanding of this topic, so it was a pleasure to have him on the show. Let’s dive into our conversation. Charles Duhigg, thanks for joining me on the show.  Charles Duhigg:Thanks for having me on.  Rob Walling:It’s great to find to meet you. We were talking offline and I realized I’ve read at least two, maybe three of your books, but I hadn’t put together … Sometimes you just don’t put together that the author has written all these books. So Power of Habit, a lot of folks have probably heard of, as well as Smarter Faster Better, and most recently Super Communicators, and that’s what we’re here to talk about today. How to unlock the secret language of connection. And I know there’s a lot of listeners probably listening to this thinking, “You know what? I’m a software developer. I’m going to go indie hack my way and build a solo empire.” But you always need to know how to communicate with people, and that’s why I wanted to have you on the show today.  Charles Duhigg:Yes. Even if you are building a solo empire, you probably have a spouse or a significant other at home, and if you’re not communicating well with them, it does not matter how big your solo empire becomes. Communication is at the heart of what humans do, and it’s critical.  Rob Walling:Yep. And I used to be a not great communicator, and I’ve had to develop that over the past 10 or 15 years. I grew up left brain, introvert, developer, and so I would almost gravitate towards roles where it’s like, well, I just don’t need to communicate with people. Again, I’m going to be that solo person just doing my thing. And I’ve learned that the better I’ve got at communication … Partially through doing this podcast, to be honest. You talk for 720 episodes, you get a little better at it. But also dealing with the hard things of life, starting companies. As you said, working with my spouse on those. I think to get us started, there are super communicators, which the book is about, which are folks that are much, much better at communicating than what normies, we might call Muggles, as they call them in Harry Potter. But just define the term for us to set the stage.  Charles Duhigg:Sure. Absolutely. And it’s worth noting that all of us are super communicators at one time or another. So here’s a great way of demonstrating it. If you were having a bad day and you came home after this long day and you’re feeling lousy and you’re like, “You know what, I’m going to call someone I know calling this person will make me feel better.” Do you know who you would call? Does that person pop into your mind?  Rob Walling:Yep.  Charles Duhigg:Who is that?  Rob Walling:It’s a friend of mine named Brendan.  Charles Duhigg:Okay, Brendan. So for you, Brendan is a super communicator and you’re probably a super communicator back to him. And I’m guessing … And tell me if I’m getting this wrong, I’m guessing that one of the reasons why you love talking to Brendan is he knows what questions to ask you, and he proves to you that he’s listening and he shares things about himself. He doesn’t try and steal the spotlight, but he’ll share things about himself. And so it just feels really good to talk to him. So there are some people who can do this with anyone. There are some people who can be consistent super communicators. And the reason why is because they’ve recognized the skills that Brendan brings to his conversation with you and the skills that you almost unconsciously use in talking to Brendan, those are fungible skills. Those are skills that you can use with anyone once you recognize it’s a skill. It’s just like learning how to read. If you learn to read on nonfiction, that doesn’t mean you can’t read fiction or you can’t read a cookbook. It’s a completely fungible skill. Communication we’ve discovered is exactly the same, and so anyone can become a super communicator. It’s just a matter of understanding that there’s this handful of skills that you need to recognize the skills, and once you do, you can practice them until they become habits and use them with anyone.  Rob Walling:Got it. Well, let’s dive right in then. What are the skills? If someone’s thinking to themselves, I want to be able to communicate better, have hard conversations. And maybe it’s having hard conversations about firing someone. Maybe it’s having hard conversations about saying, “Hey, you’re not cutting it. I want to try to train you up, but I have to give you hard feedback.” Right?  Charles Duhigg:Totally.  Rob Walling:You can be an employee and have these conversations. You can be in your own company and have employees, but how do you get better at being a communicator?  Charles Duhigg:Yeah. There’s a handful of them. The first one is to understand what kind of conversation you’re having. This book really started when I fell into this bad pattern with my wife, which literally anyone in a relationship will recognize, which is I would come home from work after a long day, I’d start complaining about my day, and my wife very reasonably would suggest some practical solutions. She’d be like, “Oh, you should just take your boss out to lunch and you guys will get to know each other a little bit better.” And instead of being able to hear what she was saying, I would get even more upset. And I’d be like, “Why aren’t you supporting me? You’re supposed to be on my side. You’re supposed to be outraged on my behalf.” She would get upset because I was attacking her for giving me good advice. And so I went to these researchers and I was like, “What’s going on here? I’m a professional communicator. Why do I, and everyone I know fall into this pattern?” And they were like, “Well, actually, we’re living through a golden age of understanding communication because of advances in neuroimaging and data collection. We really know what’s happening inside people’s brains for the first time.” And they said, “One of the things that we’ve learned is that when you have a discussion, you assume that discussion is about one thing. You’re talking about your day or you’re talking about your kid’s grades, or where to go on vacation. But actually every discussion is made up of different kinds of conversations.” And in general, these conversations, they tend to fall into one of three buckets. There’s practical conversations where we’re solving problems together or we’re making plans, but then there’s also emotional conversations where I might tell you what I’m feeling and I don’t want you to solve my feelings, I want you to empathize. And then there’s social conversations, which is about how we relate to each other and to society. And they said, “What we’ve learned is if you’re having different kinds of conversations at the same moment, it’s really hard to hear each other. It’s really hard to connect.” Which is of course what was happening with me. I was coming home and having an emotional conversation. My wife was responding with a practical conversation, and as a result, we really couldn’t hear each other. And so the first thing that super communicators do really well is they just take a step back and they just asked themselves what kind of conversation does it seem like we’re having right now? Are we having an emotional conversation, a practical conversation, a social conversation? And there’s ways to flush that out and help you figure out what kind of conversation you’re having. But once they know, then they lean into it. They try and match the other person or invite them to match themselves. And within psychology, that’s known as the matching principle, that successful communication requires having the same kind of conversation at the same moment.  Rob Walling:As you’re saying this, I know a super communicator. It’s my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling. Folks who listens to the podcast will know. A, she’s a psychologist, so she’s trained, but B, she has empathy, and also she’s now a professional. She’s a CEO and founder coach. She’s an entrepreneur herself and just deals with a lot of entrepreneurs. Anyone who’s talked to her, who’s listening to this knows that she picks up on where you are and then goes with it. So that’s fascinating. I think that’s helpful for listeners who are listening right now, think of the person … There’s got to be someone in your life who is just amazing at this. And what is it? Is it that they pick up on the speaker, the other person where they are and meets them there? Do they also sometimes transition? You said there are three types but-  Charles Duhigg:Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. It’s both of it. So let’s talk about how we figure out what kind of conversation we’re having. One thing we know about consistent super communicators is that they ask more questions than the average person. They ask 10 to 20 times as many questions as the average person. And some of those questions are very special questions that are known as deep questions. And a deep question is something that asks me about my values or my beliefs or my experiences. And that can sound intimidating. It sounds like that’s a big question, but it’s actually as simple as if you meet someone and you’re like, “What do you do for a living?”, and they say, “I’m a doctor.”, it’s natural to say like, “Oh, where do you practice medicine?” But a better question, a deep question is to say like, “Oh, what made you decide to go to medical school?” Because when I’m asking that question, what I’m really asking you is tell me about who you are. Tell me about your experiences, your values, the things that shaped you. And it’s an invitation. It’s not a mandate, it’s an invitation. But what tends to happen is that when you ask a deep question, when you ask someone how they feel about their life, instead of the facts of their life, they tend to tell you what kind of mindset they’re in. So the same person, that doctor, depending on the situation, depending on how they’re feeling that day, they may answer that question one of two ways. They might say something like, “Oh, I wanted a steady job, and I knew that medicine would always be a steady job.” Okay. They’re in a practical mindset right now. But that same person, if they’re feeling more vulnerable, they might say something like, “When I was a kid, I saw my dad get sick, and I saw the doctors and the nurses help him, and I wanted to be one of those people.” That person’s in a much more emotional mindset. And so once I know what kind of mindset you’re in, then I can match you. And I can say, “Oh, it’s so interesting you mentioned that. I’m a lawyer and I became a lawyer because I saw my uncle get arrested when I was a kid.” And I can also invite you to match me. For instance, when I come home and I’m talking to my wife and she listens to me complain and she emotes with me, at some point she can say, “I understand how you’re feeling. Do you want to talk about solutions? Because I think that there’s a way to solve this problem.” So what super communicators do is they ask deep questions to try and figure out what kind of conversation is happening, and then they match the other person and invite them to match themselves. And that can sound hard, but it’s actually very, very easy and very natural and graceful because our brain makes asking deep questions and matching into a habit very quickly.  Rob Walling:You’re so on point, and it reminds me of … I don’t know if you’ve seen it on Instagram, but there’s a text where a guy’s girlfriend texts him and says, “I just bought an ice cream cone, and the scoop fell off onto the sidewalk.” And he says, “Are we in a feeling and empathy mode, or would you like to hear solutions?” Total tone-deaf, but it totally links into what you’re saying, right?  Charles Duhigg:And yet what’s interesting is from the outside that seems totally tone-deaf, but when I come home and I’m having a bad day and my wife says to me, “Okay. Do you want to talk about solutions or do you just need to complain and get this off your chest?”, I actually really appreciate it. Because I’m like, “No, no, no. This isn’t a big deal. I just want to vent for a couple of minutes.” So asking maybe over a text is not the best way of doing it. There might be a little slightly more graceful way. But when you’re in that conversation, it actually feels good to have someone ask you, “What can I do to help you? What are you looking for in this conversation?” That’s not something that feels ungraceful, that feels actually very welcoming.  Rob Walling:Do you have any advice on how to transition from one type of conversation to another? And I want to give you a specific examples, so let’s say that I’m in a weekly or monthly one-on-one with someone who reports to me. And there’s often … Well, early, there’s chitchat, and then we get in like, “How are you doing?” There’s the emotional like, “How are things going over the past month? Is there anything we need to address in terms of your happiness here at the company?” And at a certain point, maybe you do need to transition that to being more practical, maybe giving feedback or whatever. But how does one do that elegantly?  Charles Duhigg:Honestly, the best way to do it … And there’s two things to do here. Let’s talk about a conflict situation and a non-conflict situation. In a non-conflict situation, if you’re like, “How are you doing here?”, and they’re saying, “Oh, I’m frustrated with this one thing, and my wife thinks I’m not home enough.” Listen. Say, “I’ve had that similar experience myself.” And at some point you can literally just say, “Look, we’ve been talking about how we feel. Is it okay if I propose a solution to you, if I make a suggestion?” What you’re really saying is, can I move this conversation from an emotional conversation to a practical conversation? Now, the fact that you’re asking permission to do it, almost inevitably the other person says yes, but it also feels like instead of you mandating that they have to have a different kind of conversation, you’re inviting them to match you in return. So that’s very elegant, it’s very graceful. It doesn’t feel weird. But let’s talk about a conflict situation where it’s hard to do that. So in a conflict situation, what’s really important is that we prove that we’re listening to the other person. And by conflict situation, I mean even if we just disagree about something. We’re talking about something where we just see things a little bit differently. So maybe it’s not a fight, maybe it’s not that hard a conversation, but it’s something where there’s a little bit of a difference. It’s really important to prove that we’re listening. And there’s actually a technique for doing this that they teach at Harvard and Stanford and all these other fancy schools that’s known as looping for understanding. And the reason it’s important to prove that we’re listening is because in many conversations in the back of our mind, we suspect that the other person is not listening, they’re just waiting their turn to speak. So that situation you described before where they’re complaining and you want to get a practical, if you just jump in with a practical, it seems to the other person, they’re like, “Oh, he basically sat there while I complained but now we’re talking about the thing he wants to talk about.” But if we prove that we’re listening, we overcome that suspicion that the other person’s just waiting their turn to speak. And what looping for understanding does is it has these three steps. Step one is ask a question, preferably a deep question. Step two is after the person has answered the question, repeat back what they said to you in your own words. And the key here is not mimicry. It’s to prove to them you’re paying attention. And more importantly, to prove to them that you’re processing what they’re saying. And then step three, and this is the one we usually forget, ask if you got it right. Because one of two things will happen. The first thing is they’ll say like, “No, I don’t think you understood what I was saying.” Which is really useful to know. The second thing is that they’ll say, “Yeah, I think you understood what I was saying.” And what we actually did in that moment is we asked them for permission to acknowledge that we were listening. And when they acknowledge that we were listening, they become more likely to listen to us in return. So when you’re in that conversation and you’re trying to transition to something, or when you’re in a tough conversation and you’re trying to move it from criticism to solution finding, if you prove to the other person that you’re listening to them, they become much, much more willing to match you, to join you in having a more productive conversation.  Rob Walling:Got it. You were saying that was more of a conflict approach, so that could be applied with a spouse, significant other, that could be applied at work. Yeah.  Charles Duhigg:Yeah. When we go in and we give someone some performance feedback that’s not overwhelmingly positive, when we have a partner and we disagree about how to move forward and we have to come to a consensus, if we prove to each other that we’re listening as our first and primary goal, that conversation is going to go much, much better.  Rob Walling:Hiring senior developers can really move the needle in your business, but if you bring on the wrong person, you can quickly burn through your runway. If you need help finding a vetted, senior, results oriented developer, you should reach out to today’s sponsor, Lemon.io. For years, they’ve been helping our audience find high quality global talent at competitive rates. And they can help you too. Don’t just take my word for it. Listener Dylan Pierce had this to say about working with Lemon.io. “The machine learning engineer they helped me hire was very professional and even learned a new tech stack to set up an environment to train and deploy machine learning models. He documented his work clearly so I could train it in the future with additional data. I’m super happy with the results.” And longtime listener, Chas Youn, hired a senior developer from Lemon.io and said his hire, “Definitely knew his stuff. Provided appropriate feedback and pushback, and had great communication, including very fluent English. He really exceeded my expectations.” Chas said he’d definitely use Lemon.io again when he’s looking for a senior level engineer. To learn more and get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer, head to lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. I want to switch it up a little bit because we’ve been talking about close relationships, people you work with, significant others, life partners and such. There’s another element to communication, and I want to give you another scenario. So we host an event called MicroConf. We host it twice a year where a bunch of entrepreneurs, a couple of hundred entrepreneurs get together. And one of the most valuable parts of the event is what we call the hallway track, which is not the main track, it’s where you go out in the hallway and you’re talking to other entrepreneurs. So there’s a lot of introverted folks who want to connect with other founders, and they maybe are not sure, how do I do this well? How do I not ask the same three questions? How do I not stay on the surface? How do I make connections with those who I want to connect with? Do you have any advice for those folks?  Charles Duhigg:Yeah. Absolutely. There’s been a lot of experiments on this. And it’s interesting because I think the people who are introverts, they think that they’re at a disadvantage to being a super communicator, and it’s actually not true at all. In fact, one of the things that we know is it doesn’t matter if you’re an introvert or extrovert. Because these are skills, really, they’re skills that can be learned by anyone. Moreover, what we know is that people who are real super communicators consistently, if you ask them, were you always good at communication, they often say no. They say things like, “I had trouble making friends in high school, and so I really had to study how kids talk to each other.” Or, “My parents got divorced and I had to be the peacemaker between them.” And it’s the act of thinking about communication that makes someone a super communicator. This is what super communicators do, is they think a little bit more about just what’s going on here. So here’s the thing that I would say. There was this experiment that was done at Harvard Business School where they brought a bunch of students into a room and they said, “Look, you’re about to have a conversation with a stranger.” Telling someone you have to have a conversation with a stranger is one of the most anxiety producing things you can do for anyone. And they said, “But before you have this conversation, here’s what we want you to do. Take out a piece of paper. Just write down three topics or questions you might want to talk about. Stupid stuff like are you going to the party this weekend? I just saw Dune two and I thought it was terrible. What do you think about it? Just write down three things.” And so they did. They stuck them in their pocket, then they went and they had the conversations. And afterwards they asked everyone how’d those conversations go? And the participant said, “Interestingly, the three things I wrote down, they never came up, but I felt so much more confident and calm during that conversation. I felt like I could really focus on the other person so much better because I knew that if there was going to be that awkward silence, I knew what I was going to say. I knew what I had in my back pocket.” And for introverts in particular, but this is true for everyone, the thing that makes conversations hard is not the conversation itself, it’s our anxiety about the conversation. We’re thinking like, “I’m going to go into this hallway. I’m going to have to talk to five people I’ve never talked to before. It’s going to be exhausting. There’s going to be weird, awkward silences.” And so when we can remove that anxiety, it allows us to tap into our natural communication and listening and speaking instincts much more easily. So simply just writing down three things that you might want to talk about, that can change things entirely. And what’s important to realize is that the reason why this is so powerful is because communication is Homo sapiens superpower. It’s the reason our species has been so successful. So as a result, our brains have evolved to be really, really good at communication. Like an introvert’s brain and an extrovert’s brain, and someone who’s somewhere on the spectrum, their brain, all of our brains are really good at communication. And oftentimes what we need to do is we need to allow our brains to do what they’re good at. And when we’re anxious or when we’re uptight, or when we’re like, okay, my goal is I have 30 seconds with this person and I want to impress them how smart I am, that’s when we get in the way of our instincts. But the more we allow ourselves to just do what feels natural, the better those conversations are going to go.  Rob Walling:It reminds me of the first time you give a talk in front of a bunch of people and you know the material pat. You know it forwards and backwards, and then you get up in front and you freeze, and the blood rushes to your head and the hair stands up on the back of your neck, and you become just a … presenter. And you watch it back later and it’s like, ah, it wasn’t as bad as I thought, but it’s the anxiety. It’s not your ability to communicate because when you gave it to yourself in the bathroom mirror with no anxiety, it was a great … presentation. But when you get up in front of people …  Charles Duhigg:And in the 30th time you give that speech when you’re bored by it, so you have zero anxiety because you’re like, I know exactly what I’m doing. When all of a sudden on the stage you start doing these flourishes and these little charismatic things. It’s because you’re not thinking about giving the speech. You’re just giving the speech. And that frees your brain up to let all those instincts come out to be like, oh, here’s a fun joke. It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ll just try this joke out. And that’s why it’s so important that these are skills. Is because our brains are designed that when we identify these skills and we practice them, our brain makes them into habits very, very quickly. And once they’re habits, we don’t have to think about them. We get to just relax and let the habit take over.  Rob Walling:I mentioned to you offline that I listened to your book last week as I was driving around Iceland, and it was super enjoyable to hear about it. One thing that struck me … And I don’t know that you phrased it in this way, but I was thinking, man, I can get really good at unquote small talk based on some things you said in the book, even beyond the example we just used at a conference. But if you’re a salesperson, usually you want to build rapport in the first two to three minutes as you’re doing a sales demo. I interview hundreds of startup founders every year or two to get into the accelerator. There’s just a lot of times when I find a meeting someone new for the first time, I have a 20-minute call, I need to get rapport very quickly. And usually small talk is just garbage. It’s like, “Oh, where are you from? What’s the weather?” This and that. But you had examples of, here’s a question that most people ask, here’s how to ask it in a way that is much more effective. Can you talk us through that?  Charles Duhigg:Absolutely. Absolutely. So in the book, there’s all these stories. There’s the story of a CIA officer who asked to recruit an overseas agent that’s just terrible at it, or the Big Bang Theory. Why the writers of the Big Bang Theory were able to make it work. And at the core of a lot of those is just a reframing of what’s going on in a conversation. So let’s say it’s small talk. Let’s say you meet someone you’re trying … You don’t know anything about them. You’re trying to get to know them. And you say like, “Oh, what part of town do you live in?” And they say, “I live in the Heights.” That’s a dead end. But if your next question is, “Oh man, the Heights, that’s really interesting. What do you like about it up there? Why did you guys decide to move up there?” That’s a deep question. And what that person is going to say is they’re going to say something like, “Oh, my kids’ schools are near there and so we just wanted to be close to it. And there’s also this great community. We used to live in the valley and we didn’t know any of our neighbors, and now we live up in the Heights and we know all of our neighbors.” So at that moment, what you can do is you can reciprocate and you can say … Because what you just told me is you told me you have family, community is important to you. You’ve been in this town for a little while, long enough to at least live in two different places. I’ve learned so much about you just by asking, “What do you like about the Heights?” And at that point, I can reciprocate and I can say, “Oh, it’s so interesting. I have two kids also, and actually, we live over in a different part of town in Midtown. But it’s similarly, the reason I love it is because we just know our neighborhood and it’s such a diverse neighborhood. There’s all these people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s just really interesting.” Now we’re actually communicating with each other. Now we’re actually bonding a little bit. And that doesn’t mean we’re going to be best friends, but it definitely means that we are making a connection. We feel like we know something about each other. And all it took to do that was just to ask you a question about how you feel about something and then to reciprocate what I’m hearing.  Rob Walling:And is that something that you yourself do if you go to a dinner party?  Charles Duhigg:Oh, I do it all the time.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Charles Duhigg:Oh, yeah. Yeah. I do it literally all the time. I mean, there’s this guy named Nick Epley at the University of Chicago. He plays this game where he’ll get on a bus, and his goal within three questions of sitting down next to a stranger is to get them talking about their hopes and dreams. And he says usually it takes two questions because he’ll sit down next to someone and he’ll be like, “Hey, what do you do for a living?” And they’re like, “I’m an accountant.” And he is like, “Oh, did you always want to be an accountant? Was that your dream when you were a kid?” And they’re like, “No, of course not. Who has a dream to be an accountant as a kid? No, I wanted to be an astronaut.” And then they’re off to the races. They’re talking about their dreams when they were young. I do it all the time. Again, once you practice it once or twice, it becomes a habit and it’s so easy. It’s so easy to connect with other people simply by just asking them what seems like a fairly benign question.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And that’s fascinating because it’s, when I first read the summary of Super Communicators before I listened to the book, I thought it was going to be about … I don’t know if you’ve read the book Crucial Conversations.  Charles Duhigg:Yeah.  Rob Walling:It’s about having hard conversations or being able to communicate complex things or whatever. But it really runs the gamut because you and I, just in this 20-minute conversation, have talked about small talk, we’ve talked about dealing with a significant other spouse, a life partner. We’ve talked about dealing with direct reports. We’ve talked about being at a conference, which I guess is small talk, but it’s different. The super communicator moniker that you’re talking about and that you describe in the book really does cover the gamut of person-to-person interactions.  Charles Duhigg:Oh, absolutely. And if you think about it, what do we consistently spend most of our time doing? We all eat once or twice a day or three times a day or more. We all sleep every single night. But if you were to actually log most of the minutes, you spend certainly in the top three, if not, the top one would be communicating with other people. It’s like asking your kids, how are you doing, you’re getting to school today, ordering a coffee, talking to the barista to give her your order, calling the person you’re working on some project with. Communication is at the core of what we do. And so you’re exactly right. Being a super communicator, it’s not about hard conversations, it’s about all conversations.  Rob Walling:And that actually brings me to an interesting question, and you may have addressed this in the book. I definitely was daydreaming a bit, staring at the volcanoes in the mountains as I was driving through Iceland. So something that occurred to me is a lot of my communication is via email and DM and Slack. It’s not verbal. You and I on this, again, in the last 20 minutes, we talked a lot about verbal. Does it change? Is it different when you’re typing?  Charles Duhigg:The same principles apply, but the important thing is to recognize that each form of communication has slightly different rules. So one of my favorite examples of this, just to put it in context, is about a hundred years ago when telephones were first becoming popular, there were all these articles that appeared that said no one will ever have a real conversation over telephone. Because think about it, up to that moment, all conversations that happened basically face-to-face. And they said, “Look, if you can’t see the other person, you’re not going to be able to understand what they’re feeling. You’re going to miss all their facial expressions, their gestures.” What’s interesting is that at the time, they were exactly right. So if you listen to early phone conversations or transcripts of early phone conversations, what you see is that people basically use them as telegrams. They would call up and give someone a grocery list or a stock order, but they didn’t know how to have a back-and-forth. Now, by the time you and I were in middle school, we could talk for seven hours a night on the phone, and they were the most meaningful conversations of our lives, and that’s because we learned the rules for talking on phones. One of the rules … And you still live by it, I live by it. We all do it subconscious without even realizing it. When we’re talking to someone on the phone and we can’t see them, we over enunciate our words by about 15 or 20%. We put about a third more emotion into our voice because we know the other person can’t see our facial expressions. We do that without even thinking about it. Now, the thing is that there are slightly different rules for phone conversations than face-to-face conversations. The same thing is true of DMS and texting and sending a messages with emojis and sending an email versus having a Zoom call. When we get into trouble is when we forget the rules. Or it’s not even like we forget the rules, we just don’t pay attention to them. So I know that if I’m going to send you something hard, if I can do it over voice, that’d be great, and if I can’t, it’s definitely better to do it over email than it is over text. That’s not a huge discovery. But when we’re moving really fast and we’re just thinking about ourselves and we’re just thinking about getting the information across, we forget to remind ourselves what are the rules of texting versus DMs versus something else? That’s when we suddenly send that text that the other person reads, and they get pissed off because they took it out of context. So the only real difference … All the same principles apply, the difference is that there are slightly different rules and slightly different strengths or weaknesses for each channel of communication and we have to remind ourselves of that.  Rob Walling:And if folks want to dig in deeper, they can buy Super Communicators wherever greater books are sold.

Hope you enjoyed this episode. Obviously a little different than some episodes of this podcast, but I like to broaden my own horizons, as you can tell, from … I think I’m at 904 audiobooks in my Audible account, and sometimes I like to share topics that may not be in the direct focused wheelhouse that you might experience week to week on this show. But know that if you come back to this podcast again next week, it will continue to have content, information, insights, and hopefully inspiration to motivate you to continue building your company. My mission is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups, and that’s why I record this podcast each week. That’s why it focuses on building incredible businesses that may not change the world, but they can change your life and the life of those around you. Thanks so much for joining me this week and every week. This is Rob Walling signing off from episode 723.","PublishedAt":"July 23, 2024","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-723-how-to-be-a-supercommunicator-and-why-it-matters-as-a-bootstrapper-with-charles-duhigg"},{"Title":"Episode 722 | Bootstrapping a Vertical SaaS to 7-Figures in 18 Months","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 722 | Bootstrapping a Vertical SaaS to 7-Figures in 18 Months\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t39:04\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 39:04 | Recorded on July 16, 2024\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 722, Rob Walling interviews James Mooring, co-founder of Astalty, a SaaS serving Australia’s NDIS market.

I am your host, Rob Walling, and today I talk with James Mooring, the co-founder of Astalty. James and his co-founder have a pretty incredible story of bootstrapping a vertical SaaS app to seven figures in ARR in 18 months. A lot of things went right for them, but it’s obvious that James and his co-founder are very smart and executed exceptionally well. I know that sometimes it’s helpful to hear founder stories of people failing, making mistakes, picking themselves back up, and sometimes it’s inspiring and you can learn a lot from the tactics, the strategies, and the approaches that someone used to achieve relatively fast success and quick growth. As James and his co-founder have done, they’ve built an enviable business by all measures. One thing I like about this conversation is it’s not just the headline of how they bootstrapped the seven-figure business in 18 months, but James is very thoughtful about how they did it. Sometimes when you talk to folks, they don’t really know how they did it. They lucked into it and they claim it was all word-of-mouth and virality. These things that it’s like, “Well, A, that’s not helpful to me if I want to grow a business and, B, I don’t actually think that’s what happened.” With James, he’s given it a lot of thought. I think directionally, he’s pretty correct with why they were successful, which is even more helpful for you listening to this podcast because, now, you can potentially take some of the learnings from his journey and apply them to yours. With that, let’s dive into my conversation. James, welcome to Startups For the Rest of Us.  James Mooring:Perfect. Good morning. Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:It’s nice to have you on, sir. So your company is Astalty and your H1 is, “Simplify your NDIS business operations. Ready to take your NDIS business to the next level? Try Astalty, the most straightforward NDIS software with the most advanced features.” What is NDIS? I’ve never heard of this. Literally, I had to Google it before this. So if someone does not live in Australia, describe what NDIS is and then what your software does.  James Mooring:I think some people that do live in Australia still probably don’t know. The NDIS is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, so it’s essentially a government-funded scheme that provides funding to people that have a disability to go and access supports from service providers for a range of different things. It could be accessing the community, it could be accommodation, it could be assistance at home with self-care, things like that. Our software provides a platform for businesses that provide those supports to those people with a disability to run their business.  Rob Walling:Got it. Let’s say Gymdesk is a TinySeed company and their software is like the operating system for a gym. Your entire business runs on it, people check in and out with a key fob to get in the thing and it tracks that they’re there and it does invoicing and billing and subscriptions. Just imagine everything that a gym or a [foreign language 00:03:50] or a yoga studio, a fitness studio needs. So it’s kind of the OS, the operating system of that? Jim, is that what Astalty does for these, they’re not affiliates, NDIS providers?  James Mooring:NDIS providers, yeah, NDIS service providers. Yeah. The term CRM is very common here for what we do, but essentially how you’ve described it is exactly what it does. Most businesses will subscribe to Astalty, an accounting software like Xero or similar and then they’ll have their Microsoft or Google to power their email, and ideally that’d be all they need.  Rob Walling:And talk to me about where the business stands today.  James Mooring:So now, we’re a team of five. We’re doing seven-figures ARR and still growing significantly every month, so it’s in a really good spot.  Rob Walling:And this has happened very quickly. It probably doesn’t feel that way. I know your timeline… Timeline always feels really long, but when I actually read through it, because you were very generous to send me the entire timeline which is what we’re going to work off for here, it seems like from actual paid launch until seven-figure ARR was less than two years.  James Mooring:I think, around 18 months, we worked it out to be.  Rob Walling:Unbelievable. That is so fast.  James Mooring:From when we launched our first paid offering to when we hit the seven figures.  Rob Walling:Unbelievable. So one thing before we dive in, because… Here’s what I want to cover for someone listening to this, it’s to figure out how you got here this quickly and then to pull out things that you and your co-founder did really well where you were smart and then potentially where there were things where maybe you got lucky, as you and I saw in Atlanta, because you were at MicroConf Atlanta, which is how we met, where potentially… As Ben Chestnut said, they Forrest Gumped their way in. They kind of stumbled. They got a little lucky, and that’s okay too. It’s not 100% luck. It’s that, along the way, sometimes you do things and they turn out really well. Before we dive into that though, Astalty, you told me, stands for a solution that actually listens to you. Is it a dad joke? It’s like it’s not a good acronym. What’s the deal with it?  James Mooring:I think when we came up with it, we had much, much worse business ideas. And a lot of businesses in the space had care or health or these types of words in their business name, and we didn’t want to be that. The whole premise behind Astalty was that we felt that software was built by people that have no idea about the actual business problems that they were solving. At the time, we thought, “Why not try an acronym?” and this kind of came out and then it stuck. We don’t put that acronym everywhere, but it’s a very sticky business name and people remember it, but it does actually drive a lot of our, I guess, culture around how we invest time with our customers and build features, I suppose.  Rob Walling:And astalty.com.au, if folks want to check out your website. You touched on something right there that I want to dig a little deeper into. You talked about how in… Well, let me just say this. In deep verticals, where there’s a lot of subject matter expertise required to build a good tool, we see one of two mistakes usually. We see a software developer who comes into it and doesn’t actually understand the business problems. So then they build, it can be good software, but it doesn’t do the business any justice. It doesn’t actually solve the problem. Or, vice versa… We see subject matter experts who are like, “I’m in roofing construction and I’m going to hire a developer,” but they’re not a product person. So they have the subject matter expertise of what it should do, but the product sucks. You and your co-founder are a developer and a subject matter expert, and that combination is in the top three co-founder combos that we see, right? I’ve invested 191 to companies and the top three, in no particular order, it’s kind of all tied for one in my head, is a developer plus a marketer or a developer plus a salesperson, depending on if it’s a hired low touch funnel, and developer plus subject matter experts, as long as that subject matter expert is willing to do the sales or the marketing. So you and your co-founder… You’re the developer, right? And your co-founder was in the NDIS system. Does he have a consultancy or a software company in there?  James Mooring:He has an NDIS service provider business. So, he actually is one of… His business uses our software and we’d been talking about the NDIS for early days. My job was to try and decode what he was saying and think, “How can we solve these processes using software?” And I think that kind of unique position is part of the reason why we built such a good product.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that makes sense. In a space like this, you would need… I don’t know that you would need a co-founder. It sure help, but you would really want what we call a patient zero, a customer zero who really is on board with being able to advise you, or you’d need an advisor or an advisory board, two or three people, who all had NDIS. You could have done it different ways, but this to me is one of the ideal ways because then he has so much skin in the game, right?  James Mooring:Yeah.  Rob Walling:And if he was willing to help with sales and marketing as well, something that… If we rolled the calendar back three years to… We’re recording this in June of ’24. We roll back to June of ’21, you talked about development work on Astalty starting slowly and that you were going to try to do everything that a CRM in the space had to do, but then you realized that you would probably do that quite poorly. So, you instead streamlined to just focusing on support coordination. This is, I think, a lesson that a lot of developers screw up is they don’t want to build an MVP with limited functionality or they don’t want to focus the thing down thinking they didn’t solve a big enough problem. So, I guess it sounds like that was the right choice for you. And how did you come to that? How’d you come to that conclusion?  James Mooring:Yeah, absolutely. So I think Jona, my co-founder, when he was explaining everything, I was thinking, “This is fine. We can do this.” And then we started and we’re like, “We need this thing, and that means we need this thing.” And then the waterfall just got so big. And then we wanted to get to market quickly. So what we did is we really said, “Well, where’s the gap?” and we focused on that. And then I’m really glad we did it back then because if we came to that realization 12 months later, it would’ve been an absolute mess. It’s kind of funny because through that process of really focusing on a niche, within a niche, you could say, “We actually built 90% of the functionality that we need to serve the whole NDIS space.” It’s just that there’s one kind of scheduling piece, and that’s what we’re working on building now. So it was just interesting that by niching down, we were still able to build functionality that would help us serve the customers that we wanted to serve initially, if that makes sense.  Rob Walling:It does. It does. So your co-founder, you and he are talking through NDIS and he’s probably saying, “There’s no good software on the market.” He’s saying, “There’s a huge gap.” What was his company using before you built Astalty?  James Mooring:They were using another software that they actually still use because it does the functionality that Astalty doesn’t quite do. So, they use both at the moment. Yeah, there was just no innovation in the space that we felt, so we came out and surprised… You put a really nice easy-to-use interface on something, you speak the language that your customers speak and you make the product easy to use, which sounds so simple, right? But it’s funny how far that could actually go.  Rob Walling:How many NDIS providers are there in Australia?  James Mooring:I think probably a few, a couple hundred thousand. Yeah, there’s heaps, and they range from sole traders… They could be sole traders up to the top 10, which might have a few thousand employees. There’s a really wide range of sizes of businesses.  Rob Walling:That’s a big market to not have a really well-built tool. When I think of any market in the US that has a couple hundred thousand businesses that would be willing to pay, there are a lot of tools available for them. Many of which are decent, some of which are reviled. But I’m kind of surprised by that. Why do you think that that vertical… There are probably listeners right now, salivating, thinking, “Oh, my gosh, I wish I could…” Only two years ago, there was a market this big that didn’t have software. Why is that the case? Why has no one attacked this?  James Mooring:I think there’s certainly a software that exists, but it was built 10 years ago, 6 years ago. They got into the space and they probably solved the problem that existed six years ago and thought, “Great. We’ve solved it.” I mean, this is my opinion anyway. And then I think they said, “Great. We’ve solved it. Let’s just stay here,” and that’s fine. But at the pace that the technology moves, at the pace that NDIS itself moves, you need to be able to iterate fast and change and listen and pivot, and I think that is another huge factor to our success. So there’s certainly a software that existed, but just not up to speed, I suppose.  Rob Walling:So as you’re building the… You start in June of ’21 writing the code. Six, seven months later, you’re in January 2022 and you launch a free Chrome extension, which… You talk about NDIS has a price guide and the Chrome extension allows you to search the price guide in real time, I guess, in Chrome.  James Mooring:Yeah.  Rob Walling:My question for this one… I have a note next to it, and it says, “Smart or lucky,” because a lot of engineers want to do engineering as marketing because we are builders. If I can write code instead of marketing or if I can write code as marketing, I’m going to do that, right? So what I wonder is if… Were you pretty calculated about this? Like, “Yeah, I’m all in. I’m in on this. It’s a lead gen. I’m going to build this thing. It’s going to do it,” and you were confident? Or was it kind of like, “Well, might as well throw this thing together. Maybe it’ll work, maybe it won’t.”  James Mooring:It came about because Jona and I were actually… Because we had to have some of this price guide functionality in Astalty to kind of get your business set up. I think we were looking at the price guide and we were like, “Man, this sucks. I can’t believe we have to search through this.” And then somehow, we got onto the concept of extensions, and I’ve never built one. I thought, “I wonder how hard it would be just to throw this in the browser,” because we use quite a few extensions and they’re just so handy. And then, I guess, we were calculated in the sense that we could use it as a lead gen, get our name out there. We were calculated in that way. Did we think it would have the uptake that it did? No. But when we built it and when other people started using it, everyone was thinking, “Why doesn’t this exist already?” So we were kind of first doing that and then we’ve seen a couple of others come along. But yeah, I would say maybe a combination of, “We know what we wanted to do. Did we know exactly what the pathway would be?” Probably, not. No.  Rob Walling:Right, so a combination, a lot of things. And then the next month, February ’22, you launched Astalty Lite, which, as you said, is a free-to-use CRM that would hopefully get customers engaged and on the platform. By August of that year, you had 450 users to the free platform and you specifically said, and I like this data point, “Of those, a few dozen were engaging us and providing feedback about the platform,” because that usually what happens. You get hundreds or thousands of free users and there’s 2%, 3% that are likely to upgrade. So similar with this one, you kind of went freemium or free… I guess the first question is, is that still a free plan on Astalty? Or is that just kind of a preview, so you do still have a free plan?  James Mooring:We do. It’s not very utilized because it doesn’t have your invoicing, which is such a core time saver that Astalty gives you. We do still have it.  Rob Walling:Similar with that, were you smart there to be like, “Oh, if we get this, we get the buzz and we get people in it”? Or did you kind of get lucky because, I’ll just say, most free offerings don’t work. Most people don’t know how to do it and they kind of backfire and you devalue your product and then you have a bunch of… on and on and on. But it seems like it worked… I guess the question is, did it work for you and was it intentional or was a little lucky in that one?  James Mooring:Astalty Lite was very calculated, absolutely. So when we were building, we were thinking… I think, by that time, we were thinking we would have our paid offering out, and that just didn’t happen. I think by the time we got to Astalty Lite being launched, we wanted to have our paid offering out and we wanted to get to the market early and we thought, “The best way to do that is to give people the functionality because we also needed feedback from our potential customers.” So it was a way to provide value, which was good for our engagement, getting a brand awareness, and also good to get people using the product. Did we know that people would actually use it? Probably, not. But even though it wasn’t, I guess, validation, which is something that I didn’t even know at the time or we didn’t know at the time, the fact that people were actually engaging and giving us feedback even though they weren’t buying, for us, was a very good signal that people are enjoying what we’re building. Some of those customers now pay us every month, so it’s great.  Rob Walling:What would the signal have been? Let’s say barely anyone signed up for Astalty Lite, because I almost view it as a nice MVP or a validation signal where you were kind of still like, “Well, are people using it?” And when they are, you’re like, “Oh, this raises my motivation,” because that’s what you need as a bootstrap founder is motivation, right? You’re not running out of money, but you’re like, “Ah, should I keep building this?” or, “Is this the right thing?” or whatever. So, it sounds like it was pretty motivating. What would you have done if 10 people signed up and no one used it? Would it have been bail on the idea, “This isn’t going to work”?  James Mooring:No, absolutely not. And this is a pretty important point, I guess, for me because I put my whole other software development company on hold and we were going to make Astalty work, period. There was no second option. So if that didn’t work, we would’ve pivoted, we would’ve reached out to people, we would’ve done whatever it took to make that work. I think in your book or on a podcast, you talk about roadblocks versus speed bumps, and this is something that we try and really put into practice that we would’ve just changed. We would’ve pivoted, got more feedback, changed the product, and go from there.  Rob Walling:So, that was February of ’22. So then, in August, you essentially launched a paid plan, Astalty Pro, Astalty Professional, 50 bucks a month per user, and you gave a discount at launch. 50 bucks a month per user, that’s decent pricing. Again, a lot of startups when they launch, I’m like, “Oh, they’re 10% of the price. They should be 10x below or 5x below. But at 50 per seat, I’m imagining… You said there are teams of thousands literally. But even if a team of 10, right? You’re talking $500 average revenue per account on that. Did you look at competition? How did you come to that price? Because it seems like you’re pretty smart on it.  James Mooring:Lots and lots of hours. People think building software is hard. Pricing is the hardest part of-  Rob Walling:Tell me about it.  James Mooring:It was extremely, extremely difficult. And I think we did the discount because we thought, “Oh, well, if we launch at a 30% discount and 49 is too expensive, then at least we can kind of revert down to that 30% off.” We did look at some of our competitors and we were cheaper than some and more expensive than some. I guess what was really interesting is the fact that we stayed at 49 and we probably tripled the number, the functionality that you could do through the platform. And our customers, I guess, had that trust in us that we were going to deliver on what we said that we were going to deliver. We got it right, I think, in the end. But yeah, it was lots and lots of time on the phone talking about it.  Rob Walling:Obviously, I’ve been thinking about your business for approximately 25 minutes or something. I don’t know it that well, but it feels directionally correct of like, “50 bucks a seat, that’s a pretty good price.” To get a full picture, obviously I’d want to look at all your competition and… There’s a bunch of other stuff, but it certainly doesn’t seem too terribly low. I guess it started paying off, right? Because by December of that year, you launched in August, you’re five months, six months later, is that even… or four or five months later, you’re at almost 9,000 MRR, which is a kind of a Cinderella story, right? I mean, how many people are listening to this podcast thinking, “I’ve been working on this… I’ve been launched for two or three years and I’m not at 9K MRR.” Aside from getting the things right that you got that we’ve already covered, was there something else? Are you a good marketer? Is your co-founder doing a lot of marketing? How is there so much interest and fast growth? I mean, you got a couple hundred paying users in that five months. What was the key there?  James Mooring:I think the biggest key is that the product was so good, and that’s a combination of Jona, my co-founder, having such a good understanding of the NDIS and being able to translate that into software and the fact that the businesses that use our software essentially charge $100 an hour for their service. So, we only had to save our customers half an hour a month per user to see the value. And our invoicing alone was saving businesses, in some cases, two whole days, a fortnight. So it becomes very easy, I think, for our customers to justify the cost. In the early days, we just did everything. We were both doing the demos, we were getting on calls with the smallest users. If it was a five, we would literally be building features to get customers in that it was missing. So, we were just doing everything we had to do to get these customers on board. Like I said, my business partner have such a good understanding of the NDIS. I think we were able to leverage his network and his knowledge of what people are really looking for.  Rob Walling:Got it. Yeah, you’ll hear me say is, if you listen to the podcast, “Build your network, not your audience.” So, it sounds like he… You guys didn’t have an audience of NDIS folks, but he did have a network of folks who would be willing to try it to give feedback to potentially spread the word.  James Mooring:Yeah, exactly. If you can go to a business and say, “Hey, pay us 50 bucks a month for a sole trader,” for example, “and we’ll save you 10 hours a month,” it’s kind of hard to say no to.  Rob Walling:That raises the question, do you feel like you might be underpriced? Could you charge $100 a seat or 150? What is the place where that breaks? Usually, it’s if there’s a replacement, it’s they can either do it with a clipboard, Excel spreadsheet, or there’s other software where they’re just like, “Forget it, I’m not… Even though this is the best tool, there’s an alternative that is good enough.”  James Mooring:The pricing scales well for all sizes of businesses we feel. So, we didn’t want to make our pricing complicated, “You have one user, you’d pay this. You have five users, you pay that.” I just wanted the billing to be super straightforward. So I feel like our price point, maybe we could charge more for smaller businesses. But then if you have say 20 users or 30 users, it does start to get quite expensive each month. So we charge the same for all sizes of businesses at the moment, and we’re comfortable with that. Could we charge more? Maybe, but I guess you don’t know until you actually try it, right?  Rob Walling:So you end 2022 at just under 9K, you end 2023 at almost 60K MRR, so the story continues. Did anything change? Did you do anything differently during ’23 to get to that? I mean, you’re 6x, you’re approaching a million already. Was it more the same? Or was there anything during that year that just lit a fire under the growth?  James Mooring:I think because we had such good word-of-mouth, our reach was kind of exponential. The more users we had, the more people that were talking about our product, the more people that would see that. So, it was kind of like a self-fulfilling hamster wheel in the sense that we just got more people really enjoying using the product and they would tell two people and then they would tell two people each. So that kind of grew, our user base, quite quickly. We also did some offers, three months free, we did a Black Friday sale, so that stuff sort of drove our growth. And we always ask ourselves, “Would they have joined even if we didn’t do those offers?” I’m not sure. It doesn’t really matter now. Funnily enough, we only made our first hire in October of that year. I think more people were just talking about the product and, of course, we were adding more and more functionality that we needed as well. So, we were kind of growing the market that we could sell to.  Rob Walling:And this is something I want to call out to someone listening. This is the reason that, at the beginning of this year when I made predictions for 2024, I said vertical SaaS and, later added, orthogonal SaaS, which is like role-based or title-based, will continue to be incredible places for bootstrappers. We’ve kind of been seeing that over the past few years but even more, and there’s reasons for this and you’ve pretty much enumerated all of them. One is that word-of-mouth in small verticals is like wildfire, way more than… The examples I always bring about horizontal SaaS are like SignWell and SavvyCal, right? Word-of-mouth can be fine, but it’s not wildfire in those spaces, versus Gymdesk and Astalty where it travels real quick. The other thing is the folks in these verticals hang out in the same spaces. They’re in the Slack groups, they’re in the Facebook groups, they’re at the same in-person events. If they have a trade publication, a magazine or something, it goes to 50,000 to 100,000 people. It’s very small in the scheme of things. It’s not so big. In addition, marketing in these spaces usually is either not that expensive or not very well done. You’re not competing against Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Netflix. Netflix [inaudible 00:24:21] an example. But these other companies, if you were building a Google Docs competitor for example, not only does your product have to be incredible because these horizontal products are usually pretty good or have a lot of features at least, but your marketing has to be that. Astalty’s in the NDIS provider space, the space I had never heard of, before looking at your H1. And then pricing’s the other one is usually you can just charge a lot more. If I’m buying Microsoft Word or competing against Google Sheets, you know that the price goes to zero. If I build Microsoft Word for academics who write in Hebrew or whatever, I should charge 10, 20 times Microsoft Word at least. You, in this space of like, “Well, couldn’t someone use Basecamp or Salesforce to do their NDIS?” You know what I mean? It’s like, “Aren’t there horizontal tools?” Yeah, probably, but you should be able to charge… For a specialized tool, you have pricing power because you’re not a commodity. Whether you can charge more or not is one part of the question. But the other one is that you do in fact… Your pricing is not going to zero.  James Mooring:Yeah, and there’s two really important things that we did that you just mentioned. So the first one is that we actually go to in-person events, which is probably an important piece that I missed. We were aware of these events and, essentially, the person… It’s kind of like a speed dating setup. You sit down, there’s a circle on the other side of the table and they all rotate. You give five minutes to sell your thing. The customers on the other side were kind of like 80% our ideal customer, and we were thinking, hopefully they’re not listening, “Why none of our competitors going to these things?” So we started going and they have been fantastic because we could actually demo the product right in front of them and our product was the best marketing that we had. So, that was another key to our success. And the other thing was around Facebook groups. So, a lot of these businesses do hang out in Facebook groups. I really remember in the early days, people would go into these Facebook groups and we’d search for the keyword software and we’d think, “I wonder if anyone’s asking what software to use.” So many people would be, “What CRM are you using? What software are you using? How do you handle your invoicing?” and they’d be saying all these different companies. And Jona and I said, “Wouldn’t it be nice if that was Astalty getting talked about there?” This happens fairly frequently now. Three days ago, somebody asked, “What software should we use?” And I think there was 22 comments, and 20 out of the 22 were Astalty. And not just Astalty but, “Astalty is great. I wish I went to Astalty earlier. I talked to Astalty, the support is amazing.” So all of our reviews are actually more… And if you look at Google as well, all the reviews are really in depth. They take the time, and I feel like that’s a very good indicator that people enjoy being here and just being part of the Astalty community and network.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and that’s great to have that. Here’s the assessment I asked Jason Fried years ago on MicroConf like, “Why did Basecamp work?” And he said, “Luck and timing were one and two, but we also did a lot of things right.” I don’t think luck and timing were one and two for you actually. I think the fact that you had a co-founder who really was deep in the space and that you’re obviously a gifted product person we’re probably one and two and I think you did a bunch. And there’s luck somewhere in there, and then I think you also did a lot of things right. That’s one of them of you said your support is lightning fast. I think your average response time is 45 minutes or something. You’ve obviously really cared a lot about your customers. Someone can listen to this and, any of these things individually, you can’t cherry pick these. You can’t say, “Well, I’m just going to do that one, and I’m just going to do that one and it’s going to succeed.” It’s like you need a lot of these in the same direction. And in yours case, we could pull some of these off and you still would’ve been successful. If your support was not amazing, you’d probably still be winning because I think your incumbents are just not great. I having never used them, I know what type of software that is. So I think some of these you could have left, but I think the combination of all of them is what makes a big difference.  James Mooring:I was just going to say on that point, in the early days, these all feel like one percenters and they feel like, “This is making no difference.” When a customer signs up and I call them, that’s not going to make a difference at all. But when you kind of compound that effort over months and years, then you see the payoff, and it’s not that hard to do. While you need to duck out, go to the grocery store, pick up the kids from daycare, jot down a customer’s number and just call them. How many times have you signed up to a software platform and got a phone call, not from a sales person, but just from somebody saying, “Hey, welcome to ABC product. If there’s anything I can do, just sing out.” I honestly can’t remember the last time, if any time, that’s happened to me. And that’s something that we do. So a lot of these things, people were just so refreshed because a lot of our competitors don’t have phone support. In the early days, we’re thinking, “This is going to be painful, but let’s do it anyway,” and they are painful in the early days and they feel like they’re not making a difference. But if you stick with it, eventually, if you invest time into your customers, they’ll give it back to you 10x, 100x in some cases.  Rob Walling:Before I move on to what I think will be my last question for you, I did want to call back to… You and I were just talking about in-person events and you were mentioning how valuable they were, and that would have been my guess actually. I don’t think it was in the timeline. You and I hadn’t talked about it, but I would’ve guessed for this business, negative churn, which you have, and in-person events. So I have these things, I call them the big five, B2B, SaaS marketing approaches and its content, SEO, cold outreach, integrations, partnerships as one, and ads. So I haven’t written on this thing, I refer to it all the time. But my next five depend on the type of business and it depends on the lifetime value and all this stuff. My next five are in-person events, free tools, so like engineering and marketing, podcast tour, affiliates, and Capterra or G2, and I separate those from ads even though they’re kind of same thing. The events one, when it works, it really works and it works usually in tight verticals and you need a high enough annual contract value to make it work. So, it definitely fits my kind of mind map of your type of business, of this vertical with a 50, $60 per seat price point with all that. It’s not surprising to me at all how valuable the in-person events have been for you.  James Mooring:Jona, my co-founder, he’s actually working really hard. We’ve just launched a partners and affiliates program as well. So we have a lot of consultants in the space, as you can imagine, being a complicated area. So now, we’re engaging with consultants and other businesses that have similar customer base and trying to partner with them. And we’ve got an affiliate program, refer a friend, we’ve got ongoing commissions where we’re kind of doing all these things now, which is again just kind of compounding on everything else that we’re doing, which is fantastic.  Rob Walling:I want to leave us on this high note of you did a very clever price increase, and I don’t even know if you would call it a price increase. The way you described it to me was I was like, “I don’t know that I’ve ever heard anyone do it this way.” I want to bring it up so that someone listening might think about doing it the same way. So we talked about how you had Astalty Pro or Professional, you still do, that is a tier of the software, $49 a month, and that’s how you’ve been for two years. So just a couple of months ago, in February of ’24, you launched Astalty Premium that was an early access, new price point, $64 per user per month, and you had built a bunch of functionality. You didn’t just want to throw it in the 49, so you built Premium. So not only did you get a bunch of people upgrading from Astalty Pro, but you said… If you go to the pricing page right now, it’s kind of hidden, it’s that you say, “We kind of hide Professional,” so you must be able to click a link and get to it or something so that actually most people are signing up at $64 a month and getting full functionality. Did I summarize that correctly?  James Mooring:Yep. Yeah, exactly. Exactly, and I think when we launched… Within the first week, 30% of our existing customers upgraded straight away.  Rob Walling:Interesting. So if you had gone in and just said, “Hey…” This is the hack, this is the cleverness, is you could have put all those features and all that functionality into Pro and then said, “By the way, we’re raising your price to 64 because we launched this stuff,” and guess what? Some people would’ve been cool with it and some people would’ve been really pissed, but you actually launched a separate plan that’s too close. $15 is too close. If you told me I was going to do 49, 64 as my price points, I’ve been like, “No, no, no. Move them far apart,” but you were kind of going for a incognito price increase. This sounds like it was pretty deliberate.  James Mooring:Yep, and the price difference was also very deliberate. We wanted it to be a no-brainer and Professional’s actually now $59 a month for new customers, so it’s only $5 extra, and we gave everybody on Professional a four-week trial. The Premium features are pretty sticky. You can generate contracts, you can send things for e-signing, you can track documentation. There’s a lot of things that are built in that are super, super valuable. And we said, “Well, let’s just give everybody four weeks to give this a go.” It’s kind of like once you get a taste of it, you don’t want to not have it. And then we kind of changed our pricing page. I think 98 or 95% of new customers signed up to the $64-a-month plan, which is fantastic. So, yeah, we kind of did a price increase without doing a price increase.  Rob Walling:End of this year, are you doing 79, 79 a month for Astalty Gold? Is that where we go next? Astalty Platinum?  James Mooring:79 was actually going to be the price point of premium and we thought, “Let’s bring it down and try and go for more volume,” and I’m very glad with did because I think 79 would’ve been a little bit too… Once you kind get up around the 7s, 8s, 9s, those numbers start to look a lot bigger, especially for bigger teams. When we launch the kind of next functionality, which is scheduling and rostering, we will actually have a cheaper price point for that because the user type is different. They’re only going to be on the platform a few hours a week, things like that. But it’s all about for us trying to make Astalty, not just the software, but through our partners, through our resources, through the software itself, through the support, just a place that you want to be. I use this analogy of not choosing the least worst option, and I think about tools like Slack as one of those. You choose Slack as the least worst option to solve that problem for you, right? And then, I don’t know if you know a tool called Linear, which is an issue tracking kind of like Jira. Whenever I use Linear, I think, “I enjoy using this software, I want to use this software,” and we want people to feel the same way about our software. And you can’t do that just through product or support or resources. You kind of have to have everything, “Come to us and we’ll look after you, whatever you need. If we can’t do it, we’ll let you know about somebody who can.” So, we’re just about providing value and I think people really appreciate that. It’s quite refreshing as well.  Rob Walling:Yeah. James, big congratulations on you and your co-founder’s success. You’ve built a heck of a business. I hope, as listeners have heard this, that they take a bunch of things away that you did a lot of things right and that you and your co-founder made smart choices. There was probably some luck involved in a few of them, but I think you would’ve succeeded with almost minimal luck because of all the things that were in place, like your founding team construction, I already talked about, developer plus subject matter expert. You backed off on building an entire CRM and instead you built just the support coordination piece of it. You limited the scope you marketed before you were coding, right? You built the Chrome extension. You built Astalty Lite as marketing. You picked what sounds like a market with kind of a big hole in it. You built vertical SaaS. You increased your prices multiple times. You priced well from the sell. You did a lot of things right.  James Mooring:I just want to kind of point out the other thing about doing things right. If you’re not (beep) things up along the way, you’re not going to get there. It’s more about being able to not be afraid of being wrong. If you get it wrong, change fast. And the speed of being able to iterate is super, super important. The quicker you can eliminate the wrong things to do, the faster you’ll arrive at the right things to do. So I think it’s kind of nice that we get to this point and everyone’s like, “Well, you did all these things right.” Now, sure. But when you’re going through that process, you do do a lot of things wrong, and that’s absolutely fine. If you’re not doing things wrong… That’s where you learn what’s not going to work. So, I think that’s just an important point.  Rob Walling:I like that a lot. That’s something Einar and I tell to our TinySeed companies all the time of like, “You got to move fast. You’re going to make some bad decisions, you’re going to make some wrong decisions, but you need to do a lot of things such that you work mostly on the right things.”  James Mooring:Like Ben Chestnut says, “Stab in the dark, but stab very fast.”  Rob Walling:Exactly. Super impressive, man. It’s a great business you built. If folks want to see what you’re up to, they can go to astalty.com.au. And is there anywhere else online that you hang out, to look for? I don’t think you have a Twitter account, but is there anything that… Is it LinkedIn where people could maybe keep up with you?  James Mooring:Yeah, LinkedIn is probably the best place. I’m kind of on Twitter, but not super active there, but certainly on LinkedIn.  Rob Walling:So folks who want to find you on LinkedIn, you are James Mooring, M-O-O-R-I-N-G, and you live in Australia. I don’t know how… On LinkedIn, what if there’s 25 James Moorings? How are they going to know it’s you? Oh, Astalty, right? That’s going to be the… You need one more piece. When I search for people’s names in Google and I’m like, “James Mooring Twitter,” and there’s like 20 of them, so then I usually throw in the company name and that gets me there. So James, once again, thank you so much for joining me on the show today.  James Mooring:Not a problem. Thanks. Really appreciate it.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to James for joining me on the show, and thanks to you for joining me this week and every week. I did a call for more advanced questions because obviously a lot of the questions that I get on the show are from folks looking to validate ideas, are just very early stage, and that’s fine. But I know that there are a lot of listeners to the show that are doing 10k, 100k, 300k a month or more. There are folks out there right now thinking, “Yeah, I’m doing a lot more than that.” And I don’t want to give the impression that this show is only for new folks just getting started. There’s so many people doing seven and eight figures in the MicroConf community, in the TinySeed community, and even in the Startups For the Rest of Us audience. So if you saw my question on Twitter, thank you for responding. I’ve got 10, 15 really good questions that are for folks who are building great businesses and not just about early stage stuff. And of course, I will continue to accept those and answer them in future episodes. You can always submit questions by going to startupsfortherestofus.com. Hit Ask a Question in the top and ask them there, or you can respond to me on Twitter. Thanks so much.

I’m your host this week and every week. And in this week’s episode, Asia Orangio and I talk through 7 key takeaways from the 2024 State of Independent SaaS Report. There are many more findings or takeaways than just seven, and of course you can download the complete report at stateofindiesaas.com. But here in this episode, Asia and I talk through our thoughts about the report and some key findings. And without further ado, let me welcome Asia to the show. Asia Orangio, great to have you back on Startups For the Rest of Us.  Asia Orangio:Yes, thank you so much again for having me. Always a pleasure.  Rob Walling:So it’s been awesome working with you this year on the State of Independent SaaS Report. So for folks who aren’t aware, this is our fourth report that we’ve done over the course of five years, and we survey our entire … All the MicroConf, TinySeed, Startups For the Rest of Us audience. And this year we got, I believe you were just telling me it’s just under 700 usable responses, and that’s statistically significant. I’ve seen other reports done with 2 to 300 folks responding, and so these numbers start to have some meaning at that point in my opinion. But this year you helped do some data analysis and had some pretty interesting findings that we’re going to talk about in this show. Now, I do want to say one note before we dive in, is we talk a little bit about slides and visuals and such, and it’s because we have used part of this episode on the YouTube channel. And if you go to microconf.com/youtube, you’ll be able to watch this video and see the full slides. But if not, we did talk through the findings so that if it’s audio only, you should be able to follow. So I’m curious, from your perspective, State of Independent SaaS Report, what do you see as the value to something, to putting something together like this? Because you reached out and said, “I know you’ve done three of them, you’re probably going to do another one. Do you want some help with it?” And obviously that means you have an interest in it, and you feel like there’s some benefit to the community to have a report like this. So tell me your thoughts on that.  Asia Orangio:Absolutely. So I was just counting the other day, how many founders have I worked with over the last six years that I’ve been running to DemandMaven, and it’s over 100. It’s well over 100 if we count how many people I’ve advised, how many people I’ve just consulted just in a call. And I get so many questions about how am I doing? How am I doing a comparison to my peers? And also there’s tons of just market research data and reports like this about the SaaS industry as a whole. But when it comes to indie SaaS and bootstrapped companies and founders, there just is not nearly as much. And I’ve always looked at the State of Indie SaaS as like this is the report for a lot of my clients and I get so many questions that I just can’t answer because there is no stat, there is no … No one’s dug deep into this. And so I was working with a founder more recently and I remember he had really good questions about, “Okay, yeah, I know what the stats are for the average activation rate, for example, of average SaaS companies and PLG, but what about my peers and bootstrappers?” And I remember thinking, I don’t have an answer to that, but I would refer to the State of Indie SaaS a lot. And so I was very motivated by what are some additional questions that we can ask? What are some other data points that we can collect to help support founders? And I think this specific report was we leaned a little bit heavier on the operations side because I was getting lots of questions from founders about how to structure their teams, how to think about their tool set and what they’re using. And then also pretty much everyone I talk to is always wondering, “Well, what about my specific context?” So anyway, so that’s a little bit of backstory around the motivation and what I … Me kind of feeling like, well, I can’t answer these questions, but maybe I can. Maybe I can help get answers to this and clear a little bit of the fog and debunk some myths about what this looks like.  Rob Walling:And that’s the reason we started doing it actually, was for exactly that reason. I would see the state of SaaS or the state of venture capital or the state of this and the growth rates, if you don’t have 200% year over year every year, blah, blah, blah, you can’t … And it’s just like, well, yeah, that’d be nice, but that’s not the game we’re playing. And so I was talking it over with my team back in, I think it was 2019 when we first started talking about doing this. And it was like, “What would it take to do this? How hard would it be? And what are the questions that we want to ask?” And look, the data in this report is, it’s directionally correct. It is a data point, it is a lighthouse on the … It’s not the exact prescription or 100% infallible. It’s like any other statistic. It can tell a story and it can be made to tell different stories. But especially the first report, it was so eye-opening. I just had no idea what percentage of bootstrapped, mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies asked for a credit card upfront. I had a feeling that it was like X%. I remember I used to tell people, “I think based on TinySeed and MicroConf, like my gut is this.” And it turned out to be relatively close, but it was so neat to not just have to save my gut to actually be like, “Oh, here’s a screenshot of that page.” And then recently, it probably happens every four or five months, someone on X, Twitter will say, “What’s the most popular country in the world or city in the world for bootstrappers? Where are all the bootstrappers?” And it’s like, well, we have this data, at least for our bootstrappers, the 700 or so folks who responded. The tough part for me has always been naming the report. Originally when I first came up with it, I was like, “I want to call it the State of Bootstrapping.” That was this report. And then I realized, A, is it really bootstrapping or is it bootstrapped SaaS? So then I was like, “Well, it’s State of Bootstrap SaaS.” So then it’s like, okay, so can people who raised funding, let’s say they take a little bit of money from TinySeed, can they no longer respond? Because those are mostly bootstrap companies and I think they should be in the report because they’re in a similar community and a similar economic boat. They’re venture capitalists who will say, “If you’ve raised less than a million dollars, you are effectively bootstrapped.” That’s how they view it. And for me, usually the number is in the 250 to 500K. I think that’s when you start to transition and like, “Oh, you’re pretty well … You’re reasonably well funded.” So coming up with Independent SaaS is like, I had to coin a term to basically be like, how do I … Because I can’t say the State of Bootstrapped and Mostly Bootstrap SaaS. It’s too cumbersome. So anyways, but before we go on, if you want to go to stateofindiesaas.com, you can download the report that Asia and I will be talking through today. And we have each brought a handful of findings and I’ll say thought-provoking insights that have some of which are puzzling. And I’m like, I didn’t expect that. And others it’s like, oh, this is totally in line and this supports my view of the world. If you could pick one finding that it most supports your view and one that was completely surprising, do you remember what those might be?  Asia Orangio:Yeah, the one that just makes me feel very validated …  Rob Walling:I love it.  Asia Orangio:Is, it’s got to be the model. So I get tons of questions from founders about, “Okay, but what are the average growth rates?” Ironically enough, I don’t think that we asked … We did ask about activation rate, but we didn’t ask for the specific number, which to be fair, how you define activation rate is its own thing, which is why we didn’t do that. But when it comes to like LTV churn and month-over-month growth, a lot of founders have questions about, “Well, which model is ‘the best?'” And I think the answer at the end of the day is going to be, it depends. It depends on your market, it depends on what your product is, all those things. But the thing that still made me feel like yeah, was when it comes to freemium versus free trial and then within free trial opt in versus opt out or basically credit card required versus credit card not required. So when it comes to not requiring a credit card on the free trial, this is actually the model that I recommend the most to bootstrapped founders because you do get more data in, but not so much data like you would in freemium, but not so little like you would with requiring the credit card. And what we found, what was surprising to me was growth rate actually was much higher when you required the credit card. But when you didn’t require the credit card, it wasn’t as high of a growth rate and churn was also okay. But not requiring the credit card gave you two times the LTV, which made me feel like, okay, yeah, so more money in the pocket. But to your point, this is so contextually dependent, it’s possible that the people who responded who don’t require the credit card just simply have better monetization, they’re charging more, maybe they’re targeting an industry that they’re able to charge more. All of those things are certainly contextualized. And then I think the thing that also just kind of validated my perspective personally was freemium not being as successful, but I think that’s just because too many founders don’t know how to make it work. There’s not enough education about how to make freemium work and also what are the right contexts that you really should consider freemium, and then what are the resources you need to make freemium work? It’s a much different ballgame than free trial in general. But that’s what definitely made me feel validated. And then also low-key surprised me. I would’ve expected not requiring the credit card on the free trial just would’ve been way better, but it actually technically wasn’t on the month-over-month growth side, but it was on the LTV side.  Rob Walling:And so for folks to have context, we are running this State of Independent SaaS survey every two years and we kick out the report a few months later, and as I said earlier, if you go to stateofindiesaas.com, you can view and download the report for yourself. And with that, let’s dive in to some of the findings. You and I are going to go back and forth with findings that we pulled from the report. Let’s dig in to your first finding. We are going to each have four that we’re sharing today, but talk to us about founder count.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, okay. I love this topic of conversation because, well, first and foremost, solo founders, of course, you guys out there, you’re already making growth waves, you’re already doing the thing. And on average and also the median, we typically saw on average it was around 17% month-over-month growth. When it came to the median, I think most … So just for context too, median represents more of the, this is what most people are probably experiencing, and the average of course is the number that you get after looking at the entire dataset. Even still month-over-month growth, still looking pretty good. What I think is interesting though is there’s a little bit of a very slight diminishing return on the average when you look at founder duos, meaning there are two founders. But what I think is fascinating is once you get to founder trios, meaning there are three co-founders, this is when you start to see around two to three X average growth month-over-month. And I think that this is so interesting because I think the connotation of a trio is that maybe it goes a little bit slower, but actually I think having the third person probably … My hypothesis is that the third person probably breaks a lot of ties, so to speak. However, there are diminishing returns. Once you get to four or more, we start to see a dramatic drop-off when it comes to average month-over-month growth. Not that it’s terrible or poor or anything, it’s just not maybe as efficient as some of the other growth rates month-over-month. But I still think it’s really interesting.  Rob Walling:This has been relatively consistent since we started asking this question over the … Because this is the fourth report that we’ve done over five years, I think, and I’ve noticed this pattern in each of them. We could go back through the others, but I believe for some reason, and I’ve never been able to explain it, that why three founders perform significantly better than one, two, and certainly than four. I’ve always been … With bootstrappers, we have the numbers in the report, I forget if it’s like 70% of mostly bootstrapped SaaS are single founders. It’s like a huge chunk. And then another 15+% is 2 founder companies, and that’s just the most common. I mean, that’s the lion’s share, 85%. And the more you get, I’ve seen four co-founder bootstrap companies, usually there’s a weak link is what it is. Usually there’s someone who shouldn’t, by my judgment, shouldn’t really be part of it. And you get too many cooks in the kitchen and people can’t, like you said, can’t break the ties, decision by committee. There’s all kinds of stuff. So it makes sense to me that at four, it’s too many. But I’ve always thought like, well, three is probably too many as well, but that’s not what our numbers have shown us each year.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, yeah. I would’ve assumed that more than two and you would start to see declines.  Rob Walling:Me too.  Asia Orangio:No, I was surprised as well. Way back in the day, I actually worked in-house for a company that had three … They had three co-founders. And I never would’ve guessed though that statistically speaking, at least in this dataset, it would imply the opposite. But it makes sense. But I remember the CEO at the time saying three was actually perfect for them because two can sometimes spend a lot of energy trying to make decisions, but not really going anywhere. And so the third person, especially if they were a strong force of nature so to speak, they were able to create momentum by again, tie-breaking, lots of tie-breaking, lots of like, “Okay, what do you think?” And then it’s like, “Okay, well I think it’s this” and so there’s actual momentum that happens. That’s the hypothesis. Of course, we don’t know exactly why, but yeah, I was surprised too, but two to three X is a lot. It’s a pretty big difference. Even on the median, it’s two X, which I think is really interesting. So that just tells me that this is something definitely to pay attention to and to think about.  Rob Walling:All right, for my first finding, we asked, “When a potential customer registers for a free trial, does your company request a credit card number to start the trial?” And what we looked at in this case is over the course of the 4 surveys we did from 2020 to this year’s 2024, and the findings are that the asking for a credit card upfront has increased and then decreased again. So the first year it was 73% asked for credit card upfront. Then it went up to 78%. 78% in the next one. And it’s down this year to 71%, so about a 10% drop. So it’s not precipitous, but I am curious, Asia to hear your thoughts on in the space, especially with bootstrap founders that you talk to, do you feel like the goalposts are moving for A, free trials, B, freemium and C, credit card upfront? Maybe start with credit card upfront because that’s what this slide is about, but have you seen that goalpost moving over the past several years?  Asia Orangio:Absolutely, absolutely. And there’s actually, we’ll get to this in a second, but I think that there’s some very real proof behind why more and more bootstrap founders are leaving behind requiring the credit card upfront. Yes, with the founders and the companies that I work with, absolutely. I think there’s a little bit of aha moment coming. It feels like there’s a communal aha moment happening around the opt-out credit card requirement or the opt-out free trial, which basically means you’re requiring the credit card. I think there’s a lot more movement towards opt-in free trial, and I think we’ll probably also discuss a little bit about freemium as well, but definitely, I’m absolutely seeing this. I have some hypotheses about why, but we’ll get into that in, I think, in one of the future slides that we’re going to cover.  Rob Walling:Yeah, my default has tended to be if I don’t have any other information, I ask for credit card upfront because usually I want to narrow the people who are going to try the software to folks who are actually interested and I think might pay. Now it depends though. It depends on the space. If the person who’s going to use the software is different than who’s going to pay for it, probably not the best idea because they don’t have a credit card. If a software developer at a certain company is going to use it but doesn’t have a credit card, then obviously you might need to allow free trial without a credit card. The thing, the mistake that I’ve seen folks do is either enact freemium where they then have the bootstrapping and using freemium where they push revenue down the line and maybe they don’t have the criteria in place to do it. But also then they get a lot of noise, especially in the early days. And similar with removing credit card, you can get more people in, you can get more feedback, and that’s the pro. The con is you get more people in and you get more feedback. And depending on how well you are at dealing with that, if you’re a first timer, that can be completely overwhelming. And so when I say I default to it, I mean it’s like a 60-40 for me. It’s not an always, never, but it’s like with no other information, that’s what I do. However, I think there’s a lot of leeway here for it to go up and down.  Asia Orangio:That’s so interesting because I’m the total opposite.  Rob Walling:Is it to get more data? What’s the reason that you would go with not having a credit card upfront for a free trial?  Asia Orangio:If you already have a really dialed in sense of who your customer is, then I think why put the limits on the free trial? And also I find that when you are able to get a little bit more information, I just feel like assuming that you have help and that you have experience in this, I’m actually very confident in my ability to detect, okay, who’s actually qualified? What do we got to do to activate people? I think to your point, if you’re less confident in your ability to do that, then yeah, require credit card upfront. Once you get to 10, 20, 50 paying customers, I think that you can take the credit card requirement off and create more of a pipeline for yourself. But again, the assumption is that you’ve got a pretty dialed in understanding of the customer. Considering that’s literally what I do, I’m pretty confident in like, okay, yeah, we don’t have to require the credit card upfront. Yes, I do think it makes sense though if you’re very, very early, may very new, first time founder, also new to SaaS, then requiring the credit card upfront will be a really good litmus test. So I see a lot of value for sure in that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s the key is I was referring to, if you don’t really know your ICP yet and you’re still trying to figure it out, so that’s the difference. Yeah, once you know your ICP, you’re driving traffic, your ideal customer profile for those listening or watching, that makes sense. I think we’re on the same page. All right, Asia, let’s talk about target market.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, this might sound really obvious, but I think that this slide just illustrates it and makes it visual for people because the market that you ultimately decide to focus on is going to have a huge impact on your growth rates. This also might not be that surprising when I say, but if you are targeting enterprise companies, traditionally speaking, your average month-over-month growth rate was probably like in the 26 or so percent. That’s pretty high actually for a company. That essentially means that you potentially more than double year over year, but there are some trade-offs depending of course on who you target. So for example, if I look in this chart here, towards the end we see consumers, so on average month-over-month growth rate looked closer to 5% for consumers. Government was pretty slow, 1.75. Now keep in mind this is the average. The medians reflected something very similar. But what was also interesting was depending on just how people respond to the survey, if they selected other, which to be honest, I was kind of having a hard time of what would other be? But if you were not really targeting any of these ideal customer types, then you probably saw contractions in growth. This could actually be due to a lack of focus. This could also just be maybe there are some consumer customer categories that just don’t fit within this model. But at the end of the day, who you target from a business perspective is going to have a lot to do with how you grow. That should be both … I think it should be seen a little bit as, I don’t want to say blessing and curse, but almost like setting expectations for yourself. So if you’re targeting, if you’re going B2C, if you’re going consumer, just have an expectation that growth might look a little bit different than if you’re B2B targeting enterprise or even mid-market. SMBs fell right in the middle, which probably not surprising. So if you were targeting small businesses, your average growth rate probably looked around like 12% month-over-month. But overall though, something to keep in mind. But yeah, Rob, I’m curious how you see this and how this reflects for you.  Rob Walling:Yeah. So for context, the top three fastest growing target markets are enterprise and mid-market, which is slightly smaller than enterprise, and NGOs or non-government organizations. I’m a little surprised the NGOs are there, but it is what it is. So those are the top three, which the first two certainly line up with my experience of at least having a dual funnel with enterprise and mid-market plus SMB. But with the TinySeed companies, we see the ones with the bigger ACVs, the ones with the bigger average revenue per account, per month, or per year do tend to be the ones that grow faster. On the bottom end, the bottom four are totally in line with what I would think. Aspiring entrepreneurs, education, selling into schools and academics, consumers, and then government. And yeah, none of those are really surprising to me.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, yeah. NGOs though, that makes me think that those software companies are solving a very big problem for them. That’s what makes me think that NGO is doing so well.  Rob Walling:I think the NGOs are probably enterprise or mid-market companies is my guess. We’ve broken them out because people … We used to have, well, we do have other, and people would write in NGOs, that’s our target market, and so we included it. But if you think about it, a lot of non-government organizations are actually large businesses and I think the first three all line up. So for our next one, we asked, “Do you plan to seek outside funding for your company within the next 12 months?” And I am glad we started asking this. I think we’ve only asked it for two years, but it was insightful for me the first year to realize this really gets sent out to the MicroConf, TinySeed, Startups For the Rest of Us ecosystem, which frankly, it’s mostly bootstrappers. It’s overwhelmingly folks who want to bootstrap and that’s fine. That’s okay. What I was surprised by was in 2022, 30% of respondents said they plan to seek outside funding within the next 12 months, and then in this year’s report it’s down to 23.5%. Now, a couple thoughts on that. Number one, it’s interesting that across all the TinySeed companies that we funded, somewhere around a third of them wind up seeking or raising additional funding. So that one third number, it seems to be something. This is even for companies who’ve taken an accelerator round from TinySeed. The other takeaways from year to year, if you heard me say 2022 is 30% and 2023 was about just under 24%. So there’s a decrease of 20, 20 something percent. I think that’s due to the funding environment. I’ll say this, the 2022 results were actually surveyed in fall of ’21 when things were still gangbusters. It was so easy to raise funding, everyone was thinking about it, everyone was doing it. The valuations were high, there [inaudible 00:24:14] going on, there was crowdfunding going on, all kinds of stuff. So I do think there was more of an appetite because it was just easier, money was cheaper. And this year’s survey taken, what? A couple of years later because we skipped a year in between is down to about 24%. And I’ll admit that’s just not that surprising. I think with funding being harder to raise kind of makes sense. You bootstrap until the money’s available and if the money’s never available, you just keep bootstrapping.  Asia Orangio:Funding being harder to raise, but then also terms not nearly as appealing as maybe they once were.  Rob Walling:There you go.  Asia Orangio:And then also I think there’s just like a … What was the quote from MicroConf most recently? “The exit strategy is death.”  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Asia Orangio:I think the culture is culturing when it comes to bootstrap in general. Yeah. But I also think it speaks maybe a little bit to the mental resilience of bootstrappers. I think a lot of people are learning about how to grow sustainably and also being maybe a lot more discerning about when does it make sense to get funding?  Rob Walling:And Asia for your next slide, we have a battle of the models. Talk us through this.  Asia Orangio:Oh yes, okay. It is one of my absolute favorite debates and it’s just because there isn’t really a right or a wrong answer, but the data is going to show us a couple of really interesting trends. So basically there’s of course offering freemium, then there’s the free trial. You can do opt-in free trial, which basically means that you don’t require a credit card upfront. And then there’s the opt-out free trial, which means that you do require a credit card upfront, you have to opt out of it. So when it comes to growth, churn and LTV, which we’re going to look at in here in a second, when it comes to growth overall, so what we find is free plans and free trials that do require a credit card, we’re going to see on average at least 10%. And for free trial credit card required, it actually is the highest. So 14% month-over-month average growth for companies that do that.  Rob Walling:Yes.  Asia Orangio:So requiring the credit card upfront does have a pretty big impact when it comes to initial upfront growth. And then not requiring the credit card had the least amount of month-over-month growth. This was about 7.6, we’ll call it 8% on average. And at first blush, that may seem like, oh, CC required for the free trial is the obvious answer and then maybe after that freemium. But not necessarily because now we have to look at churn. So for churn for the free plan, this was absolutely fascinating, but basically your month-over-month growth average, while it might’ve been 10.4 or 5%, churn was the same. It was almost 11% month-over-month average for churn. So basically freemium tended to see if you offered a free plan, you probably saw a little bit higher churn as well. When it comes to the free trial credit card required, the average for the month-over-month churn was 5.5%. Now, this was actually shocking to me because traditionally speaking, we tend to see really high churn numbers when you require the credit card upfront because people forget to cancel and they email you and they’re like, “Oh, I forgot to cancel. Can you cancel my thing?” And then ProfitWell and a lot of other subscription metrics will actually count that as churn, even though they might’ve just forgotten. So I was actually shocked to see that the average was about 5.5% on credit card required. And then finally not requiring the credit card on the free trial, 6.34, so a little bit higher. Now again, that might make you think, oh wow, not requiring the credit card on the free trial is the worst one. But then we’re going to look at LTV. But first I’ll pause here. I’m so curious, Rob, your gut reactions to this.  Rob Walling:It’s tough because it is averages, but my gut feel is typically that folks who are asking for credit card upfront, I would think that the churn for the first 30 or 60 days would be higher. But if they have their stuff dialed in, then beyond that, as long as they’re getting ICP, their ideal customer profile in because they are gating it with a credit card, kind of makes sense. That’s why I say it’s my default. Again, it’s a default. It’s a rule of thumb. It’s just a thing that I lean towards. So it does kind of make sense. It really makes sense to me that free plan, meaning freemium has, I’d say lower growth, but that the churn is high, which I guess this isn’t churn from the free plan. This is churn from the paid plans, which almost tells me the business is broken. And that’s the thing. Just bootstrappers using freemium in general usually means they don’t know what the (beep) they’re doing. That’s been my experience. You know what I mean? And I don’t mean that … I use that bad word only to imply that I just see it too often. It’s the same thing. People want to do B2C, they want to bootstrap a two-sided marketplace and they want to have freemium. I don’t know why they’re drawn to this like moths to a bug zapper, but it really is the most common questions that I get. I’ve just stopped taking these questions on the podcast. So the freemium part, kind of being a train wreck and the business being on fire, that makes a little more sense. The fact that free trial with credit card required performs better, at least with these averages, I think is in line with my experience, but it doesn’t … More questions to be asked is how I feel about it.  Asia Orangio:This is where I would say the story flips a little bit. So LTV, ultimately what that KPI speaks to is the lifetime value of the customer. So for as long as they spend with you, how much actual money do they spend on average across their entire experience with your product? And what we found was while the free trial credit card not required, certainly did not look as appealing month-over-month growth-wise or even churn-wise, what we found was it actually would have on average two times the LTV versus other plans. So for context, free plans and freemium, we saw an average of three K LTV. When we looked at credit card required on the free trial, it was about 3.6K LTV. Free trial and credit card not required, 6.5K, so easily 2X over freemium or free plans, and then of course a slight bump over the free trial credit card required. What this tells me is that while businesses might choose the free trial where the credit card is not required, what they’re basically trading off is faster, maybe upfront, month-over-month growth for basically more money in the pocket, which I don’t think you can be mad about. However, that’s not to say though that requiring the credit card upfront is not a good option. If anything, this makes me think that maybe monetization is a little bit broken for companies that tend to do the credit card required upfront. And then for freemium, it’s exactly what you said before. I think a lot of founders just don’t really understand how to make freemium work. How do you make it do the thing? But it also could speak to lower pricing plans and charging less in general because you’ve got freemium as your starting point. So it could also speak to that as well. So maybe monetization is a little bit broken here as well.  Rob Walling:Yeah, this one’s interesting for me because in our last slide we looked at growth rate and free trial with credit card required was growing significantly faster month over month than the others. But free trial credit card not required has significantly higher lifetime value even though the churn is higher. So it implies that without credit card required, that basically they’re charging more. I mean because for the LTV to be higher with higher churn means they have to be charging more.  Asia Orangio:Charging more, keeping more, I think, too potentially.  Rob Walling:This is where data can be made to tell a story because Asia and I could go on Twitter, X and we could say, “Well obviously based on this slide you should not ask for a credit card and we have data for it.” We could flip to the slide before. We could say, “Obviously by this slide, free trial credit card required allows you to grow faster.” And I won’t say it’s apples and oranges because they’re related, but it’s unclear. And honestly, this is why the answer is it depends. It really does depend on your space. It depends on your customer type, your ICP, it depends on your stage. If you’re $2,000 MRR versus 200,000 MRR, you have to take the data you can and the data you have and you use it to your advantage. And for our last slide, this one will be quick. I just like looking at it because the question we ask is, “Please select up to three advertising channels that have most significantly increased your revenue.” And the number one, 65ish% is Google AdWords. Number two with about half that, so around 30ish is Meta or Facebook ads. And then next is other, and fourth is LinkedIn. And every year I’m always like, I think Twitter ads are going to do something at some point and they never do. They’re always so far to the right. It’s like that Twitter ad ecosystem is terrible. Usually though I would expect LinkedIn to be third. Just in broader experience, it’s like it’s Google AdWords, it’s Facebook and it’s LinkedIn would be my top three that I would recommend to founders, B2B SaaS founders. The issue though is the LinkedIn ad tools are not great, and that’s what I’ve heard. And so TinySeed has invested in [inaudible 00:33:06], which is a SaaS that sits on top. It helps you manage and deal, basically get around LinkedIn’s crappy ad interface. You heard me say that, that’s not their marketing, that’s me just saying it’s pretty rough. The ad tech of LinkedIn is significantly behind Meta and AdWords. The thing that I want to dig into, and I wish I had this data with me today, is other advertising. I don’t exactly know what that is, and I bet we had a text field that people entered stuff. I’m curious if other advertising is advertising on podcasts, advertising or sponsoring events or display advertising. I can imagine those being an other. And so the fact that it’s ahead of LinkedIn might be just that it’s so varied. There’s so many different options that people kind of bucket it all in one.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, the LinkedIn thing is also not surprising to me. I think in order for LinkedIn to work, you’ve got to be targeting an audience that just actually lives on LinkedIn. I live on LinkedIn, that’s where I hang out now. So I’m not surprised that Meta, which includes Facebook and Instagram, I’m not surprised that Meta beats LinkedIn. And then of course Google AdWords. I mean this is bottom of the funnel keyword searching. Not shocking at all here. But yeah, LinkedIn, that’s awesome having the thing that sits on top of it. I agree, because it’s trash.  Rob Walling:Asia Orangio, if folks want to keep up with you on X, Twitter, you’re Asia Orangio and demandmaven.io if they want to find out what you do on a day-day basis with your growth consultancy.

I am Rob Walling, and today, I’m joined by Craig Hewitt, the founder of Castos and the host of the Rogue Startups Podcast. In this episode, Craig and I talk through several topics. One of which is prioritization, and we went pretty deep on that, both prioritizing things from a marketing or growth perspective, in general when you’re working on a startup, how do you think through what’s a framework for prioritization, and also, we talk how to prioritize balancing work and life. I also talked to Craig a bit about what it’s like to be a founder and to start doing some coaching of other founders, and we also talk about what it’s like to have a podcast with a co-host and then suddenly be a solo host. Before we dive into that, you should check out MicroConf Connect at microconfconnect.com. This is our online community and forum. We host it in Slack and we’re approaching 7,000 members. They’re bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. Recent conversations in Connect, including a debate about magic sign-in links, how long you should spend diving into a niche before deciding on the product offer, how to safeguard your product from misuse during free trials, at what point in your journey should you invest in a conference booth and more. It’s a vibrant and highly moderated community, very high signal to noise. If you’re looking to find and hang out with other misfits like you and I, head to microconfconnect.com. It’s a great episode today. I hope you enjoy the conversation. The Craig Hewitt, thanks for joining me on the show.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, man, thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:I hear from a lot of folks that they really enjoy the episodes of Startups For the Rest of Us that you’re on, so it’s good to have you back.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, man. Likewise. It’s not a lot of opportunities to riff and BS on startup stuff, and you’re one of my favorites to do it with. So, this is awesome.  Rob Walling:Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it’s nice to go deep with other folks that you have chemistry with. This is what people tell me about these types of episodes. There’s the Derek Grammer and the Rubin, where it’s like you just have a rapport is what they say. You have a common language and you get there real quickly and you go deep really fast on things because there’s not a presupposition of, “Oh, I need to be really polite and walk on eggshells here,” or “I can’t say what I really think.” It’s like, “No, we’ve known each other for a very long time.” Oh, more than a decade. It’s probably like 10, 12 years, I would think.  Craig Hewitt:I think so, yeah. Yeah.  Rob Walling:So anyways, I came up with a few topics to chat with you about and then I realized that last week I had some success just tweeting out, “Hey, what do you want me to talk about with Derek Grammer?”, who was on the show a couple of weeks ago when this airs. So, I did the same thing for you, and what I thought was funny was you responded with one of my favorite topics. I was like, “Wait, the guest responded with the topic.” So your tweet said, “I want to talk through how you think about prioritization both from a marketing growth perspective, but also work-life balance and stuff outside of work with only so many hours in the day.” You want to give more context around what you’re thinking there.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, I think part of it stems from just being a busy founder, have my own podcast, have content I’m doing, have a family, try to take care of myself and exercise, and try to have a garden. It’s summer and find myself looking at the calendar sometimes just being like, “This doesn’t add up.” So something’s got to give and I sometimes think I’m not doing the “right things”. So, I think that’s more so it’s like there are enough hours in the day if you prioritize the right things, and that’s within the eight hours of a workday and that’s within the whatever, however many hours we’re awake during the week. So, I don’t know. I would be very curious to hear how you think about it and I can share a little bit of what I think too, if that would be helpful.  Rob Walling:Yeah, for sure. I think we should both dive in on it. There’s a few things here. There’s a quote that I had in a talk one time that resonated with a lot of people, and I’ve said it a few times, but in your personal life, money saves you hours. In your business, money can save you years. What that means is if you have money in your personal bank account, you can pay someone to mow your lawn, your dishes, do your laundry. We have someone who comes to our house 5 or 10 hours a week and does errands and does basic stuff, $30 an hour, and then they’re local. They handle all kinds of returns and just anything you can imagine that an admin can do in person. It’s a hundred something dollars or 300, whatever it is. Sherry and I are two busy working professionals. We both have successful businesses for us at this stage that I’ll just say it’s a rounding error compared to we’ll go out to a really nice dinner with friends and spend that. So, it’s like that’s something that, and I’m getting it. I’m not saying everyone in the audience, you have $300 to waste on an assistant who comes in, but it’s like at a certain point, even early on, I started paying someone to mow my lawn. I remember I had friends who made fun of me for that and said, “You don’t want to put in the hard work,” or like “Oh, you’re a real bougie now, aren’t you?”  Craig Hewitt:Sideways.  Rob Walling:Yeah, these were the friends that I had to distance myself from to become an entrepreneur because they had this old script. Let’s say I was 25, 26 and I was making $60 an hour as a developer hourly. It was contract. I could work 10, 12, 14 hour days back then and I would get paid for 10, 12, 14 hours a day times 60. So, really the math was there. So, instead of me buying a lawnmower, maintaining it, and doing all this stuff, I would do that. I started hiring more out and I was really guilty about it for a long time of like, “Am I wasting money? Because I could just go do that on the weekend.” Same thing with cleaning my house, that was a tough thing for me to get over. So, that’s a very basic first one, but I think people don’t delegate or outsource enough in their personal lives. To be honest, man, is it easier to find someone to come into your business and do support, customer success, and train them on that, or is it easier to find someone who can run errands and do laundry and do a few things and the cost might be similar or less? So that’s a super tactical one to start with, but I want to toss it back to you in the sense of how you think about trying to prioritize these things.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, so totally on the money buys you freedom or time. Dan Martell’s book, really good, Buy Back Your Time. I know he’s been on the show, really, really good book from a business perspective. I’ve been on and off with assistants. Actually yesterday, two days ago, I signed back up with Zirtual. That’s how I had my assistant before, signed back up with them. I think they started like 500 bucks a month for 12 hours a month, so a couple hours a week. For me, it’s just like, “Can you take care of this notice from the State of Virginia that I literally have no idea what to do? Can you just please go take care of this?” They’re pretty senior level folks to where you can say, “I just don’t want to think about it until it’s done please. Here’s the SOP and the documentation, but solve this problem for me.” Outside of work, what I have tried to start doing is just less. Instead of just saying, “How can I possibly manage all these things?”, I’m just like, “I’m not doing that.” A good example is I was going to CrossFit for a while and it’s a really great workout at 44 now. It’s maybe a little too much for my old ass, but one of the challenges was it’s at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning. So, then that’s very fixed and the rest of my day has to fit around that. So, I’m like, “No, because what I need is a thing that can fit around my schedule.” So it’s like let’s break down the rigidity and the barriers to where I can just do my stuff whenever and however I want. So, I think that it gets at the same concept is like how can I bend the reality to fit more what I want? That’s been away from work. Something I’ve really tried to do is just optimize for convenience as much as possible. We haven’t gotten someone local, but that’s probably the next step is get somebody a couple hours a week to help with the house or stuff and groceries and things like that.  Rob Walling:So I actually contacted Zirtual and four other VA agencies and said, “Do you have anyone? I want someone local and I want an EA level person, but I want them in Minneapolis,” because I want them to be able to do the stuff you’re saying, which is this tax notice. Or I got something from my insurance company the other day, and again, it’s like, “I need you to make a phone call and I need you to figure this out,” or “I need you to change this plane flight. It’s going to be like 30 minutes on the phone with Delta. Can you just do it? But I also want you to be able to run these errands because there’s just enough in a week with us around.” We actually found a friend of a friend who’s doing it for us now, but more than that, I like what you said, it’s not just about hiring stuff out. It is about doing less. This is the thing I realized is again, going back to when I was 25, I would sometimes code 12 or 14 hours a day because it was just like, “I’m going to make money because I need to make money to pay the rent and to be self-sufficient.” Sherry and I were married already at that time. Then as I started becoming an entrepreneur, I transitioned into that mode where I’d work all day and then I would entrepreneur all night till 1:00 in the morning or something. So, I would work a lot and then even as I became an entrepreneur, I was like, “Well, I will just grind it out. That’s how I will win.” That was perhaps a good choice early on, but there’s a question mark on there because grinding it out and working 12, 14 hour days, which again, I did as both a contractor and then doing products for a while back when I had time, no kids, all this stuff. I worked on a lot of the wrong things. I wasted so much time, so much time. I mean probably half my time was wasted, maybe more where I just didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn’t asking for advice. I wasn’t following rules of thumb, didn’t have a plan. I just flailed around and did the next thing because I was like, “Well, I’m going to keep working. I’m going to keep working. I did stuff.” It took me a very long time to hone that ability to say no to a lot of things and pick. There’s no one right thing to work on.  Craig Hewitt:There’s a whole lot of wrong things.  Rob Walling:But there’s a whole lot of wrong things. If there’s 100 ideas, there’s probably like three or five that are probably in the 80, 90% correct. It’s in this direction. How do you identify those? How do you do that? Do you think about it?  Craig Hewitt:Yeah. So, I have a really good one there. So, this is on the work front. I have several people that I work with, I actually wrote about this in my Founder Insights newsletter last week. It’ll show up as a blog post on craighewitt.me if you want to go check it out. But what I’ve started doing is really leaning into having several different coaches in my life. So, I have a wellness coach from My Body Tutor. Amazing. Check it out if you haven’t. I have a sales coach now and I’m a sales guy, so I should know what I’m doing. But I think it’s a testament to even if you are the subject matter expert, having an objective third party unbiased person to bounce ideas off of and say, “Hey, I want to grow this part of my business. What do you think about this or this or this as an approach?” They with probably a whole lot more experience and context and perspective would say, “Well, obvious just do this.” Then I have a founder coach who at a higher level strategically, I’m able to say, “Hey, we want to do this,” or “We want to acquire this company,” or “We want to raise more money or whatever.” He’s able to really give me the same really honest feedback. So, that’s something I’ve really benefited from a lot in the last year or so is just not putting all the pressure back on me because as founders, you got to make so many decisions every day that especially as a solo founder to say, “I got to make this other decision,” and then it’s the next one and the next one and the next one. Some of them are really important and you have a mastermind group or you have a mentor or whatever, but you got to have somebody to talk to, I think, is the point. To me, paying someone who has actually done the thing is way more valuable than pretty much any other peer group because that is then the answer. You have a relatively high confidence that that’s right.  Rob Walling:If you can find someone that you trust in a domain to give you their best advice, and here’s the thing, if you trust them, it’s likely they will say things like, “I feel very strongly that you should do X” or… I’ll do this all the time with tiny C founders. I’m on the fence. I’m going to be honest. I think you have two viable options. Let’s name the other. There’s five total. I think these three are garbage. I think you have two, and I’m struggling to know what you should do, but it’s pretty obvious it’s one of these two and then I’ll pass it back. What do you think? What’s your gut? Because you know your business better, you know your customers better, you know whatever this space better than I do. I know the best practice is probably better than you do, and we’ll do that. I think a good mentor, advisor, or even friend, mastermind, whatever, couches things like that. They’re not so certain of everything, but then sometimes, sometimes it’s really, really obvious what you should do. It’s like, no, I’ve seen exactly this 10 times and 9 out of 10 times that this was the right, that type of thing. You can get to that point of certainty. That’s a huge win. These days. I try to think about how I make decisions. Well, A, I try not to make a ton of decisions all the time, and that might sound weird, but it’s like you have to make a lot fewer decisions than you think. The key phrase, have to. There are a lot of things you just don’t have to decide. I think in the early days of a startup, you have to make a lot of decisions quickly of, “What am I building? What are we doing? ICP, I got to move faster.” TinySeed was like that. MicroConf was like that. Drip was like that. But you get to a point where it’s like, “Oh no, we don’t need to decide about that. We’re just going to let it run. What’s working is working. We’re going to keep doing that.” That’s a skill. They often talk about retail investors, just consumers who day trade and they buy this stock and then they buy this index fund and they sell it because they read something in Bloomberg and then they do this and that. It’s flailing. It is tax disadvantaged. Almost no one does that. You have no advantage in that. I feel the same way about some founders who are like, “What’s working is right now for you, it’s like SEO and cold outreach or whatever it is, but it’s a grind.” No, shit. It’s always a grind. I don’t care if it’s a grind. Is it working? Yeah, yeah. We’re growing two grand MRR every month. Then why would you make any decision? Just keep doing it. It’s like I know that you want to day trade. You want to do something more exciting. The most exciting thing is new MRR.  Craig Hewitt:So I have two things around this because this is really hard. We are at the point in our business where it’s getting a little boring in a good way, to your point, and that the challenge, one, is you as a founder accepting that like, “Hey, just tune out all of that stuff and focus on the stuff that’s working.” You have to get over that. Then what I’ve found is you have to get over this next hump, which is you have to relate to your team that that’s how they need to think too. Because hopefully, your team is like, “Oh, hey, what if we do this? What if we build this feature? What if we support? What if we do this?” I think about this movie, the Yes Day, but in the movie they’re like, “I’m the fun guy, and you’re always the one that’s saying no,” the parents. I feel like the parent that always says no to the team because they’re like, “Hey, what if we do this? Hey, what if we do that?” I go, “No, what if we don’t do any of that stuff and just focus on this really narrow thing?” What you’re saying to the team is like, “Hey, we have to focus and prioritize.” If you do it wrong, which I think I might have at the beginning, what you say is let’s just dial back the intensity a little bit. That’s not exactly right, but it is, right? Because what you’re saying is we’re going to do less. We’re going to do it better and it’s going to be better for the company. It’s a very different mindset as a founder for sure. But even I think if you have entrepreneurial team members, they go, “Whoa, I only have to do this one thing. That’s crazy.” I have a little bit of insecurity around that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I could see that. I am guessing that’s where sprints were invented. We’re going to do a sprint. Whether it’s two weeks or three months, you hear marketing sprints are sometimes two or three months and development sprints are two weeks. Lock it in. Can’t change it, pretty much unless there’s a [inaudible 00:16:56].  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, put one the blinder.  Rob Walling:Yeah, because everyone has ideas and some of those ideas are good. There’s this Steve Jobs quote I mentioned offline, but I think that I quote him in my book, whatever. I don’t like it when people use Steve Jobs as an example, blah, blah, blah. He’s such an outlier. It’s like, “I’m going to use it to justify his really dumb thinking. Oh good.” But Steve Jobs says, “Focusing on stuff and building great things is not about the focus. It’s about saying no to hundreds of really good ideas.” I think about that quote so often of, “What is the one or two things that I should really be focusing on?” And then my next step if I’m going to do something in the business is how can I find someone who knows more about this than I do? So when we were going to start YouTube, we futzed around with it for a while, and I realized pretty quickly I have to be able to pay someone who just can get us there faster. We did. We hired a consultant and they were not cheap. They were several grand a month for advice, which I struggle with as a total cheap ass, a guy who grew up without money, but I’m like, “Dude, if I can grow this channel, it’s worth it.” It did, right? We’re at 80,000 subscribers or something. We grew very quickly, and there’s other stuff I’ve looked into. It’s like, “Oh, should we do TikTok? Should we do LinkedIn? Should we do whatever?” These are decisions I have to make, but I make them very slowly until I’m pretty damn sure that it’s the right one.” Then I’ll go deep and I’ll go really fast. I will spend a lot of money to have someone tell us exactly how to do it, maybe even to do it for us, depending on what it is that needs to be done. Then I will go all in. YouTube for us was I was shipping 52 videos a year at relatively high quality if you go watch them and 15 grand, 18 grand a month spent it on that, which is a lot. You might say, “Wow, that’s a lot of money.” It is a lot of money, but I deemed that I was either going to do it or I was not. What I wasn’t going to do was take that 18 grand, split it among, well, let’s try three or four things because guess what? Really low probability that any of them would’ve worked.  Craig Hewitt:It is what’s a good idea that you can execute on and that’s your skills, the people on your team, the people available is you, the money, all that stuff. This makes me think of is this book, Who Not How, and I’m blanking on the name.  Rob Walling:The author.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, but that’s it, right? It’s like when there’s a problem at a point when you have the resources, who can I hire to help me solve this or solve it for me? And then your goal is just to define what good is and let them go.  Rob Walling:Dan Sullivan.  Craig Hewitt:Dan Sullivan.  Rob Walling:Just looked it up.  Craig Hewitt:Amazing guy.  Rob Walling:You recommended that book to me a couple years ago and I got the Audible version of it.  Craig Hewitt:I think that one’s from Rubin.  Rob Walling:Is it? This is what happens.  Craig Hewitt:Rubin, the press, yeah.  Rob Walling:Rubin has the A method for hiring. That one came from Rubin. There’s a few. There’s a few of those. Yeah. So, it’s interesting. A, I make fewer decisions than most people these days. I used to make all the decisions. I’m going to do the stuff and flail around. It’s like that was something that as I matured, I realized, “Oh, that was not the right way to do it.” I should make fewer, more important, more focused decisions. As a result, my decisions are bigger and tend to have bigger consequences, I’ll say. Because when I committed to this money and this recording these videos, which is a lot chunk out of my week every week, and I wasn’t very good at it. It took me a long time when I started. So, I knew I was investing. But when I make those decisions, I think I mull it over for a few months usually if I have that luxury. Sometimes you don’t, but several weeks and then I start going to people. What do you think about this whole thing? We have this idea. So, Rubin, what do you think about that? Each of them has a different perspective. So, Sherry, what do you think about this? It’s like I get all these different inputs, mastermind, co-founder, whatever it is. I’m talking to a listener right now of how to make hard decisions. It’s like who do you have in your life? If you don’t have someone, then you might need to hire someone. Like you said, you have coaches. I have a therapist. I’ve been seeing a therapist for years on and off. There’s this stigma around it of like, “Well, you’re seeing a therapist, you must have (beep) wrong with you.” A, all of us have (beep) wrong with us, so please don’t kid yourself to think otherwise. For me, it’s self-reflection. She’ll tell me, “Here’s what I’m hearing you say.” I’m like, “Huh, why did I say that?” She’s like, “I don’t know. Let’s figure out why you said that. You obviously are programmed to have this limiting belief maybe.” So sometimes I’ll talk stuff through with her as well. I wouldn’t talk through a YouTube launch, but I would talk through a hard decision that I think has a mental component. Sometimes you know what’s the right decision? But you can’t do it. You won’t do it and you’re avoiding it because it’s making you uncomfortable. That’s when I’m like, “I need to talk through why I’m uncomfortable and figure out-”  Craig Hewitt:This is okay.  Rob Walling:Is it because the way I was brought up as a kid? Is it because I didn’t have money in my 20s and I’m scared of always going back to that or whatever? Are those the reasons? We’ve talked a lot about decision-making in professional context, which I think is helpful. I know people often like to hear, especially the folks who listen to this podcast that are further along where it’s like, “Oh, I’m doing a million a year, five million a year.” This type of stuff, we all struggle with it, but let’s talk about the work-life piece. In terms of family time, we both have families. When my kids were younger, I definitely struggled. My kids are older now. They’re almost 14 and 18. So, they’re self-sufficient. It’s having a roommate rather than a kid. You know what I mean? They put themselves to bed at the time that they should go to bed and they wake up in the morning. If I make breakfast, they eat it. Otherwise, they make it for themselves. So, it’s different with younger kids. That’s one thing I will say is if you have young kids now, realize it won’t be there forever. They will get older and you will be able to leave them alone overnight for multiple days at a certain point. It’s mind-blowing when I say that, right, but we haven’t hired a babysitter in years because it just changes. You can, right? But it’s like realize that this time is only a few years, however that few is. So, with that caveat, I will say that much like making fewer decisions and focusing in my professional life, when I’m with my family, well, A, I try to have really interactive, meaningful time with them where it’s like, “Dude, let’s play a game together.” My 17-year-old, he’s almost 18, is home from college for summer. I’m like, “I’m off calls at 3:00 today. You and I are walking somewhere.” We’ll go on a walk for an hour, 90 minutes. We’ll go somewhere. We’ll get ice cream. It’s a great day here in Minneapolis. I’m just very deliberate about that. We don’t need five hours together tonight. That one hour, we will have so much conversation about so many things about our lives, about what I’m thinking about. He asks me about work. What’s going on with this and are you stressed about that?  Craig Hewitt:That’s cool.  Rob Walling:You know what I mean? It’s not all perfect. It’s not all amazing and it’s harder. If my kids were two and four, it would be a different story. Both of us can weigh in on there because we’ve been there. But I think that’s been my realization is it’s similar of if I’m going to spend time with them, focus it in a way that is very meaningful. We watch movies or watch YouTube or play games or do other stuff. I’m not saying it’s all just this intense conversation, but if I start feeling myself distracted or not wanting to be there, then I’m like, “Okay, check yourself. Should you just switch to something else and come back to this? Come hang out with the kid in an hour when you really are able to focus on them, or do you have something going on that you need to deal with?” So how do you think about this? You have younger kids.  Craig Hewitt:So I have 11 and 13-year-olds, and they’re getting to this point. We haven’t hired a babysitter in a while, but they can’t stay by themselves overnight. A couple hours, we can go to a dinner or a movie or something. Absolutely. The biggest improvement for me has been this intentionality and separation of there’s work time and then there’s just hanging out together time unstructured. There’s me being more intentional like, “Hey, let’s go play basketball” with my son, or hey, let’s go walk the dog after dinner with my daughter or something. To boot, my wife started working again about four months ago for the first time in 13 years since our daughter was born. That’s an understatement. That’s been a really big change in our life and family dynamic is wow, for several days a week now, she’s just gone and I’m the only one. I’m working and responsible for the kids. So, I’ve just had a lot more this is it. At 3:00, I’m at least flexible because the thing is the kids come home and they’re fried because they’ve been at school for six or seven hours. They just want to hang out and play Fortnite or whatever. So, I will mix that time is I’ll just grab my laptop and go downstairs and sit on the couch and futz around. But what that means is the really super important (beep) has to get done in the beginning of the day because I know I got to create this proposal, I got to follow up on this email. That’s just leisure, work time. So, that’s how I overlapped the two. Then at 4:00 or 4:00, cool, done, put the computer away. The computer comes back to the office. So, it’s not physically in the space where we are as a family and then we do stuff. We’ve started cooking together a lot more. That’s a really cool thing. Then yeah, same here, we have a garden and my son is in charge of getting the salad every night from the garden. So, there’s just little stuff like that. Empowering them with chores and activities that we can do together are really cool. So, as much as you can extrapolate that out, I think, into your life, it’s positive.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s really good. Those kids will remember that for probably the rest of their life. Not every moment, but they will remember, “Oh, I remember getting stuff from the garden.” If they do it 20, 50 times, whatever, it’ll just all be an amalgam of a single memory. But for sure, I have a bunch of stuff like that from my childhood. I don’t want to paint this as like, “Oh, if you have a two and a four-year-old or four kids under eight or whatever-”  Craig Hewitt:You’re screwed.  Rob Walling:It is just a lot more challenging, but it’s even more reason to focus relentlessly and try to figure out the right things to work on. In a business, to me, it’s this dichotomy of risk versus certainty. It’s like what’s the riskiest part of the business that needs founder-level thinking? That’s what I’m focused on. Anything that has certainty in a SaaS company, it’s like if you’re two years into a SaaS, you know that someone can answer support requests. There’s an SOP and most of them can be answered. There’s a knowledge base, whatever. Frankly, writing code, I know it’s a craft. I loved writing code and I was a craft person when I did it, but someone else can build that feature, but most other people can’t design that feature. That’s the thing. Designing it or crafting it or saying exactly how it should operate, product-level work is quite hard to find because your knowledge of your customer need there is founder-level need until you can hire. I mean the first product person we hired, we were doing several million in ARR, and his salary was $165,000. I mean it was really expensive. He makes more than that now. It’s like that’s the level of product person who can take stuff off your plate who’s been doing it, but there are always elements of risk and always elements of certainty in a business. I think that the certainty is that’s where your comfort zone is. So, unprodded you will slide into the comfort zone because it’s like, “Oh look at so much work I’m getting done” and then you work 12 hours on something that really should have either not gotten done or should have been delegated to someone else.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, I mean the rule of thumb I use there is… This comes from my coach, Mike Del Ponte is like, “Do the work that’s as close to the customer as you can.” Typically, that’s sales that. That’s the best, right? It’s like, “Can I go talk to this person and sell them a thing?” After that, I agree. It’s probably either marketing or UX product design because that’s more of a one-to-many. Then the things that are way down on the scale are like, “How do I grow my falling on Twitter?” Even should I start a podcast? I don’t know, maybe, but only if you think there’s real potential direct impact. I think a lot of the time that we waste as founders are on brand marketing. If you’re at a few million, maybe you can allocate 20% of your marketing budget to brand marketing, but until then you got to be hand-to-hand.  Rob Walling:Yeah, yeah. You’re not a media company, right? That’s not what we are as bootstrap SaaS companies and thinking you can do that quickly and it won’t be a waste of time. It’s pretty rough. Same thing with, “Oh, you should build an audience in order to build your…” Oh, that’s a real long way to do it. I built an audience. I built multiple audiences over several years and it’s 15 years or whatever. It’s way more time than sales you will make if it’s for SaaS, but if you want to sell info products or courses, that’s another thing.  Craig Hewitt:I say it for all the people who are yelling at their phones right now, I say that because we made that mistake. We thought, “Hey, we’ll do a bunch of brand marketing and it’ll really result in a lot.” It didn’t. Now we’re much more one-to-one and we’re growing faster than we were when we were a team of 15.  Rob Walling:So let’s switch it up. This is a great topic and I didn’t want to cut it short because I think there’s a lot to be said about it, but we did have other folks weighing on Twitter about stuff, and I want to get to their questions. Christopher Gimmer asked, “I’d like to hear Craig talk a bit more about the coaching he’s doing, the pros and cons of it. When he felt confident enough to start offering it, would he recommend other founders do it on the side? Does it attract from the main business, et cetera?”  Craig Hewitt:That’s like four questions.  Rob Walling:It is.  Craig Hewitt:How did it come about? A bit of the focus that we talked about is we had just said no to a whole lot of things and I found myself with a little bit of time. I didn’t have that thing where I said, “Ooh, if I had 10 more, I could spend these 10 hours in the week to do something and it would move the needle.” So I said, “Well, I can spend these 10 hours in the week doing this other thing that I really enjoy. I’m pretty uniquely qualified to do and it would be helpful and I can make a little bit of money.” So that’s how it came about, and it was just very, very, very slow. I think I wrote a LinkedIn and a Twitter post about it maybe. I sent an email to the 200 people on my newsletter about it and got a couple of clients, got a couple of referrals from that. So, at this point, have a handful of folks that I’m coaching and it is the ICP’s founders, typically SaaS founders who are looking for help growing their business, so sales and marketing. We work together every other week for an hour and I want them to come with the biggest challenges they’re having. That can be anywhere from review my cold email sequence to how do I think about managing this sales rep to here’s my org chart, where do you see the holes to I helped someone go through an acquisition where they were acqui-hired. That was super cool. So, I mean, all the (beep) that I did, that you and I’ve done is I’ve done this for folks who are looking to do it, just like we talked about before. It’s like, “How can I pay a little bit of money or how can they pay a little bit of money to get a few years ahead?” Is it a distraction? Actually, I think I’m a much better founder now because of doing this, because part of it is I see a lot more, right? I see in the market how people are doing things, and so you have a lot of visibility through TinySeed of all the companies. I have a much smaller percentage of that, but also, I got to walk the walk when I am talking to a founder and they’re like, “Oh, I was thinking about doing this and I’m thinking about doing that. I’m thinking about doing the other.” I go, “Do the thing that’s as close to the customer as you can,” and then I hang up the phone and I go futz off to do some SEO thing. I’m like, “Whoa, Jack, that is not what you just said. So, you got to walk the walk.” So yeah, I think it’s not that much time. It’s definitely not that much mental overhead or stress because it’s just a call and I really, really, really like it. So, there’s that. It’s like sometimes you got to just eat the ice cream and that’s a bit of what it is.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I would guess for some founders, it would be a distraction if they were in super grind 10 hour, 12 hours a day, all consumed with their business and they’ve never done coaching, because just because you can do something doesn’t mean you can coach other people on it. I’ve seen some coaches who are so sure of their point of view because they had a success or whatever, and they’re like, “No, everyone should do it.” So then every call, it’s like, “No, you should do this. You should do that.” It’s like that’s not coaching. Coaching is more asking questions and figuring out, “Hey, what is really the best option?” Usually, there is no one best option. There’s a couple options that are viable based on criteria, but I do think that you were in a spot, you are in a spot with Castos where you’re five years, six years in, seven years, depending on how far.  Craig Hewitt:Seven. Yeah.  Rob Walling:At a certain point, as the business matures, it does require I think less. If you’re doing it well, you are delegating and it requires less and less. Even if it requires eight hours a day from you still, less and less founder cycles because it comes back to risk versus certainty is how much risk is left. There’s a few areas of risk, meaning uncertainty, or just founder level thinking, but you’re not making the same number of decisions on a day-to-day basis now than you were four years ago, five years ago, right? It’s that good glucose, as Dan Andrews says, to be able to coach, because I tell you what, coaching is… I don’t know if you find it this way. It’s very tiring. I say that in a good way, but it grinds me down in terms of you’re going to present me… The only problems I get, because I obviously do this through TinySeed. The only problems I get are ones that talented, gifted, handpick founders don’t know the answer to. So, it’s all the hardest problems. I consider that an honor and an amazing thing, but damn if it does, it just burn through my brain cells because I’m like, “All right, tell me again and let’s get it all in.” Then I’m like, “Oh, this is hard and it matters.” So I’m not going to half ask this decision, so let’s dive in. I’m taking notes, I’m thinking through. It’s like whiteboarding a new feature where you’re going deep and you have a mental model in your head of ba, ba, ba, right? So for me, coaching is exhilarating. It keeps me in the game, exactly what you’re saying. I have 192 companies and I’m like four, five, six, seven conversations a week depending. But those ones I end and I’m like, “I need to go for a walk because I’ve just expelled a lot of good…” Talk about decision making fatigue almost. It’s like I’m in that helping them make hopefully the best decision. So, that comes back to if I was 8 to 10 hours a day on a startup and I didn’t have that energy to do it, I wouldn’t coach, but again, I feel like you’re in a pretty good spot where you were ready for it and you’re highly gifted at it as well.  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, it’s interesting. I don’t find it draining at all, which is a really good sign. I think I did a bit of it for free and found I really liked it. I learned a ton about this whole giving advice versus asking questions. I’m like way, way better coach now than I was at the beginning, but yeah, it’s exhilarating in a very healthy, appropriate way. So, to me, that’s a really good sign that it’s probably a pretty good place for me.  Rob Walling:Sounds like it. Yeah. Our last question from Twitter comes from Matt Paulson, longtime listener of the show, and I presume of Rogue Startups as well because he says, “The thing that the two of you have in common is you both used to have podcast co-hosts and now you don’t.” I think the implied question there is maybe what was that experience like? I don’t know you need to say better or worse with a co-host or without, but is that maybe hard? Was that a learning curve? What was it like for you to transition?  Craig Hewitt:Yeah, so just for context, I have a podcast called Rogue Startups where started as just me, and it was an interview-based show. My third guest I think was Dave Rodenbaugh, who then became my co-host for the next 290 episodes, for the most part, over six or seven years. I mean, we’re a very long time into it. I just published episode 314 this week. Yeah. So, Dave and I largely had just a co-host show where we just provide updates on what’s going on, a lot like you and Mike did, sometimes interviews, all this stuff. Then really through COVID, it was really hard for everybody. A little bit after, Dave was like, “Man, I don’t care to continue anymore,” is I think what he would say. To me, maybe to you, this is super important to me. If you want to use the term brand, it is probably my biggest aspect of my personal brand, which has some importance. So, I was like, “Cool, man, I want to continue. Are you okay with that?” He said, “Yeah, this is just not for me, so not for me anymore.” So that’s the context. Yeah, it was super hard. It was super hard. In a way, I was really excited because I was like, “Cool, I get to continue doing this thing that I really like that has been the catalyst for a lot of my business stuff.” But then I was like, “Whoa, when you have a co-host, it is that mirror of energy a lot,” right? Hey, let’s just hop on. I don’t have a lot to talk about, but (beep) Dave just did this thing. Cool. That’s the episode for the week. Now, I don’t know what to do. I got to find a guest, I got to find an interesting guest. Because the last thing I want is to get whoever to come on and talk about SEO again. I always say when we’re advising our customers at Castos, like you got to find the person, you got to find Rob Walling, who everyone has heard on podcasts to talk about something you’ve never heard him talk about, which is pretty challenging. Or you got to find the person who no one has ever heard about that’s going to blow their mind. That’s slightly easier, but still pretty challenging. Both those things just require a lot of effort. So, I’m fortunate to be networked pretty well in the entrepreneur podcast community, have probably taken a lot of similar steps to you of don’t have as many guests as rotating co-hosts. Then I get the most good feedback from my solo episodes. So, aside from my episode with Jason Cohen that went out two weeks ago, I only get positive responses to my solo episodes, but they are soul sucking and I can only manage about one a month. So, having a co-host to your podcast is by far the easiest way to have a podcast. Not doing it is really hard, but I’m glad the podcast is continuing on. I guess that’s the short version.  Rob Walling:I think I feel the same way. I agree fully with you that having someone else on the mic is you can show up with almost nothing to talk about and fill time with pretty intelligent and entertaining things. Doing that solo, like you said, if you don’t plan for it, you’re on your own and what are you doing then? You are either answering questions or you’re just coming up with a topic and then talking to nothing for 20 minutes or 30 minutes or whatever. You’re right, those were really hard for me. They’re less hard now. Now, I have more confidence in my voice or there’s just something that shifted where I was like, “Okay, I am just going to say…” I used to filter a lot more if I’m honest. I was like, “Oh, what if I have shown my real personality?” or “Maybe I shouldn’t be so opinionated, but maybe this will make someone mad.” I’m not going out with super scathing hot takes or anything, but you might notice that over the past, probably four years, five years since I went solo, I have just become more opinionated about certain things, about certain anti patterns and certain success patterns that I see over and over. That makes it almost easier because I don’t have to censor myself as much on the solo episodes where I used to start, I would say a whole paragraph. Then I’m like, “Oh, what if that makes someone feel bad? Editor, just cut that whole thing.” So it was just a start, stop, start, stop. It wasn’t that fun. I was always worried, “What am I going to talk about? What topic can I possibly talk about?” Now I have this huge Trello board because stuff just hits me. As I consume things, I listen to audiobooks. I hear other podcasts like yours and the other ones I listen to. Oftentimes it’s something completely outside of startups like the Comic Lab Podcast where it’s these two artists that are independent comic guys and they publish their own books, not through publishers. They do Kickstarters and Patreons and all that. They’ll say something and I’m like, “Oh, that totally applies to startups, and I’ve never heard-”  Craig Hewitt:Oh, that’s cool.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I’ve had three of those probably in the past six months where I brought it on the show. Then there’s even Dungeons and Dragons podcasts or metaphors with games or something. I’m like, “Oh yeah, that is a thing.” The thing I’ve really enjoyed about it, I think, is I definitely wanted to experiment with a lot of formats and just experiment with things. I mean, if you’ve listened to this show for any length of time, you’ve heard me bring in Beatles music and I forget who else I brought on, but different. I’ll talk about a song and then I’ll bring the song on. It’s super cool when you listen to it, but it’s a weird thing to do on a startup podcast for the first time. It was something when I had a co-host, I was like, “Oh, do I check with him? Is it weird to do a solo episode if I have a co-host? Is that pulling the spotlight?” There was all this stuff that I was concerned about experimenting with, and I think that was maybe to the detriment of the variety of the show. Because after Mike stepped back, I tried a lot of stuff and actually a bunch of formats that I don’t do anymore, but I tried them. They were forgettable, the formats. People just weren’t that interested. The ones that stick are the ones that people comment on and they say, “Oh, I really like that.” Similarly, the solo episodes always resonate. It resonates with somebody.  Craig Hewitt:If I could, I think the thing that brings this full circle to business is nothing’s forever. You won’t do this podcast forever probably, or you won’t be the host of this podcast forever. I don’t know. Maybe I’ll run Castos forever, I don’t know, but you won’t be at your job forever. You won’t have the same co-founder forever. Maybe you’ll stay married forever. That’s cool. I hope I do, but I think to go into most of these things expecting it to be forever is setting yourself up for disappointment. Going into it a little eyes wide open and setting expectations with a co-host or with a co-founder, you talk about, “Hey, if you go into a co-founder agreement, have (beep) in writing.” Maybe with a podcast co-host, it doesn’t need to be a legal document, but an email to say, “Hey, this is it. We’re going to check in once a quarter. If anybody wants out, that’s cool. This is the process.” I didn’t have that because Dave and I just started podcasting and backed our way into a partnership. If I did it again, I would be a little more intentional to say, “This is the situation now. It probably will change, and these are the parameters around how it can change.” Just there’s no hard feelings and there weren’t with Dave and I. I don’t think there were with you and Mike. It was just the right time to start doing something different, but it doesn’t always work out that way.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that. Nothing is forever. Everybody sells eventually. Everybody sells eventually. Never thought Mailchimp would sell. You’re right, podcasts either fade or they change, different co-hosts. Like Calacanis on This Week in Startups had Molly Wood as a co-host. Then Molly Wood disappeared and there was never anything mentioned about… I mean, I shouldn’t say she disappeared. She stopped being co-host suddenly, and there was never a conversation about it. Now I think he has a new co-host, but that’s a thing, but what is he, like 1,200 episodes in or 1,300? I don’t know. He’s a lot of episodes and it’s like that’s just how things happen when you do them for 14 years. They do change, and this podcast is episode 700, whatever, 19. It’s 14 years, about 14 years in, similarly. So, just expect that you roll with it or you quit at some point, and that’s okay. There’s a pretty good book called Quit. What’s her name? She’s the poker player, Annie Duke. It just came out. I will admit, I could summarize the book in about a three-minute Loom. There were some key takeaways that I thought these were really good, and there was a lot of stuff that I was just like, “Eh.” But if you can read a summary or listen to the audiobook or whatever, it’s interesting and not a justification, but a defense of like, “Hey, sometimes you should quit.” There are times when you should stop doing things, and it’s a good reminder because society somehow has this big stigma around it, but I know some people where them quitting either a business or a relationship or some other effort they’ve done for a long time was actually the kickstart of a whole new chapter in their life. So, it’s always something to keep in mind. Craig Hewitt, thanks so much for joining me, man. You are @TheCraigHewitt on Twitter and craighewitt.me if folks want to check out your email newsletter.

That really, even if you’re a horizontal product, you still have to make some difficult decisions about who your someones are going to be. Who are you going to have everything for? Because even if you have a horizontal product, there are going to be different use cases and you are going to have to make hard decisions with incomplete information as the founder, or as the product leader, about what to build and what to say no to. You’re listening to Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m your host, Rob Walling. Today, I’m going to be covering some solo topics. There’s a listener question or two thrown in here, but they are questions that I think apply to a Rob solo adventure. The first topic I’d like to cover today is about testing pricing for your product. This came about when I asked Twitter for questions when Derrick Reimer was going to be on the show and we got more questions than we had time to cover. This question was an overflow that I saved in a questions Trello board. It’s from Kat at buildthekeyword.com. She asks, “How do you test different prices for your product?” The answer is there are several different ways to do this. Testing pricing is hard, but the thing to think about is there’s testing pricing for brand new customers who are coming to your website, or doing a demo or sales call. And then, there is changing pricing on existing customers. Notifying them, “You’re currently paying $50. It’s going up to 100,” or 75. Separate those two things in your mind. Because what you don’t want to do is change and test prices on existing customers without being really confident that those price changes are in order. Usually, you test it on new folks coming in. I have only known of one SaaS company that ever test prices. Everyone else just does not have the volume, and frankly it is so much work to do this well. It’s truly just split testing. Having people click and the price appeared differently, the standard split test definition that we talk about. It’s not something that I see almost anyone doing. Usually, the way that you test pricing if you have a low touch funnel is you go to your pricing page and you just change the pricing on it. You see how it impacts your conversion rate over the next week or month. I’ve called this a poor person’s split test before, which is it’s not ideal, it’s not scientific. But if you have a real pulse on your business, and you have a decent flow of traffic, and prospects, and people coming across your pricing page frankly, then you can see patterns. When I used to test pricing, it was only when I had a lot of folks hitting that pricing page. Because if it’s a trickle, you can’t see the difference. There’s too much noise. Usually, most people don’t look at changing their pricing as a test. They often say, “I’m going all-in and I’m just going to change my pricing. I think I’m priced too low or I think the value metric is off.” They go to the pricing page in the Stripe call, and they just change it. I’ll say hope for the best, but really it’s a calculated risk. It’s a calculated gamble of odds are pretty good I’m under-priced, I feel like I’m under-priced. I am going to solve that by raising all of my tiers. Or by, let’s say, dropping my lowest tier is something people frequently do. Obviously, I’ve seen several TinySeed founders do that. And then, trying to make it work. There were times, when I’ve raised prices, where I was just like, “I’m committed to making this price point work.” It’s called aspirational pricing. I aspire for my product to be worth this much, this is the business I want to build, it has this pricing. Therefore, I’m going to keep building features to where this price is a no-brainer. You can say, “I want my price points to be $1000, that’s the minimum.” It’s like yeah, it’ll take you years to get there, or you’re just in the wrong category to have that kind of price point. There’s all kinds of ways I can poke holes in what I just said. But for me, it worked. It allowed me to build a great business. If you are demos, and it’s one-call closes, or it’s procurement, or whatever, and it’s a high touch sales environment, you can just unpublish your pricing from your website. You can either say, “Starts at 499 a month. Starts at $1000 a month,” whatever it is. Or you can list some pricing and call us, or you can just not list pricing at all. Have a pricing page. When they click through say, “Hey, click here to talk to our demo team.” You could say our sales team. You could say, “Click here to talk to the founder to learn more about how we structure the product and how this works.” Then you split test it a bit, and you start quoting prices that are higher than what you’re currently changing, basically. You see the reaction. You see if folks choke, or you see if folks … Usually, what you’ll do is you’ll double your price and someone will say, “Oh, yeah. Great,” and they still sign up. Then you’ll double it again, and maybe get some pushback from a few but you realize, “Oh, I can still close some deals. This is how I think of testing pricing. Notice I haven’t said test price drops. That does happen, it’s just very, very infrequent. Usually if you’re testing, you are trying to test the price elasticity of your space and of the folks who visit your website. Or the folks who are raising their hands and becoming leads for you. It is an inexact science. It just always is. So is attribution. When people are clicking through and converting, where did all these leads come from? You can’t attribute 100%. Can you attribute 60 or 70 percent? Yeah, probably. Is that good enough, is that the best you can do? It probably is. It’s the same with any hard decision where you have incomplete information. You do the best that you can. Part of it is some founder gut. You collect what data you can, and you make observations, and then you make a bit of a gut decision about, “Should I continue with this price increase, or is it not working? Have I killed the business?” Not even killed the business, have I slowed the growth? It’s not just testing pricing. It could be I’m going to add a credit card before free trial. I’m going to remove the credit card before a free trial. I want to try freemium. I want to discontinue freemium. I want to keep the pricing the same, but I just want to change the structure. I want to change the value metrics. So my tiers are still 50, 100, 200, but maybe I don’t price based on storage, now it’s priced on emails sent, or whatever. There’s a bunch of different things you can do here. Before I did these, I would always have a conversation, well A, with myself. But B, with a couple other trusted folks that I had. Is this a co-founder? Is this an advisor? Is this someone in my mastermind? Is it a mentor, if you’re in a program like TinySeed. I would get the best advice that I knew how to get. I would factor that in with my own gut feeling, and then I would test. For me, most of the time, I was dealing with low, medium touch funnel so I could test on the website and we also had a lot of traffic. It allowed me to quickly … I wasn’t split testing, keep in mind. But I knew historically, in any given week, how many new trials we got. And in any given week, how many new conversions we had. I could see, within a week, I was like, “Okay, we’re still on track but our pricing has increased from there.” Or, “We’re ahead of track.” You could get a gauge for it early. It wasn’t definitive, but it made me feel more comfortable with it. Testing pricing is hard, it really is. But I would actually say you have an advantage if you are doing high touch, if you’re doing demos, and that allows you to have conversations with people. It allows you, you double the price, you quote it to them and they say, “Wow, that’s out of our budget.” You say, “Oh, what is the budget? What is your budget?” Or, “We can work with you. For example, if you want to pay annually, I can knock 20% off of that.” I’m not saying sell from your heels. I’m not saying you just back off instantly. But when you are increasing prices, there are ways to back off that increase in realtime on a sales call if you realize that you have potentially over-quoted for this particular prospect. Thanks for that question, Kat. I hope it was helpful. My next topic is about one-time payments, especially folks talking about them on Twitter. It is usually indie hacker founders, who are now doing, I don’t know if they’re following in the Basecamp steps of doing once. They’re doing lifetime deals on SaaS, which doesn’t quite … Who was it, Ahnar and I were talking on this show? It might have been Derrick. Where I said if you collect one-time lifetime payments for a SaaS, but you now need to keep that SaaS running for years, and years, and years, is it a little bit, I don’t want to say Ponzi scheme, I know you’re not doing that intentionally. Basically, if you don’t sell additional lifetimes a year from now, you will be paying server costs, hosting costs, whatever, all the other costs, storage costs, whatever else is there. Even maintenance cost, unless you’re doing everything yourself. You are taking that out of one-time earnings that you got 12-months ago. It’s just an odd model. One time software makes sense if you download it and install it, and there is “no maintenance.” I don’t need to do bug fixes, I don’t need to maintain server infrastructure, and all that. That’s one my struggles with it. My other struggle is I almost feel like people don’t understand how different one-time revenue is from recurring revenue. Monthly recurring revenue is the golden standard. This is the cheat code of every other business, where they want to get paid monthly on a predictable schedule. SaaS has that cheat code built in by default. You’ve heard me talk about the cheat codes of SaaS being net negative churn and a handful of others. But even annual revenue, when it’s recurring, can be tricky. It can seem … I’m going to give you an example. We’ll get folks who apply for TinySeed. You’ll see their revenue over the past six months, we ask for MRR. You’ll see it going up. It’ll be six months ago, it was 1000. Then it was 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000. We’re like, “Well, this is an interesting early stage business.” For a business to be growing that quickly over that short a period of time, obviously depending on their customer count and all this, they have some product market fit. Someone is wanting to buy this, they’re sticking around. There’s growth, they know how to market. There’s signals there. It’s early, but you see it. Then we’ll get on a call with them and we’ll realize they are collecting annual payments. All those numbers have to be divided by 12. Because it’s actually $6000 of ARR, of annual recurring revenue they collected. Which, divided by 12, is only $500 a month of MRR. Really quickly, we can have a $6000 MRR business, that appeared to be that way but wasn’t actually, suddenly become a $500 MRR business. Which frankly, is at the bottom, bottom end of the threshold at which we would even consider funding a company. So it went from this amazing business to oh this is, I won’t say unfundable, but as a general rule, we don’t fund companies with MRR that low. That’s just going from monthly to annual. One-time is another order of magnitude removed from this. To where, this is the old days, where I started the first of every month with DotNetInvoice, which was $300 downloadable software. First of every month, $0 in revenue. It was such an uphill battle to grow that business. It was a step one business, there was a bunch of things around it so I’m not trying to extrapolate my experience with that one thing. But once I went to recurring, I swear, I will never go back. Recurring revenue is where it’s at. Whether you’re doing annual … I’m not saying monthly is better than annual or anything like that. I really want to caution you against getting caught up in what feels like zigging when everyone else is zagging, but just doing it for the sake of being a contrarian. It feels like this willful belief in something that … As I’m saying annual and recurring, and doing the math, and then saying one-time is just so, so much less valuable than that, there are folks on Twitter in the indie hacker community who are posting these one-time things and acting like it’s a big deal. It’s something, but you’re selling a lifetime whatever for $50. You’re just competing on price at that point. I guess that’s good, to get your brand out there. There are pros and cons to this. But this is not the kind of business you should aspire to. If you’re listening to this podcast and you view it as a step in the direction of trying to get your name out, great. Be really aware what you’re getting into if you’re going to be charging lifetime or one-time deals. It’s not a never from me, but it’s a be very, very cautious of how you think about that revenue. As Ruben Gomez says, he did an App Sumo deal. He views those users, he got paid once, and he made I forget what the number is, 33,000 or something from it. App Sumo takes the lion’s share, they take 70 or 80 percent, I believe. He views them as freemium users. He says, “They don’t even think of them as paid users.” That’s how you need to think about it. They are free users that you happened to get a check at one point to maybe help you develop, to maybe help you build. I think that’s a much more healthy way to do it. Personally, I can’t imagine ever doing lifetime deals, actually. Then those customers, if you go to try to sell this app, now they are a liability because you have to service them and there is no ongoing revenue. There are some problems with it. It’s not a never do, but it’s a highly discouraged. If a TinySeed company came to me and said they were going to do a lifetime deal, it’s like forking your code base, it’s like translating it into other languages, it’s like launching a second product. I would be pretty hard against it, unless they convinced me that they have thought through all of the ramifications, both positive and negative, and they could convince me why it’s the right choice. We’ve been partnering with Lemon.io for several years.

That’s lemon.io/startups. My next topic is one from Des Traynor. I saw a tweet from him. He’s the co-founder of Intercom, which I believe is a unicorn company out there with a few billion. He spoke at MicroConf several years back, he’s a good dude. I invited him actually to speak at a recent MicroConf, but he’s busy. He said he has a hard time getting out and about, and speaking at events. But he tweeted, “Having something for everyone gets you acquisition. Having everything for someone gets you retention. Choose wisely.” What an insightful tweet. I respect Des a lot as a product thinker. If you’ve heard any of his conference talks frankly, he’s done talks at YC, he’s done talks at MicroConf. Search him up on YouTube. His thinking, for me, it always lines up with a lot of the things I’m thinking, but it takes them to the next level. He says things that, once he says them, I’m like, “Oh my gosh, that’s brilliant. Oh my gosh, that’s obvious.” But it wasn’t obvious before he said it. That’s the best type of philosophy or thinking that I like, which is something that makes me realize something new, it educates me, but it feels very also intuitive at the same time. I love this idea. “Having something for everyone gets you acquisition. Having everything for someone gets you retention.” And, “Choose wisely,” he’s implying you have to choose between those. Because in a perfect world, wouldn’t we have a bunch of stuff for everyone so that we could acquire new customers? And then, we could have everything for just one or two of those ICPs. But what he’s saying is then you lose the others, they all churn out. This is in line with that thinking. That really, even if you’re a horizontal product, you still have to make some difficult decisions about who your someones are going to be. Who are you going to have everything for? Because even if you have a horizontal product, there are going to be different use cases, and you are going to have to make hard decisions with incomplete information, as the founder or as the product leader, about what to build and what to say no to. This is where realizing who your ideal customers are, who are your best customers, who are the ones who are least price sensitive, who are the ones that get the most value out of your product that churn that least. That are, I don’t know, the best to work with, and that just love it, and stick around. And they tell their friends. They do all these things that help push the business forward. Those are the folks that you try to build everything for. It can often to be hard to find those people, or to know what their commonalities are. It might be as simple for you as it was when I built my last startup, Drip. Originally I was like, “Well it’s going to be SaaS founders, and bloggers are using it, and WordPress plugin developers.” There might have been one other, but I think those were the first three. What I realized quickly was WordPress plugin developers were not actually a great audience for it. There’s a bunch of reasons for it. But it became obvious that really, SaaS founders, because there wasn’t a great ESP for SaaS at the time, and then bloggers because they were trying to move automations, move up from MailChimp or move down from Infusionsoft. Then what we realized is we actually were naturally, organically acquiring ecommerce customers. 15% of our customer base was eComm and we had never marketed to eComm. It was surprising to me when we found that out. I didn’t know. We had a few thousand customers. We had a virtual assistant. This is before AI, I’d have AI do this now. But we had a virtual assistant go through and categorize a big sampling of them. It turns out that it was surprising to me that so many eComm folks were using it. There was later a pivot to focus on eComm after I left, or as I was transitioning out. Now, it’s been a pivot back to where it’s more of a general email marketing tool and not going specifically after eComm. But those realizations … Drip is a horizontal play. It is an ESP. It could be used by anyone. We had realtors using it. We had folks building custom, bespoke tailor in London. We had podcasters, we had all this stuff. We had internet marketers, info marketers, course makers, all this stuff. That was actually the third, I was grouping bloggers with course folks. I think today they’re called makers or creators, but that term wasn’t really around back then. What that made us realize though, is I could bucket the feature requests into, “Oh, they’re SaaS, so they’re going to want this. I want to build some stuff for SaaS.” We did realize that SaaS wanted to go down a path that was really complicated. At a certain point, we backed of it, I’ll say. Folks like Customer.io and Userlist have done a much better job of catering to SaaS. But the bloggers, the course creators and eComm were folks that we were taking comments, thoughts, and really trying to serve. Now what we also realized was that bloggers were high churn. Bloggers really hopped around. They would quickly switch. Or they would stop blogging, that’s what we saw a lot. They were very price sensitive, actually. It became this interesting balance of you can have a few ICPs, especially if you have a larger team. But you can’t have 20. You would need separate products if you were going to do that. You would need a lot of folks working. Can you imagine, one code base that catered towards 20 different ideal customer profiles? It’d be a mess. That’s what I like about what Des is saying here. It’s, “Having something for everyone gets you acquisition. Having everything for someone gets you retention.” That idea of having everything for one ICP in the early days, and then two, and then three. Maybe you never even get to three, maybe you do only have a specific vertical where you’re targeting HR representatives that work for construction firms, for example. And that is your vertical, then maybe you really do have one ICP. That makes it even easier. Then you build everything for that someone. At a certain point, you tap out your total reachable market. Then, you get to decide do I build a second product for this same ICP? Or do I expand into an adjacent vertical? Do I move to be more horizontal? Do I raise prices? Whatever else, you figure out how to get past that plateau. But having something for everyone, a little bit for everyone, it can get people in the door. But does it create the longterm retention, and net negative churn, and expansion revenue, loyal customers, retention, all that? It’s hard to do that. You have to build a product that your ideal customers love and need, and solves a desperate pain point. Desperate enough that they are willing to stick around through the ups and the downs. It’s easier said than done. But that’s why I liked Des’ relatively succinct yet elegant statement of choosing wisely, which you focus on. The last topic is on recommending things to other people. This is a person-to-person recommendation thing I’m thinking about. As an example, when I recommend a biography to someone I will say, “Even if you don’t know this person or know their story, it’s a really good story.” This is Phil Knight with Shoe Dog. I don’t really care about the advent of Nike and the start of the company. In fact, I didn’t even wear Nikes when I was a runner, I love ASICS. The idea of Nike was just, “Okay, is this going to be interesting?” It is so well written. If you’re listening to this and you haven’t read or listened to Shoe Dog, I recommend it. It’s an incredible story. One of the best parts is that it ends right at the startup story because it ends, I believe, right before they go public. It’s like once they go public, I don’t really care. I don’t want to hear the trials and tribulations of being a big company, it’s not something that interests me. That’s one of those books where I’m pretty opinionated. Even if you don’t know the person, it’s good. Versus the Sid Meier autobiography. If you don’t know who Sid Meier is, you don’t know the games he made, it’s fine. But it’s really cool if you know Civilization. His book is called Sid Meier: A Memoir, or something like that. If you know some of the games he created and you hear him, the touchpoints are really interesting. Another one is Masters of Doom, which is the story of id Software, that made Doom, and Quake, and Wolfenstein 3D. I never played any of those games, didn’t really care about them. Even if you haven’t, it’s incredible. It’s one of my favorite audiobooks of all time. Then there are others where, again, you need to know the person in order to be super interested in it. I actually felt like John Romero, who is one of the id Software guys, has a book. It’s an autobiography called Doom Guy. That one was similar where it’s like, “This is cool.” But if you don’t know him or don’t know the story, I think it’s less interesting, so you have to weigh that. The reason I’m bringing this up is I think this is a helpful mindset or a helpful framework to think about why you’re recommending someone and letting someone know that. It’s like having strong tastes about particular elements of it. Because I get recommended, I’ll ask on Twitter or I will just get recommended stuff. I’m often like, “What did you like about it?” Because I want to figure out if our tastes are in line enough that it’s worth my time. It’s not the cost. Buying a book, whether it’s on Audible, or on Kindle, or in dead tree version, the cost is irrelevant for me. It is the time it’s going to take me to get into it and evaluate it. I dig in pretty deep on recommendations. I’ve had a lot of recommendations. Like I will ask specifically, “Hey, I’m looking for a book that goes deep on SaaS or startup marketing approaches.” I’ll say tactics, specifically marketing tactics, “I want to know a good one to recommend to people.” People will just recommend just crazy random (beep) like, “Shoe Dog by Phil Knight.” I’m like that’s not startup marketing, what are you talking about? Or someone recommended The Lean Startup. Its talks almost nothing about marketing. There’s nothing about marketing tactics in there. It’s this fundamental misunderstand of what the question asker … it’s like they see a keyword, maybe it was an AI answer. I don’t know, man. It’s like they see a keyword that says startup and the AI writes something. But you didn’t think it through, so usually I have a followup question of if I didn’t know any better, I wouldn’t know those were not good suggestions for what I was looking for. That’s why, if I’m going to recommend something to anyone, to a friend or to a startup founder, I will tell them, “I recommend you read this book and here is specifically why.” In fact, I recommended Chet Holmes Ultimate Sales Machine today. What I said is, “I think the book is 20 years old, so it’s a little dated. I also think there’s about a third of it that you don’t need to read, and there’s a third of it that is really focused on the Dream 100 customers. I think that’s what you really need. Then there’s a third that’s about business operations, and you can read that if you want to. But really, the reason I’m recommending it to you is because this whole concept around sales and how we does sales. Even though it’s outdated today, you’ll get the idea and you can adapt it.” That recommendation is so much more helpful than me saying, “You should read this book.” Not only does it tell you why, it puts guardrails around which part should you really focus on. “If you really like it, read the whole thing, but in the interest of your time being valuable, you can probably just read the part about the Dream 100.” It allows them to think internally, “Oh, this is why I should or shouldn’t read this.” And it allows them to think, “Maybe I shouldn’t.” Maybe the recommendation is off and I get to make that decision. I think being pretty descriptive when you make recommendations is certainly something that I’m doing and I hope it’s something that you will consider doing as well. That’s it for today’s episode.

In this episode, I sit down with Derrick Reimer, and we tackle I think it’s like six or seven, maybe even eight questions that were submitted on Twitter. When I let folks know Derrick and I were going to be having a conversation, got some really interesting questions from listeners just like yourself, questions about how Derrick validated or whether he validated his idea for SavvyCal, the most painful feature he’s built for SavvyCal, how his redesign worked out, what it’s like to have an opensource competitor raise a bunch of money and compete with him, and the key question you’re all wondering, is Derek looking to get on a regular weekly podcast again at some point in the future? Stick around to the end to find the answer to that, and with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Derrick. Derrick Reimer, it’s great to have you back on the show.  Derrick Reimer:Always a pleasure to be on the mics with you.  Rob Walling:Little do people know you are founder of SavvyCal and an author of the upcoming book, I’m Obsessed with Kerning.  Derrick Reimer:That’s a good one.  Rob Walling:The reason few people know that is because you’re not working on the book, but you are in fact obsessed with kerning. I had never heard the word kerning before I met you.  Derrick Reimer:Really? Yeah. I’ve always had a thing for fonts. I don’t know why. That was one of my childhood obsessions with my computer was exploring the world of fonts. Maybe in another life I could be a font designer.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Oh, I could see it in this life.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I probably could, not this season.  Rob Walling:After you exit SavvyCal for 50 million, you’re just on the beach designing fonts. I feel like you might’ve been called a nerd when you were younger, huh?  Derrick Reimer:Maybe a few times, yeah.  Rob Walling:Few times? When you were obsessing about fonts? That’s great.  Derrick Reimer:Fonts, accounting software.  Rob Walling:Oh, yeah, doing things in Photoshop that may or may not have a statute of limitations on them, meaning trying to replicate currency.  Derrick Reimer:Yup. There was that.  Rob Walling:We won’t talk about that. It was a hypothetical. So I was going to have you on the show and I had three or four topics I thought we could cover, and I was like, “You know, I might want one or two more.” So I go to Twitter. I mentioned that you’re coming on the show and just inundated in the best way with really good questions, topics, suggestions from a swath of people. So that’s what we’re going to do. We booted all my topics. Those will go into some other, I don’t know, maybe I’ll talk about them in the future. Maybe we’ll do them next time or whatever, but I want to dive right in. It won’t be a lightning round per se, but we probably do have, what, 8, 10, 12 things, not necessarily topics, questions to dive through. So our first one is from KP on Twitter, and we just met KP MicroConf in Atlanta. He is the host of the Build in Public Podcast, and his question for you is, “What’s the most painful feature that you’ve built for SavvyCal, pain as in which took longer and felt harder than you imagined?”  Derrick Reimer:I think we actually just built this feature, and it launched this past month called Group Scheduling Mode. So this is a feature that allows you to basically specify a link that allows multiple people to book the same time slot. So think of a webinar or a group coaching call, and it seems simple on the surface because it’s just a setting like what’s the maximum number of people you want to allow to book this, but under the covers, it basically touches almost every part of the scheduling infrastructure because we have so many places where we assume that only one person can be on a calendar event at a time booked through SavvyCal, I guess. Obviously, you can have calendar events with multiple people on them, but generally, the product assumed that when a booking occurs through SavvyCal, once that booking is in place, that time slot is blocked and not available for others to hop onto. So adding this meant, okay, so someone can book a time slot, and then if another person picks that and it hasn’t reached the limit yet, then they basically hop onto the calendar event, which is kind of a separate action. We need to notify in a different way about that. Then if that person decides to reschedule, well, now we need to remove them from that event and spin up a new event if it doesn’t exist already, but if they reschedule from an existing time slot to another time slot that already has a person attending, then we’re doing this lateral translation move of moving this attendee from one existing event to another. So you can see all the permutations that this takes. Ultimately, I feel like we’re in a better place. We had to refactor a bunch of the guts of the scheduling infrastructure to kind of pass around, change events, I guess you could say like one type of change is when an event is scheduled, another is when an attendee is added or an attendee rescheduled. So we kind of formalized the underlying infrastructure for this, which will set us up for being able to build integrations easier. So I’m happy that a lot of the work is not just for this feature, but, boy, it ended up a lot gnarlier than we anticipated at the outset.  Rob Walling:So when you quoted your manager an estimate of two days to complete it, how quickly did you realize, “Uh-oh, this is going to be a problem”?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah.  Rob Walling:I ran into a few of those, the iceberg problem of getting in and discovering. That’s the beauty, honestly. So I used to be a consultant. I was a contractor, and we would give estimates, and it’s like, “We bill 150 bucks an hour. I think it’s going to take probably 16 hours,” I might say or however many, and it’s like, “All right.” So the client’s like, “All right, 16 hours.” Sometimes you get six hours into that 16 hours and you realize, “Oh, no, this is an 80-hour project,” and you have to go back to them and say, “Look, we either don’t do this and we just lose the six or we move forward,” and it got even worse on big projects when you’re like, “Oh,” you estimate all these webpages or whatever, and you estimate 400, 500, 600 hours, and then you get in and you realize, “I was off by 10, 20%.” So that’s the beauty of being an entrepreneur is that you’re able to make that call and you could have just pulled the plug. You could have gotten three days in and been like, “You know what? This is not worth it,” and just killed it, but I’m guessing you did that calculus and you were like, “No, it’s worth doing,” for all the reasons you just said and you kept moving forward.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, there were definitely a few points where, because I never want to fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy if at all possible, so even a month in stepping back, and Taylor and I are talking about this daily as the project is going on and we’re talking about different snags and roadblocks that we’re running into and things that we know are going to expand the scope, and we would kind of regularly check in like, “Is this still worth it? Do we still want to do this?” I think it was only because we could see the follow-on benefits and the way that it makes the infrastructure better not just for this feature that kept us going because otherwise may have just pulled the plug and said, “Sorry, you can’t do that kind of thing with SavvyCal,” which sometimes you have to make those kinds of hard calls, but in this case, this one’s been requested basically from day one, and we have a huge long list of people who wanted it. So it was kind of like, “Yeah, if at all possible, we should probably add this.”  Rob Walling:Are there any other calendaring apps, scheduling links that do that? Because it seems like that would be not for mere mortals.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah. I was actually kind of surprised. Calendly does it, and it’s implemented similarly, I think. As part of our research on what might users be expecting, we took a hard look at how Calendly’s handling some of these changes and what happens when the last person on a group event reschedules, does the event just disappear? So we learned about and saw that all the edge cases they had to think through, we kind of teased them out in our testing and we’re able to get a good sense for, “Okay. I think they had to solve a lot of these heart problems too. We’re not just complicating this thing,” but as far as the others, I’m not sure. I think, yeah, definitely anyone else who has it had to go through a lot of pain.  Rob Walling:So thanks for that question, KP. Next question comes from Mark Gadala Maria, and he asks, “At what point would you think it’s time to give up on a SaaS idea and move on?” You and I have both each killed SaaS ideas. We’ve started things that we didn’t see through. We’ve started things that we did see through. So why don’t you weigh in first with your criteria of when it is you throw in the towel?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah. I mean, it’s a hard question because it’s so dependent on so many factors. Part of it is, how much energy do you have for something to keep working on it? Are you a Matt Wensing type where you’re kind of relentless and you keep pivoting and working off the same core but trying to find the right market? I have a lot of respect for entrepreneurs who have the grit to do that and the resources and the capability and all that, but these days, I try to think about the reasons why I would bail on an idea. So if there’s not enough demand or people just don’t seem to be problem aware or if I find there’s not really willingness to pay or maybe there’s some huge platform risk things or external factors like that or I can’t seem to find viable distribution channels, these are all reasons that would cause me to really pause and reevaluate. So I kind of think then in reverse like, “How can I get confidence that these things aren’t true as early as possible?” So generally, if the answer is I don’t know, then I would try to think through how to get an answer to those. You’re not going to know with 100% certainty in most cases. You can’t talk to the entire market unless you have a market of three people or something, but try to gain some degree of confidence on knowing that there actually is demand and that people are aware of the problem and they’re searching for it and they’re willing to pay and all those things.  Rob Walling:What you’re saying is that could be summarized as validation. You could say, “Oh, we bucket that all into validation.” I hear some people say, “Oh, yeah, validation doesn’t work,” or, “Oh, validation doesn’t work the way it used to,” or, “I don’t believe in validation,” or whatever. It’s like it does exist. It’s a thing. It’s not 100%, but what you’re saying is it’s learning, it’s research, it’s conversations. It’s like if I came up with a brand new idea and I told it to you and five other people, I would at least get some feedback, positive or negative, and then I would want to dig in and, as you said, look at search query, volley. There’s a bunch of stuff. We don’t have to go into what validation is, but I still today believe there’s no formula for validation. There’s no like, “Oh, do this,” and then you’re 20%, and then if you get 10 yeses, then you’re 50. It’s like there’s no exact number, but there’s this directional correctness in this founder gut. It’s incomplete information, and that’s you have to make a hard decision is, “Do I keep going?” but I’m totally on board with that.  Derrick Reimer:So with Level, which I think a lot of folks probably have heard me talk about this, wrote a blog post about it back in 2018 when I shut down that startup attempt, and that one I found contrary to what I expected or I just didn’t anticipate this, that the people who were most excited about it and were giving me all the positive signals were sort of downstream users of the product, and they weren’t the actual people responsible for buying it. So a lot of makers in an organization really disliked Slack and wanted something that was calmer, but the people who were charged with buying it were more of in the manager tier of the company, and they loved it. They loved the ability to ping an engineer anytime and get an answer quickly. So there was a disconnect on recognizing the actual core problem that I was trying to solve, and it was going to require more of a cultural shift for a lot of the people that I thought would be good customers for their organizations to actually buy into the premise was a whole different animal. To me, it just deemed too difficult, too risky. I’ve since watched others try to run a similar playbook and grow really, really slowly because there’s just so much headwind there. So that was just one anecdote from my experience.  Rob Walling:Look, it could be a matter of if you’d raised half a million dollars and spent years more working on it, maybe eventually it would work. You have to make the calculus at some point. You don’t know. The timing, I think of Slack being unseated, is probably coming. I think more and more people I’m hearing really don’t like it. I don’t know if that’s still a real thing though. If you built Level today, would you get any more at traction? I don’t know. You got to make the decision and move on. I say a lot that funded companies go out of business or fail when they run out of money, and bootstrap companies fail when the founder runs out of motivation. So that’s usually how I think about it is when I’m … To summarize it colloquially, it’s like when I run out of ideas, when I have no more ideas or no motivation to keep going, and when I say, I mean I would come to you, I would go to Ruben, I would go to Einar, I’d go to all Craig Hewitt, I’d go to all the smart people I know if today I was trying to grow something and it wasn’t growing, and I’d say, “Here’s the situation. What’s your thinking? What should I try?” Someone might be like, “Oh, you know what? I saw this other product do this thing,” and if you had an API layer, whatever, there might be ideas. As long as there were ideas on the table that I thought were viable much like back in the days of DripWord, it’s like, “We’re not growing, man. We are plateaued,” but ideas kept coming in of like, “Ooh, you could build automations. Oh, you could build a shopping cart, you could build affiliate management.” There’s all these ideas and we just had to figure out which one or ones do you pick. So I think that’s probably my thing. Now, the hard part is if you’re young or you’re new to all of this, you don’t have many ideas. So do you just quit? Do you just launch and then quit because you have no ideas? No, I think you get better at coming up with ideas. You learn from folks that are ahead of you. You learn from this podcast and the guests on this podcast like yourself, and you read the books in our space. There’s a lot of them, whatever it is, podcasts, there’s YouTube, however you’re going to learn about this so that you start to get a sense of, “What would Derrick Reimer do in this situation? How could I channel Derrick Reimer?” Maybe I train an AI bot on all of your podcast episodes and try to talk to it. I know a bunch of people that have done that with Startups for the Rest of Us. I actually think that’s an interesting idea of just come up with thoughts and ideas and then figure out, “Are these viable do and do I want to do them?” because at a certain point, you have viable ideas in front of you and you’re like, “I’m so (beep) tired of working on this. I just don’t have the motivation,” and at that point, you get to then take a beat because you don’t want to make an impulsive decision and shut it down overnight, but you get to take a beat and whether a beat is a day, a week, a month and take a breath and say, “Am I getting used to the idea of not working on this anymore?” and kind of let that sink in. So that’s probably my … I feel like I read a whole book chapter on this, but that’s as about as succinct as I can get it to when I give up on something or shut down an effort.  Derrick Reimer:I’m seeing more and more people kind of pulling the line of nobody really knows what they’re doing, this is all kind of luck anyways, so you just launch a bunch of stuff, right?  Rob Walling:It kills me. Absolutely.  Derrick Reimer:I guess that is a way you could do it. So you could start something and then not really pursue a bunch of ideas on how to actually grow it and then just kind of let it sit and wait and see if something hits randomly, but I think the whole-  Rob Walling:The roulette, the roulette approach, the lottery ticket approach to building a bootstrap startup, right?  Derrick Reimer:Right, and I think there always is a certain amount of timing and luck that has to get woven in as you’re systematically trying to get traction for something like we’re not 100% responsible for all of our traction. There’s always going to be a little bit of the timing, and honestly, hopefully it correlates with you identifying a problem that maybe the market needs. So you intuited that there was an opportunity here, which increases your odds of getting lucky, I guess, with the timing. I would say for me, I’ve always been of the mind that if I’m going to work on something, I want to really focus on it and give it the best shot at succeeding, and if that’s not happening, I think it’s really hard to set a SaaS on the side and just wait for it to take off because SaaSes are not really, you can’t autopilot a SaaS. I haven’t really seen it happen with much success. So for me, it just is not worth the effort of trying to keep something running on the back burner, but not really investing effort into it. So if I was up against that, do I put this on the side and wait for it to magically start growing or do I just throw my effort behind something else, I would be more apt to just throw my effort behind something else.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that’s a good summary of it. This is always hard, especially when it’s a gut feel and you’re going to have to ask yourself questions, and it’s different for different people, but I think knowing yourself is another part of it of, “Do I give up on things too early? Do I not push on them? Then I should probably stick with this for longer, but am I the person that stays with the same idea for six years when it still has four customers?” Well, then you should probably not do that again. There’s also that kind of personality factor. So appreciate the question. Next question comes from Kartik Manjunath, and he asks, “How do you find customers in a crowded market when SavvyCal is competing against the likes of Calendly?” That’s not only a crowded market, but it’s like there is a 900-pound gorilla as well. Not all crowded markets have a 900-pound gorilla, and not all 900-pound gorilla markets are crowded. Sometimes there’s one big player and there aren’t too much competition, but you are in one of those spaces that has both. So how does one get customers, Mr. Reimer?  Derrick Reimer:As I was thinking about this question, I was trying to figure out if it’s really much different in a “crowded market” than a not crowded market because, I mean, fundamentally, it’s the same. You got to show up in front of prospects who have some purchase intent, some demand, and then you have to present them with positioning and a message that resonates with what they care about. So when I think about how SavvyCal, how we position ourselves against Calendly, I mean, obviously, it would be very tough to just copy their H1 and lead with the exact same messaging. That’s a recipe for failure right there. So I think it’s figuring out how to really authentically identify some traits or some qualities about what you’re offering that is meaningfully different. Then I think it’s a lot of blocking and tackling on trying to run the playbooks so that you do show up in the places where people are looking for things. So that’s trying to get listed in the Listicles, where if someone searches scheduling software and they see a bunch of articles that are showing top 10 lists, can you get in those articles? Can you get in the Zapier blog when they’re talking about automating scheduling? There’s a bunch of these things that take time and effort and varying degrees of success, but basically trying to get in the conversation as much as possible is how I think about it. I think for SavvyCal too, there are some things that are to our advantage like the inherent virality of the product is a helpful dynamic for SavvyCal, and it’s not necessarily there for other products. So every time someone uses it, they’re exposing our brand to the person on the other side, which I think is a pretty big lever. It’s admittedly pretty difficult for us to measure because I think a lot of times there’s kind of initial touch and then maybe they book multiple times and it gets them thinking, and then whenever they’re ready to purchase scheduling tool, now SavvyCal is sort of in their mind because they’ve already been on the other side of it. So it’s kind of hard to track through the whole chain of touchpoints to attribute to virality, but I definitely know in qualitatively asking customers when they sign up, “How did you hear about us?” a lot of people talk about, “I used such-and-such as link.” So there’s things like that that just help drive that exposure, but, yeah, I mean, crowded markets, it is tough. Like If I search scheduling software in Google, I mean, there’s hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tools. So you can’t just rely on those head keywords and trying to rank them. You got to get a little craftier, I guess.  Rob Walling:When I think about it super simply, if someone were to say one sentence how do you do it because it’s way more than a sentence, but one sentence, I piggyback on what you said, which is you have to figure out how to be differentiated and/or you want to find what I’ll call proprietary or owned traffic channels. I can’t figure out the exact word for this, but I think of Rubin with Seinwell, where dude is really good at SEO like to an extreme. If you enter any space and you can rank for those head terms, you can get a lot of traffic. Rubin also differentiated Seinwell, like he has features that all his competitors don’t. One or the other though can get you customers. You could actually have kind of a clone of the big player. If you had massive, let’s say you got 50,000, 100,000 uniques a month and you were top three in Google, you would grow, not as fast as if you were also differentiated. That’s why I said and and or. I try to do both, but you can’t always do both. To quote from page 51 of the SaaS Playbook, “How can I compete in a competitive market? A mature competitive market can be a total bloodbath, but it can also be a fantastic place to grow your business once you get a foothold.” Then I go through. Here are different ways to get a foothold. So one, compete on price, and I say competing on price is tricky, but you can get traction if you offer more than 80% of the product for half the cost. You get it. It’s not exact numbers, but it’s there. I go through five paragraphs of that, compete on sales model. So oftentimes, incumbents in competitive markets have high touch sales process where customers may schedule a demo and mandatory setup fees, and it’s just a big pain in the ass. I don’t put that in the book, but I’m ad libing here. So you can go in and do a self server, a lower server, a one call closer or whatever. Compete on product, that’s a little bit what you and I are talking about or trying to differentiate. Now, later in the book I talk about features are temporary moats because people replicate your features, which I think you’ve experienced to a large extent. Then I have how to market against large competitors, how much should I worry about them. I talk about building moats and different types. Anyways, there’s enough content. I’m not trying to plug the book, but there’s a reason I put that in there because it is really important. This is not a 10-minute podcast answer. This is a big answer of it’s a lot of things to compete in a competitive market, but if you can do it, it’s a superpower because competitive markets usually are large and that’s why they have competition, and so you can grow faster. Usually, I would say competitive markets are often growing quickly. That’s why everyone’s launching in them. So thanks for that question. Next question is from Aboma Kelly, and they ask, “Question for Derrick. Do you have any plans or desire to start podcasting again on a regular basis or are you officially retired?”  Derrick Reimer:Officially retired.  Rob Walling:That is like that, huh? Do you want to tell them our little secret of how we specifically had this conversation?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah. We talked about this over cocktails a couple months ago, I think. I’m really enjoying doing episodes just like this one on this podcast. So for those who don’t know, I used to do one of those kind of check-in on what you’re working on every week type of podcast. It was called The Art of Product. Me and Ben Orenstein from Tuple did that for, gosh, five, six years. It was both a lot of fun, helped me build a small audience and a little community, but also, it was a ton of work. It was taxing on me. I think for Ben, it was an easier thing. So I think it kind of depends on your personality, but for me, it was like I always felt this pressure to have something smart to say and summarize, well, my learnings from the last week, and I just found it was kind of ended up being a little bit of an energy drain. So I think while I hear from a lot of folks that they miss The Art of Product and they really enjoyed the content, in that regard, I wish I had the energy and the ability to keep that cadence going, but I don’t know, I think I’m done with that sort of podcasting, but I really love showing up here and answering listener questions and just talking about stuff.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and that was, as you said, we were having cocktails and I said, “Well, do you just want to come on every, I don’t know, six, eight weeks to the show, just I leave it as a standing invite, you ping me whenever, it’s not a recurring calendar invite, but just come on quite a bit as a guest?” and you were like, “Yeah, why not? Let’s try it.” So we haven’t told anybody until now, but that’s the idea of getting you back on the show, and they’re so easy. These are easy recordings. We always have topics. Even if I hadn’t tweeted today, we would fill 35 40 minutes of good content. So I think of it less as retiring and more of moving to that next stage, that next phase like when someone has a big exit, they often become, what, an investor or some other thing, and you are like, “You know what? I had a big exit from Art of Product and now I’m investing in the rest of the community.” The braid metaphor broke down around there. Anyways, thanks a lot for that question. Hope it was helpful. TinySeed’s own Einar Vollset asks, “How did it feel to get an open source competitor entering the market with $40 million in funding and that would have developers work for free to rip off,” his words, “rip off every innovative feature that you added?”  Derrick Reimer:Oh, Einar, good question.  Rob Walling:I love the wording of it. It’s like I feel great. It feels amazing.  Derrick Reimer:By the way, those are Einar’s words, not mine. Yeah, no, but honestly, on this topic, I guess in general, I would say these kinds of things like having competitors that are quite active in the market and obviously looking around at the stuff that other people are building, and that includes us as a participant in the market, it really does help you to more quickly understand what your actual differentiators are. I think you point this out in the SaaS Playbook about how features are not moats because there’s not really intellectual property protection in that way for what we’re doing in the software space. Anyone can look at an interface and say, “I like that. Let’s build that.” There’s no recourse. There’s nothing proprietary, so to speak, in that. So I think when you’re seeing some of your key interfaces showing up in other places, it’s disheartening at first, but also, it just makes you realize, “Ultimately, I can make my business stronger by not trying to rely so much on things that are ultimately not defensible.” So I think that’s what we’ve been, with this latest brand refresh that we did, we’re trying to really sharpen our positioning a bit to really speak to the people who come across us in the market as they’re searching around for tools like, “Why do they choose us? Why do they like SavvyCal?” We had a lot of conversations with people about this and mined through different survey data that we’ve run over the years and just workshopped it a bit and tried to get a sense for this. I think it’s like people like SavvyCal because we’re small and nimble, because they trust us to listen to customers. We started out in response to Calendly not really changing much over the years, and there were many, many forums where people were asking for stuff and they just sort of felt like they weren’t being listened to. So we showed up as like, “Hey, we’re a scrappy upstart looking to talk to customers and figure out how to build the best tool possible. We’re going to sweat the details.” So these are all things that we’re trying to call out. I think a company that’s riding on a huge batch of venture capital and trying to grow as quickly as possible probably doesn’t care about the same details. So I think we can call out some of that stuff. It’s a little fuzzier than saying, “We have this feature and they don’t have this feature,” but ultimately, features are all, I don’t know, yeah, it’s not super defensible. So I guess that’s how we think about it, and ultimately, I think it does help us be a stronger company.  Rob Walling:All right. We have four more questions to get through. Two are from Greg Deneo. His first question is, “How is Derrick’s redesign working out, the SavvyCal redesign?” So for folks who don’t know, you redesigned the home page inside the app as well. It’s a pretty significant one, right?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, not much in the app, although we did at the same time release a refreshed link editor, the core-  Rob Walling:That’s what it was.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, the core editing interface in the app with a bunch of UX improvements and a refreshed marketing site, refreshed logo. It’s been really well-received.  Rob Walling:Did you change your H1 as well?  Derrick Reimer:Yup. H1 changed a bit.  Rob Walling:You changed some copy?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah. Most of the copy on the home page is different. Added a features page, so one place to kind of summarize key features, and then we’re gradually porting over the other pages to match the design aesthetic, but, yeah, it’s been really well received. I mean, people have recognized the effort that we put into it to try to … We didn’t want it to feel like your typical startup, safe, corporate startup, blue and white landing page. We wanted it to feel organic, and we wanted the design to communicate similar values that we were saying in our words. I feel like we nailed it. I think, yeah, it’s been well-received. We’ve had our best sales month this last month that we’ve had in a long time, so yeah.  Rob Walling:Do you attribute that at least partially to the new look?  Derrick Reimer:I mean, I think we made a lot of noise when launching the brand refresh and sent some emails to the list. So it’s hard to say that it’s attributable directly to the refresh design, but it was nice to have an excuse to go out and ship a bunch of stuff. We shipped that group scheduling feature and the refresh link editor and the brand refresh. So hopefully that that’s just another indicator that there’s energy and momentum behind the company, which I think helps with marketing effort.  Rob Walling:Neat, and I mean even the home page. So I don’t see the home page because when I go to savvycal.com, I’m logged in, so I never … I know I can log out.  Derrick Reimer:Oh, yeah, you can go to slash home.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and I went incognito to look at it now, but just as a rule, when I go to SavvyCal, I never see the home page because it has me logged in, but I did see you announced it on Twitter and then I checked it out. I mean, the green, the fonts, the kerning, all the things that you care the most about, I mean, it looks great. It looks really, really solid. So yeah, I think you should be happy with it. Greg’s other question is, “Was there ever a consideration for launching SavvyCal as a vertical SaaS?” I will actually add to this, launching or narrowing focus at any time. He says, “For example, a calendar scheduling link for salespeople, for lawyers, for insert any customer segment that you enjoy working with.”  Derrick Reimer:Yup, that’s a good question. So I mean, initially, the thinking was to be horizontally positioned and pick up on signals on who’s getting the most value out of this and potentially refined positioning or narrow things a bit. To date, I mean, we have a very diverse set of customers, which is both good and bad. It’s good in that we’re hitting the mark on being a general purpose tool for a lot of different people, but the challenge is we have to try to identify the commonalities between them and figure out like, “Should we go after one specific set or should we keep speaking to the same messaging that resonated with this diverse set of customers?” I think we’ve experimented with things here and there, but haven’t gone as far as fully updating the H1 on the home page to speak to a specific vertical. I mean, I think in order to do that, I would want to have a strong enough hypothesis that basically, that I’d be willing to exclude some of the people that maybe otherwise would’ve signed up like if they saw that this is for sales teams on the H1, someone who’s not doing sales probably would choose not to sign up versus if we did. So I see that as the more mature the business gets, the riskier it feels to make that kind of shift, but I think in smaller ways, we experimented with like for a couple of months we’ll spend some time building features for sales teams and we’ll work on some things, some efforts to try to see, gauge how it’s resonating aside from fully shifting the positioning on the homepage, if that makes sense.  Rob Walling:You have to be pretty certain of that to make such a strategic shift, I think. So it’s one of those I would need to sit with for a very long time. I mean, I can bring up a bunch of examples, it doesn’t really matter, but any big strategic shift like that, I need probably months of mulling it over and saying it out loud internally and saying, “I think this is where we need to go. What do you think?” and then I sleep on it for a week and then I come back to it and I try it on again. It’s one of those things of like, “Does this really feel right?” Oftentimes, I can’t remember. It’s been very few times where I’ve made a decision of that magnitude quickly and without some pretty strong … I need some strong conviction that it’s the right call. Sometimes if you don’t have that, it’s tough. It’s tough to think about doing it.  Derrick Reimer:The hypothesis around that niche down needs to be as strong or stronger than the one that’s currently working for the business. It has to overcome that, I think for me.  Rob Walling:Yup, and I think there’s also has to be a bit of excitement, your internal excitement of like, “Oh, I’m really excited to work on this and I really want to dive deep into this.” So thanks for those questions, Greg. Last two questions from Chris Livdahl. He asks, “How did you land on the idea for SavvyCal among others that you decided to pursue, and did you validate the idea before launching it, and if so, how did you validate it?”  Derrick Reimer:So I made couple of bullet points here. I’m trying to capture what my initial thinking was because it’s funny how it does shift over time, but I could think back to what was I thinking back in 2020 when I was just starting to pursue this. So the thinking was Calendly doesn’t seem to be innovating much these days. They’ve been kind of the household name, so to speak, for this type of product, but the product hasn’t really shifted that much and it doesn’t seem like they’re really listening to customers that closely. For me, it was big that it would be a relatively quick to get an MVP to market, to build a basic scheduling functionality. So I felt confident that I could start to test this with an actual product in hand pretty quickly. It’s a product that has the virality built in, so that was a big selling point for me too. A lot of my existing audience uses scheduling tools. I think about this as this is like kindling for the fire. I can’t rely on personal audience to sustain the entire business, but it’s enough to get maybe a kernel of customers that are really excited about it and willing to start using it and spreading the SavvyCal name and talking about it to their friends and helping get the wheels moving on this thing. So that was an important thing for me. Since I had a small existing audience, I wanted to leverage that. Then there was this hook that I picked up on. It was the power dynamic issue. So I feel like every other week there was a Twitter thread where someone was opining that Calendly is rude and it’s not good professional form to send a Calendly link to somebody because of the power dynamic issues. You’re forcing me to do work to get on your calendar sort of thing. It was an interesting like it’s both a people problem and I think a technology problem. I think the tech can help it feel a bit more collaborative so it doesn’t feel as off-putting to receive, but it’s also like, are you exhibiting good etiquette? This was enough of a hook where it’s like, “Well, what if we could build a tool that doesn’t feel so awkward, that feels more collaborative, feels more personal?” and that was the initial hook. So I think we wrote a little manifesto talking about the power dynamic and how we’re going to fix it. We had this visual booking interface and personalization and a bunch of other little details that were going to make this better, and put that on a landing page and started to gather email addresses and have conversations with potential customers and engage interest. I think that was the extent of the validation, and then I got down to work building an MVP, and within a couple of months was able to start testing it out with real users.  Rob Walling:To take you back even further, I believe you started even considering … You had a list of software that Calendly was on, and that list came from what did we pay for at Drip, what was all the software we paid for, right? There was GitHub and Slack and Calendly. You can imagine what the stack was. You came over, we sat in my front room and we’re talking through like, “Which of these can be disrupted.” You’d already tried to disrupt Slack with Level and that hadn’t panned out, but we were looking at, “Are you going to compete with GitHub? Not directly, but is there a thing there? Is there, whatever?” We went down the list and marked off like, “Oh, these are bootstrappable or mostly bootstrappable businesses.” Then we said, “Which of these has an in?” because that’s the other thing. It’s like, again, Stripe, probably not a bootstrappable competitor business, but there were some, I don’t remember what they were, but it was like, “Oh, there’s this product, but people love that product,” and there’s no wedge, there’s no differentiation, there’s no angle, there are no people complaining about it or whatever. That was what we determined. Calendly was one of a couple, I don’t remember what they were, but there were two or three where it was like, “Ooh, any of these you could probably do.” You then talked to me and I said, “Look, I would pay for a Calendly alternative that did X, Y, Z.” I think at the time it was like that integrated with my podcast recording suite, whether that’s Squadcast or Riverside or whatever, but it integrates and automatically creates a room, and it’s like, “I don’t think Calendly is going to build that.” Then you talked to other people. I think you talked to Wensing. You probably talked to Peter. You talked to Einar, and you talked to all these people and said, “What don’t you like about this?” and you were trying to get that of like, “How do I be different?” because again we said, “You could have just gone and replicated Calendly. You’re a good builder. You could have done it. It’d been elegant,” and all that stuff, but that doesn’t get you there. So yeah, I just wanted to take people back even further because by the time, you had already gone through a process just to narrow down to what space, what category. Notice you didn’t start with a technology and say, “What can this do?” You didn’t start with, “What new novel thing that has no category can I build?” You were like, “I really want to enter an existing category.” Everything on that list was super competitive. There are a bunch of tools and there’s a big leader in almost all of them. I’ve actually quoted that process. I have this book that I will publish it eventually, it’s probably going to be next year. It’s called the SaaS Launchpad. It’s a precursor to the SaaS Playbook, and it’s about coming up with ideas, trying to validate, pre-validate, launching, building a launch, just all the early stuff that comes before that. It’s a hard book to write because it’s so squishy. You can hear us, even you and I, experienced entrepreneurs done it multiple times. It’s still a very squishy process. So to actually put it in writing is like you need a lot of, “Well, this, it depends, this and that,” but one of the chapters is about coming up with ideas like this. I have seven different approaches, and one of them is make a list of all the things that your company pays for an hour that you pay for an hour. I totally got this from you doing it. Others are like, “Hey, take a vertical SaaS and go horizontal or a horizontal SaaS and go vertical,” or you have a bad customer experience and you can improve, blah, blah, blah. You can imagine the list of those seven kind of … They’re not frameworks on themselves, kind of a single framework, but I think this is a super interesting way to ideate. Then the thing is is how do you get to that next step. How do you not just pick it and say, “Ohm boy, I want to be in that space,” and you don’t take the next step, which is, “Now let’s research. Now let’s find out what the weaknesses are. Now let’s find out what people are unhappy with in this space so that I can at least have some type of wedge or angle or focus that differentiates me from the big incumbent.”  Derrick Reimer:Yup, and also when I was taking that list and evaluating them against each other, there’s all kinds of criteria I’m looking at, but one of the ones I was careful to do this time around especially was like, “All right. I want to make sure that this has as close a fit to what my ambitions are and the way that I want to work,” because assuming that I don’t have to work on this for the next several years, what’s the founder fit element of it? I hadn’t always necessarily considered that. It was kind of like, “Well, we’ll figure it out. I’m willing to do whatever. Let’s just find a good idea.” There’s a blog post, somebody who’s written in 2019, and maybe this list would be a little different now if I made the same one, but it was a helpful exercise at the time to write these things down, and part of it was coming off of the level experience. I could tell some of these are a reaction to that because I felt a little burned by some of the things that I experienced through that, but I’ll just read it off real quick. I have these filters, right? The filters were the market must already exist, so I’m not inventing a category. MVP must must be shippable within a few months. Level took a long time. I spent, I think, nine months on it before I was able to get it in front of anyone, which was way too long. I way over engineered it. The product should not be mission-critical. It should be important, obviously, high value, but not something where if we have five minutes of downtime, we’ve severely impacted someone’s business like processing high volume e-commerce payments or something like that. Making a sale shouldn’t require more than a few decision makers because with Level it was like, “Oh, you have to get buy-in from the entire company.” Yeah, that’s not great. Native apps shouldn’t be a minimum requirement. I wanted to be able to focus on web and maybe a progressive web app or something, but not have to build a mobile app. I think this is kind of another level thing too. People wanted to be able to access messages across all platforms with native apps and it’s like, “Okay.” Well, that adds a whole ton of development time to get something minimally viable. Then lastly, the market should overlap with my existing audience because I wanted to be able to leverage as much of my unfair advantages or whatever that I had. So I wanted to use my audience as kindling and not just go into a completely foreign space where no one knows me, and those were my filters.  Rob Walling:Derrick Reimer dropping knowledge bombs as always.

Let’s dive in. Marie, welcome to Startups For the Rest of Us.  Marie Martens:Thank you so much for having me.  Rob Walling:I’m excited to talk to you today about Tally and that’s at tally.so. Your H1 is the simplest way to create forms, say goodbye to boring forms, meet Tally, the free intuitive form builder you’ve been looking for.  Marie Martens:Correct.  Rob Walling:And you’re quite the success story with the Indie Hacker build in public crowd in the sense that you are one of, I’ll say, it’s a small number of folks who are trying to launch things and be a lifestyle bootstrapper, and you’re one of the small number that has really achieved some marked success with it. Can you give us an idea of where the business is today because you’ve been very public about numbers, I’ve heard you talk about in other presentations, but where do you stand?  Marie Martens:Yeah, we now have around 300,000 users worldwide using Tally. Most of them are free. We have around 4,500 paying customers and that results in 1.3 million ARR today.  Rob Walling:That’s incredible. And that’s over the course of what, three years? Did you launch in 2021?  Marie Martens:Yeah, so after summer it will be four years. Yep.  Rob Walling:Four years. Okay. So let’s back the clock up that gives people an idea of where you are. Oh, and how large is your team?  Marie Martens:So we’re actually like two and a half people. I would say. We don’t have any full-time employees yet. That will change soon though. So it’s basically me and Filip. Filip is my technical co-founder, but also my partner in life. And then, we have a freelancer helping us out part-time for customer support.  Rob Walling:You have 300,000 users and a part-time customer support person. That is incredible. Are you and Filip doing support as well?  Marie Martens:Not anymore. We do once in a while, but it’s definitely not our main task anymore, no.  Rob Walling:How is it possible with that many users that you don’t have ’cause my last SaaS Drip, we had 12 full-time customer support people by the time we had, I think, it was 30,000 or 40,000 free users. So obviously, different products. Drip is very complicated. It’s marketing automation, it’s a lot more expensive and all that. Is it that just the nature of Tally that it’s so easy to build a form and you just kind of know what you’re doing? How would that possibly not be a full-time job?  Marie Martens:Yeah, I think the main ingredient there is that we really try to keep the product simple. So as you read on the website, simplest way to create forms, so the simpler, the easier for people to use. So there’s a heavy focus on that user experience. Besides that, we have invested a lot in documenting, in creating tutorials and making sure that it is self-service. It is worthwhile mentioning that now it’s one part-time person, but we are actually hiring two more people, but they will also work a couple of hours a day basically, but in different time zones so that we can reduce our response time because now it’s like max one day, but it is getting difficult. So that’s an important note there. But yeah, I think why, I think because of the product really, the product itself is pretty intuitive and people can find their own way through it. But definitely support has been an important factor in our journey. We can maybe talk about it a bit more later and has come with ups and downs. We have had to implement a lot of new measures to keep it manageable, but yeah, for now it’s one part-time person.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and I think intuitive is one thing, but a lot of us build intuitive software. I get the feeling that it’s the nature of the product that if you’re going to build a form builder, you know you’re going to type some stuff out, you’re going to drag and drop something and then you’re going to post it, and that’s it. There’s not a ton of complexity on that. I think of it also like electronic signature, like Ruben Gomez, who comes on the show a lot, has SignWell, and there’s stuff to that product, but really it’s like you sign in, you upload a document and someone signs it or they don’t, that’s the extent of the process. It is just a simpler product than like a CRM or marketing automation. Yeah.  Marie Martens:Definitely there’s that and I think where it becomes complex is integrations because forms are usually the beginning of the workflow. So a lot of support is also about that. The moment it gets a bit more technical, you can inject custom CSS, stuff like that. It can get pretty advanced because people build crazy things with no code tools, but at the heart it’s just a form indeed, first name, last name, e-mail, so most people can make that work. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Okay, so let’s step back a little bit to let’s say 2021 or around the time you launched. There were already dozens, if not hundreds, of form builders. So what did you do in the early days? And I heard some rumblings about cold outreach that you were doing, which is crazy to me because A) if you have a free plan and B) you’re only paid plan, so folks now is $29 a month, cold outreach doesn’t work at that scale. You can’t make money on a product doing cold outreach at 29. So you were doing cold outreach for other reasons. What were you doing to get it kick-started and to get people to pay attention when there’s already a 150, 200, 300 form builders out there?  Marie Martens:So I think there’s two parts. So we’re bootstrapped and we’re a small team and from the beginning, we were very conscious about that. We wanted to keep it bootstrapped, we wanted to keep it small and lean. And so for us, it seemed easier to go in a very competitive market. You know there’s demand, but where we can just grab that small percentage of the market and if we can manage to do that, that’s already huge for us because we’re so small, we don’t have to earn as much as the big players. Of course, downside of that is that we don’t have the marketing budgets of the big ones. So we had to do something different. We didn’t have any network in the space. So we mainly launched in the beginning in no-code communities and on Indie Hackers. And to basically get the first users, we did cold outreach because that was the simplest way to do. We would go on Product Hunt. On Product Hunt, we would look at people that have uploaded similar products like ours or no-code tools, so not necessarily form builders. We would make lists of them, hundreds, thousands of them, in a Google sheet and find manually, at the time, their contact details and reach out to them. So that’s basically what I did, I think, for four or five months nonstop every day while Filip was building and improving the MVP. And by doing that, we found our way into some communities. One of them was No-Code France, which is pretty big in Europe and Belgium. The whole no-code movement was not really happening yet. They helped us a lot in the start, promoting us, sharing us in their community, and that’s how we found our first thousand users by simply DM’ing people.  Rob Walling:That’s crazy. Talk about doing things that don’t scale, right? Paul Graham talks about that. Again, I don’t know if you’re cool with I lump you into the Indie Hacker built in public space. Is that what happened?  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Do you identify with that?  Marie Martens:Yes.  Rob Walling:Yeah, so most Indie Hackers that I see want to post on Twitter and then build a huge following and then launch stuff to them, but not do the grind, the cold outreach. Were you a free tool? Were you cold outreaching to get people to come use a free tool or did you have recharging? So it was free?  Marie Martens:It was free.  Rob Walling:Wow.  Marie Martens:We just wanted to get people on board. We had our TallyPro, our subscription, our paid plan after a couple of months, but we didn’t have any in the beginning. And actually, one of our first users said, “Oh man, I really love this. Where can I pay?” And we didn’t have, you couldn’t pay it and then, that was for us a very early sign of, “Okay, we might be onto something.” He’s actually still, we then made this $5 a month and he’s still on this plan just to have them support us. I guess that’s the success formula of Tally is that we’ve given so much value for free and we’ve built a product that some people really love to use and so it becomes a no-brainer for them to pay for it once they can.  Rob Walling:Right. And I do want to call out here for listeners because a lot of people try free and I would say 9 out of 10 who try it, doesn’t work, maybe 95 out of a 100, it is a lot of lot.  Marie Martens:Yes.  Rob Walling:And Ruben Gomez has these four markers that I often quote, I actually put them in my book, “When freemium can work and if you don’t have all four of them, you probably shouldn’t try freemium.” One is that you have almost zero support and we’ve already covered that ’cause again, if you had to go free and you have 10,000 users and you need to support them, catastrophically expensive if you’re scaling up. The second is there’s no real incremental cost for new users, meaning a new user signs up.= let’s say I had an SMS app where I’m sending text messages, very, very expensive to send SMS, very expensive. AI, very expensive. There’s certain, even e-mail is not very expensive, but there’s a little cost to it. So really having zero, almost zero marginal cost, which it sounds like you do. The third is that folks can self-onboard and they can get very quick value from the product. So back to my earlier example, electronic signature has a free plan, SignWell does. If you’re going to have someone e-sign a doc, what do you do? You log in, you upload a doc, they sign. It’s very quick to value. With a form builder, I bet I could build a form in Tally in 5 or 10 minutes if I half-ass knew what I was doing and post.  Marie Martens:In less, and we don’t even require to sign up. So you can literally go to the website and do it.  Rob Walling:So super quick to value, so this makes sense, versus a CRM, marketing automation e-mail where you’re like building workflow, it’s a different type of tool. And the fourth one is some measure of virality and if you have a free plan with no virality, it’s usually, don’t do it, it’s not worth it. But you as a form builder, if I set up a Tally form and I share it with people, you have a logo I’m assuming, and some type of, you’re at Tally.so, right?  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Got it, got it.  Marie Martens:So we have the virality baked in because forms are viral by nature, and that’s why we invest a lot in getting free users because they are the biggest growth engine of our product, basically  Rob Walling:That’s your engine and that’s what I want to call out to folks listening is it is the, I’ll say the Indie Hacker dream or the lifestyle bootstrappers dream to just never talk to any human and build a product that does 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 a month and so often, people get pulled to freemium because they’re like, “Oh, well Tally made it work, so I’m going to do free too.” But it’s like unless you have what Tally does, which is a very simple product, which is super elegant, which needs no support, all these things, you really shouldn’t try this. It just doesn’t work. And I see people trying it and failing. In fact, when I was, so I sold Drip, which was e-mail marketing automation provider, and the acquirers were venture funded, $38 million in venture. That’s how they could afford to buy us, and they introduced a free plan. I was still there at the time and I was like, “I don’t know if this is going to work, guys. I’m fine to do whatever you want. You’re running the company. I was running product at the time. If you want to do free, we’ll implement it, but I just don’t know.” And it kind of didn’t.  Marie Martens:It didn’t work.  Rob Walling:It really didn’t because it didn’t have… We had a little bit of virality, right? It was like, “Oh, an e-mail with this, powered by a Drip link.”  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:But the other stuff was not. There is no support, there is incremental costs ’cause we were sending hundreds of millions of e-mails a month. There was no self-onboarding and quick to value, it was just one out of four at most. So I want to call that out, like you’ve built an incredible business with this approach, but I don’t want everyone listening to think, “Oh, well, I’ll just do the same thing” because you really need, do you agree? I’m sitting here and kind of preaching at you, but yeah-  Marie Martens:I totally agree. Yeah, I totally agree. I think for us, one of the main reasons as well is that we made it free is because we had to do something else than the market at that time. Because we are so small and the type forms and job forms, they all have volume-based pricing, and that’s something that we didn’t want to do. So we have to make it free at the cost, of course, of having to support a lot of free users, but we have to do that to differentiate ourselves in the market. And Tally would not be where it is today without a free plan. We have grown organically. Until now, we haven’t invested anything in paid acquisition. So not making it free was not really an option for us.  Rob Walling:Yeah. That was a marketing channel. Yeah, well, you can’t invest in paid acquisition at your lifetime value. It just wouldn’t work.  Marie Martens:No.  Rob Walling:29 bucks a month, even if everyone you acquired upgraded a $29-a-month plan, there are no ads anywhere on earth-  Marie Martens:Indeed.  Rob Walling:… That you can make that LTV work. So it makes sense that this is your growth engine is the free thing. Now, did you know this going in? All the stuff we just talked about where I was like, oh, free is actually quite hard and it only works 1 out of 10, one out of whatever, 5 out of a 100, did you know that going in and you were really strategic and surgical about it or did you get lucky where it was like, “We’re going to try free? Oh my gosh, it worked.”  Marie Martens:We were pretty strategic about it being free. I think we didn’t fully know the power of the virality and how the whole product-led growth system would work, but we knew that it had to be free and that we had to stick to this and that it also wouldn’t always be great. We would make less money, but we had to keep it free in order to grow. And that’s the framework in which we were operating and we were still sticking to that. It needs to be free and needs to be simple. That’s what makes it work for Tally. So we knew that, but we definitely couldn’t predict that it would grow in the way that it did. So it’s not like we knew everything when we started, definitely not. Yeah,  Rob Walling:I’ve never heard of anyone doing cold outreach for a free tool with no paid plan. That’s crazy. But you were doing it, just you were trying to get the momentum, right?  Marie Martens:Yeah, we were trying to get the word out there like we’ve built something new. It’s a bit different than at the time what was at the market. Also, we launched four years ago. I think the last two years, a lot of people have launched new form builders, but I feel like they were a bit less bootstrapped ones at the time, and we just wanted to get the word out there and find those first users. And we managed, I think we got around a 20% response rate to our cold outreach, which is pretty crazy. Of course, it was pretty targeted. We would really go to founders, people in design, people in no-code, people in product, like people that used Notion because we have a similar interface like them, so that definitely also helped us. And yeah, the cold outreach, it’s something that I would definitely actually recommend and I would do it again because we needed that first batch of thousand users to get the flywheel going and to start product led growth.  Rob Walling:We’ve been partnering with lemon.io for several years and they’ve proven to be a great choice when it comes to hiring for a highly skilled developer to work on your project.

It’s where you come in. So Craigslist did this with classified ads, newspaper classified ads where they came in and they basically were like, “Hey, we’re free,” and newspaper classified ads just collapsed. And then frankly, the newspaper business kind of collapsed because that was their main source of revenue. You see it when Make competing against Zapier where they come in and they’re like, “We’re 80% of Zapier or whatever the functionality is, and we are way cheaper.” And you see this with folks going against Salesforce, where Zapier and Salesforce, they still have the brand names, but competitors coming under them and really underpricing them. And it feels like you did the same thing here with what Jotform and Typeform and Paperform and Formstack and SurveyMonkey and Wufoo and Xeroform, Microsoft forms, ServicePro and there are a lot of them out there, but they charge, especially as they get larger, they follow the pricing playbook. This is what we talk about at TinySeed. This is what I talk about in my book of like, “Hey, if people are getting million form requests per month, they should be paying you a load of money,” because they’re getting a ton of value and that the money they pay you should increase with the value. That’s like the playbook they run, and it’s the playbook I run, frankly. But you haven’t done that. You have a free plan and you have a $29-a-month plan, which honestly kills me. If I were to invest in you, I’d be like, “Oh my gosh, A) you need more tiers and B) you need to charge for it.” ‘Cause I know that you could, I know that you could. With 300,000 free users, you could be a $5 or $10-million business.  Marie Martens:Yeah, we could.  Rob Walling:What is your thinking on that? Are you going to keep this pricing forever or is this something to get ;cause built an incredible brand already, an incredible momentum, and is there a time where you reap that, where you reap what you’ve sown and you do introduce higher price plans or the 29 becomes, even if the 29 becoming a $49 plan, we do the math on that, you almost double the size of the revenue of your business overnight? So tuck me through the thinking there.  Marie Martens:Yeah, it’s a discussion we have. Obviously, we have, you’re not the first one saying that we are leaving a lot of money on the table. I think what has worked for us is keeping things free and simple and only having one pricing tier and the fact that it’s priced that low actually a large part of the success of Tally. Imagine we would introduce higher price plans, then we would also, one of our USPs would be gone and the cost of marketing would increase. So that’s how we look at it. We do feel like more enterprises or larger companies are starting to get interested in Tally and using us, and we’re not fully equipped for that. We don’t have the legal team, we don’t have the compliancy. All of that costs a lot of money as well. So we’re heavily focusing on startups, creators, the smaller businesses where a Jotform, Typeform, especially Typeform, they’re only raising their prices. So they’re moving away, they’re moving up market. We are doing the opposite. So I think for us, as long as we’re small and we remain a small team, it makes sense to not raise our prices. We have talked about introducing more of an enterprise plan, but that would come with more support as well, compliancy, all the things that I’ve mentioned before. And we’re not sure if that’s the road that we want to take as well with Tally, especially because we’re having a lot of fun doing what we’re doing now. So to be discussed, to be honest. it’s not something that we’re planning to change in the near future because we feel like we can grow a lot more with what we’re doing now, but maybe one day. But it’s not something that is on the table right now.  Rob Walling:And that’s the freedom you have as a bootstrapper is you can limit your growth, you don’t have to optimize everything. You can make that choice because the business, the pricing right now is, at least I would argue, it’s not optimal, but you’re making that choice to do that.  Marie Martens:Right.  Rob Walling:You don’t have to go all the way to enterprise. You mentioned enterprise a few times. When I look at your pricing, I think $29 a month, there could be-  Marie Martens:Yeah, enterprise is too far off.  Rob Walling:Yeah, yeah, a 1000, 2000, whatever. But there’s a 49 or a 99 and a 149 and a 200 or whatever, that could then have tiers. I guess my question, so I understand your pricing is, if I were to sign up and I had 20 team members, 50 team members using Tally, and we were getting 10 million form submissions a month and we had a 1000 forms out there, would I pay you $29 a month?  Marie Martens:No, because we have a fair use policy. So basically when you sign up, you also need to agree to the policy and it basically says that when you exceed a normal usage, so when it causes really, when you would have millions of submissions a month, then we basically draft off a custom pricing based on the volume. So it can be very, very high usage or collecting a very large amount of file uploads, things that cost us a lot of money as well. Then you would be on a custom plan, and that can go from hundreds of euros to more depending on the volume.  Rob Walling:Got it. So you do have people, you do have businesses paying you hundreds of dollars?  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Okay. That makes sense.  Marie Martens:It’s a smaller amount. It’s not really where we focus on as well-  Rob Walling:Sure.  Marie Martens:… But we do have some kind policy or fair use policy in place.  Rob Walling:So let’s say, I was paying you $29 a month, and is it when I go over 50,000 form submissions in a month?  Marie Martens:It’s something like that. And if it would need to be consistently, so if it would be like a 100,000 for six months, then we would need to adjust the pricing. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Got it. Yeah, that’s where the money is, that’s where the money is.  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:See, I think there’s a lot of money to be had with that. So 300,000 free users, 4,500 paying. So 1.5% of your free users have become paying customers?  Marie Martens:Yeah, it’s a bit more, but it’s like 1.5% to 2% or something like that. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Okay. I want folks to understand that ’cause again, we launched a free plan at Drip and I think we went to 30,000 or 40,000 free users over the course of while it existed. It doesn’t exist anymore, and I don’t remember if that was a year or 18 months. Getting to 300,000 free users, even just that, is insanely difficult. That is mad props to you for building that engine. And is that pure virality? Is it really once you got to fly with that is what you’ve banked on, you really haven’t done any other marketing?  Marie Martens:No. We’ve built in public, we’ve been active sharing that, but that really doesn’t compare to the impact of the virality of the form.  Rob Walling:So virality has been the key to growth to date, but that will take you so far. Typically, if you’re having the success that you’re having, you’re looking at other marketing approaches, A) so you can diversify, but B) so you can grow faster. What’s next on your list of marketing approaches to attack?  Marie Martens:So this year, we’re looking at two things actually. There’s influencer marketing and there’s SEO. SEO because we’ve, from the start, made some really simple comparison pages, just to try out what it would do. And we do have some that are pretty successful for us, like free Typeform alternative page, forms for Notion, some very specific ones that are getting us more traffic. So we are now investing in, okay, what should our strategy be? Which contents should we create to grow organic, organic search? And then, influencer marketing for me really matches with the positive word of mouth that we have been having by just really engaged, happy users sharing content anyway about Tally and just the idea of how can we amplify that and how can we make sure that there’s more content being made around Tally, especially YouTube is something that is almost unexplored for us, but that can be, I think, a really good acquisition channel, same like TikTok for example. So that’s something that we’re looking at at experimenting with this year. Yeah.  Rob Walling:One thing that we dealt with a lot at Drip because we sent e-mail was we dealt with hackers and we dealt with spammers. It was awful. At your volume, you have to be dealing with spammers. Actually, I was checking you out on Twitter ’cause I wanted to get your Twitter handle and it looks like you’re currently-  Marie Martens:We’re in it.  Rob Walling:… Dealing, as we’re recording this, this will go live in a couple weeks, but you’re currently blocked on Verizon or whatever. And I’ve had all of this happen too. What is that burden like, how are you working around that and what is the experience like dealing with that constant influx.  Marie Martens:It’s the first time that it’s been as bad as this week. So we have abusers coming in all the time. We have to spend a lot of time on detecting phishing, abusive forms. People find all kinds of ways to abuse the product. So that’s definitely a downside of having the free product, but even then, people pay with stolen credit cards and still abuse the system. We have been improving abuse detection, like our systems a lot, but still it requires some manual moderation in the end, which is actually a quite time-intensive job. And since last week, indeed, we have been blocked by several ISPs around the world. We’re trying to figure out why because it’s very difficult to get in touch with them to know what the source is, especially if you’re not a customer. And it’s hard to be a customer with all the providers around the world. So we’re actively trying, asking our users for help. They are also contacting their providers to figure out what’s going on. So yeah, we somehow got flagged or blocked, which makes it impossible for people, some people in the States, people in the Emirates as well to access Tally and yeah, it’s the first time we’re experiencing it on this scale and it’s pretty scary because it’s something that we don’t fully control ourselves. It’s not like we can just introduce an easy fix and it’ll be solved. So yeah, we’re trying to reach out to everyone possible to make it go away or have it fixed as soon as possible. But I think it’s probably one of the most stressful weeks in the history of Tally that we’re in right now.  Rob Walling:I’m sorry to hear that and I know exactly what that feels like where it’s not in your control. Back in my day, I used to be like, this could be it. We could be done here. All of our IPs, sending IPs got blacklisted at one point ’cause of spammers. And I was like, if we can’t send e-mail, what are we doing? And it’s this crazy existential anxiety. So I am sure that’s going through your mind and-  Marie Martens:Yeah, I can relate.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Sorry to hear it. I think as a final question I want to ask, there’s tens of thousands of listeners to this podcast and I think someone listening might be thinking, can I take the learnings from Tally. And I’m going to say some of the learnings are start with free, be really low-cut, like just undercut price undercut, keep it simple, whatever, go into a different market to take it and apply. I want to apply this to compete with Intercom or Salesforce or Zapier or just any market that we could pick. What are your thoughts on when this would work and when it wouldn’t because I don’t think it’s going to work against Salesforce, for example, complex products, blah-blah-blah? Have you given any thought to how replicable your success is to a new entrepreneur or a new space?  Marie Martens:I think it is as long as you manage to build a product that people actually love to use, and I think word love is important in there because our early users are really the people that really value the interface that we created, for example. A lot of people don’t care how it looks, they just want something that works. But I feel like the small group of maybe even a niche of people that really values that user experience is what got us our first users and they were also the most heavy promoters and they have spread the word around. So if you can tap into that small crowd of early adopters to find first users and then afterwards you can scale, I think you can replicate it. I think you can build a very, very simple alternative to an intercom, why not? If it’s cheap, if it’s what people need in the beginning of their, for example, Indie Hacker career, I think it could work, but it needs to be, and I think that’s also a big, big part of our success is, it needs to be built very well and it needs to look good, it needs to be fun to use, and you need to have that virality somehow. So yeah, maybe with an intercom that would be more difficult, but I think the virality is probably the key ingredient. Yeah.  Rob Walling:But I think you’re overlooking something, it’s market size.  Marie Martens:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Form builder, the market size, the number of, I don’t think if I build a cheap competitor, simple competitor to intercom, I wouldn’t get 300,000 free users.  Marie Martens:No.  Rob Walling:I might get 10,000 and so the numbers wouldn’t work. So that’s a factor I think that people would have to think about and should be careful.  Marie Martens:Yeah. Everyone needs a form at one point.  Rob Walling:Everyone. It’s a huge market and that is such an advantage that you have, so if you’re going to enter it-  Marie Martens:Yeah, definitely.  Rob Walling:… It’s got to have, like for you to have 300,000 free users, there are tens of millions of users worldwide, if not hundreds of millions. And how many, that’s a rhetorical question, but how many software markets have that many users? There’s probably electronic signature there. We can think of a few, but there aren’t. I don’t think there are hundreds of markets that are that big. I think there’s tens of markets, so that’s what someone would need. Again, I’m trying to say this to educate folks who are listening to be careful because you can’t just take lessons from your experience and be like, “Oh, I could just apply this anywhere.” It doesn’t work that way.  Marie Martens:Yeah, market size is definitely, yeah, is definitely a big factor in it, for sure. Yeah.  Rob Walling:But I mean your success speaks for itself and it’s super impressive-  Marie Martens:Thank you.  Rob Walling:… To have watched your journey. And when I looked back and I listened to a few interviews in prepping for this, there was an interview from whatever, a year or two ago, and it’s like we have 60,000 free users and then there was one where you said a 100,000 and I expected, when you got on today, that you were going to say some number that was slightly bigger than a 100, but to hear 300,000, I’m just like, “Oh my gosh, it’s going faster. The momentum is building.” So it’s really impressive and it’s been great having you on the show today.  Marie Martens:Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me.  Rob Walling:Folks who want to keep up with you, you are Marie Martens on Twitter, that’s M-A-R-T-E-N-S and of course, Tally.so if they want to check out an amazing form builder.  Marie Martens:Yeah, that’s where you can find us.  Rob Walling:Great. Thanks again for coming on, Marie.  Marie Martens:Thanks so much.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Marie for joining me on the show and thanks to you for listening this and every week.

In this episode, I answer listener questions, some really good listener questions today ranging from how to position against existing incumbents, how to evaluate H1 landing page changes, the impact of a niche tech stack on company valuation and more. I’m actually running low on questions, so if you have a question for the show, you can email at questions@startupsfortherestofus.com or just head to the website, startupsfortherestofus.com. Click Ask a question in the top nav. And of course, as always, audio and video questions go to the top of the stack. I’m planning to have fan favorites back on the show in the coming months to answer questions. Folks like Derrick Reimer, Ruben Gomez, Craig Hewitt, Asia Arangio. So get your questions in if you’d like them to be featured on the show. Oh, and I want to make a request. I get a lot of early-stage questions about idea validation, choosing between side projects. “What should I do? How do I launch?” I would love to hear some later-stage questions. If you have 5K MRR, 50K MRR, 5 million ARR, write in with a question that you are facing. You can remain anonymous. I realize at a certain point what becomes hard is you have a team and you don’t want to write in with a question that could potentially backfire on you that your employees could hear, or there’s a lot of things to be concerned about at that point. So this is an open invite if folks send in later-stage question. And I just mean anything after you have some type of product market fit. Think of the SaaS Playbook stages of like, “Oh, I’ve built something and people are generally paying for it, but I want to grow this. Here are some things I’m facing.” I would love to have those questions and bump them to the top of the stack. Before we dive into the episode, I wanted to let you know that our MicroConf Mastermind program is open for applications. I’ve talked a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my entrepreneurial success, but finding the right founders to join up with can be hard. Over the past few years, our team has successfully hand-matched over 1,000 founders into Mastermind groups by looking at your revenue team size, strengths, goals, and a few other data points to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series, a three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing and more. If you’re looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business, and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your success, you can learn more and apply today at microconfmasterminds.com. Applications are closing soon, so make sure to get your application in by June 12th. Again, that’s microconfmasterminds.com. So with that, let’s dive in to my first question from Mackenzie.  Mackenzie:Hey Rob, this is Mackenzie. I’ve been listening to the show for the last couple months and I really appreciate the content. It’s helped me out a ton. I have a question for you about positioning. I just finished up episode 673, and in it you talked about positioning TinySeed against other VC funds and also how you position Drip against Infusionsoft. And I’m wondering if I’m in a similar situation, especially as the smaller guy punching up at larger incumbent competition, how subtle or how direct should I be with calling out who we’re competing against and how we can do better? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks.  Rob Walling:I really like this question. Thanks for sending it in. The answer is it depends, but I’m going to tell you what it depends on and kind of the decision tree that I personally would go through and went through when I was positioning TinySeed or Drip or HitTail or whatever against a large incumbent. First thing I ask myself is, is mentioning their name going to be helpful? Does everyone else in the industry know that when I say the name of my big competitor that everyone will know who it is? So if you’re competing against Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Intercom, Jira, even Infusionsoft in the right circles, everyone knows who they are and everyone, I will say… I’m saying everyone very generally, but a lot of people know, “Ooh, yeah, there’s some issues with this tool.” So Salesforce, what would be the complaints? Way too expensive, way too complicated, hard to use, hard to get on board. The sales process is not great. I believe it’s annual contracts. There’s all these things you could list. And if you’re going to be the not that, the anti that where you’re going to have monthly plans, you’re going to be easier to use, you’re going to be a lot cheaper, you’re going to basically the zig when there’s zagging and it’s helpful because everyone will recognize the name, then consider mentioning them. Now, I will say this is not legal advice because one thing that you can get into a potential danger point is that obviously it opens you up to a cease and desist of mentioning another company by name. Now, do they have any leg to stand on if you’re being honest and truthful and forthright in your marketing, if you have a comparison page that really does compare the two, honestly? Yeah, they don’t really have a leg to stand on if you’re doing that, but if they send you a C\u0026D and they’re a kajillion dollar company, you don’t have the money to defend from a lawsuit. So usually what happens, I’ve seen a few kind of versus pages get cease and desists. Sometimes I’ve seen founders just change the page, alter it slightly. Other times I’ve seen them take it down because it’s not worth a headache. Knock on wood, I have yet to see one actually go to a full lawsuit because it’s just not worth it, because as everyone knows, in lawsuits, the only people that make the money are the lawyers. So that’s a little side jag there of obviously it’s kind of a warning, right? If you’re going to mention competitors by name, this is a danger. I will admit, knock on wood, I have never had an issue. I’ve never received a cease and desist myself. And I did mention competitors, I mentioned really large competitors that probably just didn’t care. So it was like Infusionsoft, it was Marketo, Pardot, Eloqua, Silverpop. These were big, big companies and I just don’t think they were paying that close of attention. I also didn’t say much about them. I would say, “If you are tired of expensive, clunky solutions that lock you in for an annual contract like…” And I would list them out. So in my opinion, it was not huge, huge risk to do that. However, in your shoes, if no one knows this company name, if mentioning them isn’t going to send them more traffic than the notoriety that you’re getting by mentioning them, then no, of course I wouldn’t. It just doesn’t make sense. You’re only using it. You can be vague is what I’m saying, is you can say, “If you’re familiar with the big gorilla that does this and has all these bad things about it” that I’ve probably already mentioned, but if… You don’t have to name them by name is what I’m saying. All things being equal, I would lean towards naming them if you want to know the truth, but you do have to weigh the pros and cons of potential liability, which again, I think is low, but it’s not legal advice. But I found the more specific you can be about positioning against specific incumbents I think is pretty helpful. So in the end, it’s up to you. It does depend, but those are the factors that I would be thinking about as I made this decision. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. My next question is about evaluating H1 changes on your landing page.  Edward:Hi Rob, I love your podcast and I listen to every episode. I’m Edward and [inaudible 00:08:40] productivity SaaS. I often hear that many startups are changing their H1 on the landing page very often, and I always wondered how are these changes tested. Are these companies and startups, are they running A/B tests or they simply waiting and seeing what happens? I understand it’s also something like changing your positioning and so on, but I would like to hear about how this has actually evaluated these kind of changes. Thanks so much.  Rob Walling:So interesting question. I’m curious what these startups are that are changing their H1 on their landing page very often because that sounds like they don’t know what the (beep) they’re doing. In all honesty, don’t change your H1 often unless you are flailing, things are not working, you don’t have product market fit, your positioning’s off, and then, “Okay, I’m changing it to try to figure out how to drive more trial signups or more customers or whatever.” But once you’ve locked in on something that’s generally working, you don’t change this often because your H1 becomes part of your positioning. And you don’t want to change positioning often because it confuses the market. So I guess that’s my first thing, is if you’re looking at Indie Hackers on Twitter who are launching 12 products to see what sticks and they’re just spinning around changing a bunch of stuff, launch, launch, change, change, they don’t know what they’re doing. So look, I’m not saying I actually like the Indie Hackers website and the podcast and all that. I’m not trying to disparage that, but just when I say Indie Hacker, I do mean the dev who’s launching a bunch of side projects hoping that something works and they tend to not know what they’re doing. So this is where you have to be careful about who you are watching, who you’re observing and who you’re taking guidance or mentorship from. Even if it’s not direct, but you’re taking signals from folks who don’t know what they’re doing, that can be confusing. If you look at companies that have their positioning relatively locked and they are building a great business and they have some semblance of product market fit, like for example, go to tinyseed.com/portfolio and go through 20 of those companies and just for kicks, monitor their H1s and see how often they change. I would be shocked if any one of those 20 companies dramatically change their H1 in a three-month period. It’s just not something that people do that often. Now, with that said, I will say that I’ve done plenty of split tests and there are folks who are especially low touch funnels where it’s high volume and it makes sense that you can actually split test. There are some companies, some SaaS companies that do in fact change their H1 subtly. They don’t change the entire value prop, they don’t change their positioning, but they’re changing wording, phrasing and what have you in the H1 and H2 to see if it drives more people to click through or to sign up for a trial or book a demo. If we’re thinking about those folks, and my answer to your question is, if they have enough traffic, they should be split testing. That’s what I used to do. I split tested probably 10 different products websites where I was split testing the headlines or the messaging or all this stuff, but they were high volume plays. If you’re getting a thousand uniques a month, even 5,000 uniques a month, it’s tough. You just can’t get a lot of signal and a split test takes a really long time. So for folks who don’t have that much traffic, they are probably just winging it and they’re probably taking their best guess and doing what we call a poor person split test, which is where, “Well, how many trials did I get in the last 60 days? How many do I get in the next 60 days?” Close enough. “Is it perfect?” No. “Is it the best you can do if you only have a thousand uniques a month and you’re selling something that’s really expensive so that your end is very low, meaning the number of people coming through your funnel is low?” Pretty much. So I hope that answers your question on three fronts. One, you shouldn’t be changing it super often unless you are actively split testing. Two, split test if you have enough traffic. And three, if you don’t have enough traffic, you can do what I just talked about with the poor person’s split test. So good question, appreciate you sending it in. My next two questions come from Evan.  Evan:Hey, Rob, this is Evan from Seattle. Love the show and have been listening for a few months now. I’ve been fortunate enough to save a year of expenses from working a FAANG job, and I’m about to leave that job to pursue entrepreneurship on my own. I found that my full-time role took too much time and mental energy for me to balance full-time work with the family and also working on a side gig. So I’m doing this without a step 1 business under my belt, but have some scratch my own itch type ideas I’m pretty eager to explore. Two questions for you. First, is there a modern equivalent of identifying a niche based off of the 5K spend for a magazine full page ad? With print falling off, I’ve been thinking of what equivalents there might be. Maybe a subreddit community with X number of subscribers? Second, I’m starting from scratch. And while I’ll be full-time on my solo work, total time is at a premium since I’ll have only about 12 months of runway, I’m debating if I still want to go through step 1 and 2 of the stairstep approach if I don’t have a short-term goal of building enough money to quit my job since I’ll have already quit it. I wonder if that might pivot my approach to only pursue step 1 ideas that could conceivably expand into my entry to standalone SaaS, or if I skip step 1 and 2 altogether and jump in head first and save the extra time, the maybe three to six months I’d have spent on step 1 projects. I don’t think I’d be as passionate about those step 1 projects longer term, but I also want to make sure that I’m being judicious with learnings since this will be new for me. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  Rob Walling:Thanks for those questions, Evan. So with regards to the $5,000 rule of thumb, I think Tim Ferriss had that in for a work week. I think I might’ve quoted him in Start small, Stay Small. I don’t remember. I had some loose rules of them in Start small, Stay Small, obviously 14 years old now, so I don’t know. I don’t necessarily hold up over the test of time as things change. The thing to keep in mind is these are all just rules of thumb. It’s just not a hard and fast rule. It’s just guessing at how many people are interested in a topic. So I actually really like your idea of finding a subreddit with a certain amount of people. And I’d be curious what you think that number is because I’m not familiar enough with Reddit. I mean, I’m on and I click and look around, but I don’t know enough about Reddit to know if a subreddit with 5,000 versus 50,000 versus 500,000 is a big or small one. The other thing to think about is if I’m selling a product for $10 a month versus $1,000 a month, well, you need a lot fewer people. The market doesn’t have to be that large in order to make it work. I do like that idea though of thinking about or seeing a community like a subreddit and looking at the engagement. So I think you’re onto something there. Another couple thoughts that I have is you can use tools like SimilarWeb or Alexa. I’m sure I just activated a bunch of people’s Amazon assistant, but it’s A-L-E-X-A.com. In fact our digital Amazon assistant got its name from this website. And from these sites, look, they’re not perfect, they’re directionally correct, but you can estimate traffic to certain websites. And so you would want to look at larger competitors in this space and realize that, “Oh, if a SaaS application’s getting 10,000 uniques a month, it better be a really high price point. If it’s getting 100,000 uniques a month, if you’re a developer entrepreneur building a lifestyle business, could you build a business on that?” For sure. I built really great lifestyle businesses on much less traffic than that. And if a competitor is getting half a million or a million uniques a month, then you know or you at least have an indication that, “Oh, there’s a lot of traffic here. How can I kind of siphon some of that off?” You can also look at tools. Say again, competitor research like tools like Crunchbase to see funding raised in employee headcount of competitors. Or if you’re going after what I’m calling orthogonal SaaS… All right, so we have vertical SaaS, which goes after a particular niche. This would be accounting software, but it’s designed specifically for freelance web developers or for psychologists. That’s vertical SaaS. Horizontal SaaS is something that any business can use, and that is SavvyCal, which is the best scheduling link on the internet, which any business can use, or SignWell, which is of course the best electronic signature app. That of course is a horizontal play. Orthogonal is where it is raw-based or title-based. So it’s focused on a specific title within a company. So for example, HR software like applicant tracking systems or something that helps you evaluate developers and hire developers which may be targeted at say HR or might be targeted at hiring managers or like software development managers. Those things are aimed at a particular role or a title, and I call that orthogonal SaaS. So with that said, if you’re going to be going into a vertical or orthogonal SaaS, you can look, and you’re in the US, you can look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And so if you look up how many architects there are in the US or you look up how many hairdressers there are or accountants or whatever, that can also give you an idea of, “Oh, there’s 5,000 versus 100,000 of these types of businesses.” And look, if you’re bootstrapping SaaS and you want to get to a million, 3 million, 5 million in ARR, you just don’t need that many. You don’t need that many companies. You’re not building a venture scale business where it’s like, “Well, my total addressable market has to be a kajillion dollars.” It’s like your total reachable market or your term as you’ve been hearing me say on this podcast, it just doesn’t have to be that big if you’re trying to replace an income or build a six or seven figure ARR company. So anyways, those are the kinds of signals that I’d be looking at. And I don’t have hard and fast rules about them, but you get the idea. You can start comparing the data from one niche to another from one role or title to another. And then Evan’s second question was about having 12 months full-time and should he do step 1 and step 2 businesses. Because realistically, step 1 and step 2 are designed to get you out of employment so that you can focus full-time on your entrepreneurial efforts, and he’s already there. So my answer is, I do think this kind of depends. I don’t have a hard and fast rule or strong advice for you on this. What I will say is step 1 and 2 businesses tend generally to be easier to grow quickly and get to 5K a month or 10K a month. Building a full-blown SaaS, it just takes so much longer. All the stuff, it’s just, I won’t rehash the stairstep method here. But a step 3 business, a standalone SaaS, it usually just takes you a lot longer because you’re not injecting yourself into an ecosystem. It takes you a lot longer to iterate. It takes you a lot longer to build and just get the thing out the door because it’s more complex, there’s more functionality and there’s a lot more to it. So that’s the pro and con. In my book, I’d be thinking, “Okay, by 12 months I need X amount of revenue per month coming in, or I need to get a job. What’s the quickest way there?” And I would really be thinking about my, if I have any unique advantages like, “Do I have an audience? Do I have a network? Do I have a unique set? Do I have a unique knowledge of a space?” And it’s okay if you don’t. That just kind of helps. Decision making gets easier when you have some constraints. But for me, I think I’m on board with your idea of, “Hey, maybe I’ll do a step 1 business, but I make sure that it can probably get to whatever my revenue goal is.” Let’s say it’s 10K a month, that’s something you can live on in most cities in the United States anyways. Then maybe using that as a constraint of like, “Well, I’m only going to go after step 1 businesses where I think they can get to that.” I don’t think that’s the worst idea. And in your shoes, I probably would veer more on the step 1, step 2 approach of kind of get something out quickly, get it into a marketplace, see where there’s traction rather than building a standalone SaaS, which as we know just takes a lot longer to iron out all the kinks and to find product market fit. So thanks for the question, Evan. Hope that was helpful. My next question is from Gio about the impact of the tech stack on company valuation.  Gio:Hello, my name is Gio. I love the show. My question is about using more of a niche technology to build your SaaS and how that affects things when it’s time to sell. How might a potential buyer evaluate a company that’s built with more niche technologies that they aren’t as familiar with and that aren’t quite mainstream? So for instance, people usually use JavaScript, Python, Rails, maybe Java and other mainstream technologies to build their product and to build their business. But for example, I’m a closure programmer and we are a niche community. We are very healthy, smart, vibrant community, but we’re not exactly mainstream, although it’s used in many companies, it’s [inaudible 00:21:11] tested, it’s a very robust language. A potential buyer may not be familiar with it. Commonly, they’re not familiar with it, so they might have questions like, “Will I be able to hire for this? Is this a risk, basically? Is this a technology risk?” And while from my perspective, me being familiar with the community, with the language, it is not. And maybe even I would consider it an advantage in a certain sense. From another person’s point of view, from a potential buyer’s point of view that might be a disadvantage. So, provided that the business is actually doing well, might the technology choice of the business impact things when it’s time to sell? I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that both in the context of a micro SaaS as well as a more full-scale SaaS, let’s call it. I was wondering, so how a choice of a niche technology might impact a buyer’s valuation or decision to buy or not to buy? Thank you very much.  Rob Walling:All right. So once again, the answer of course is it depends, but here’s what I don’t do on this podcast. I don’t say it depends and then just waffle and kind of give a generic advice. When I say it depends, I try to then say, “Well, what does it depend on and what are kind of the buckets that it would fall into?” And so in this case, it does depend. It depends on the exit price, I think in general. A rule of thumb, a generally directional thing is that if you are selling an app for under 100,000 dollars or under 250 or some number that’s low six figures, you are likely selling it to a technical individual because at that sale price, there’s not enough money to hire full-time developers. So even like micro private equity or an investor or someone who doesn’t want to day-to-day be in the business is going to be very unlikely to acquire that business. It may even go up to, I’m trying to think, it depends on multiples and all this, but let’s say it’s up to a quarter million, 350,000 or whatever. Oftentimes it’s going to be someone who needs to write the code themselves. And so in that case, I think the tech is going to be very important. And if closure, as you say, is a niche technology, I think it’s going to be a major disadvantage. I think if you are selling in the half a million to, I don’t know what number would this be, 10 million, 20 million, I think it becomes a concern, but it becomes less of a concern because I think your buyers at that point are going to be strategics or private equity and they care more about the business fundamentals. But here’s the thing they’re going to be concerned about. The biggest thing, it’s what you brought up. They’re going to say, “Can we find developers for this tech?” So if it truly is some crazy niche, I know closure is not this crazy niche, but imagine some tech that if I said the name of the stack, I said the name on this podcast, most people don’t know what it is. That would be a problem. Because if a private equity is going to spend 5, 10, $20 million, they want to be able to maintain that. And if they just can’t find people, that’s a problem. So the question here is, how many closure developers are there and is it a growing technology or is it a mature technology that is sunsetting? Because every technology has its lifespan and its lifecycle that it slowly rides over the hump. So if it’s a dying technology and you’re building it now, or it’s not super popular technology and you’re building it now, will it be less popular 2, 3, 5 years down the road when you go to sell, making it even harder to find developers? That would be something I’d be thinking about because I think that’s going to be your big concern at that point. Now, let’s say you’re selling for the sake of argument. I don’t think it’s relevant here, but hey, anything can happen and I wish you the best of luck. Let’s say sell for $100 million or 200 million, a huge, huge nine figure exit. At that point, the tech matters a lot less because think about just saying, “I’m going to spend $100 million on the business.” You’re buying the tech, but really you’re buying a lot more than that. You’re buying the user base and probably the revenue stream and you’re buying the brand and you’re buying the team, and you’re buying all this stuff that’s actually worth more than the tech. Unless you’ve built OpenAI, if you’ve built a CRUD SaaS app, the tech can be rewritten at that point. And there is a certain price point where that just flips, right? And again, I don’t know. It depends on the buyer, it depends on the process, it depends on what you build. It’s all these depends. But at five or 10 million and it’s a small app that can be rewritten in three months, then how much does it matter if it’s in closure? But if it’s super complicated and it’ll take two years to rewrite, that number has to be higher. The exit price has to be a lot higher before someone’s like, “Cool, we’ll buy this and we’ll just rewrite it and migrate everybody over.” So I hope that my thought process there is helpful at kind of these three different exit multiples or exit prices and how they impact it. I want to tell you a little story. I purchased an app called HitTail. It was a SaaS app, SEO long-tail keyword tool. And that’s the one that I grew into the lifestyle business. It was pretty life-changing in terms of making 30 grand a month more money than we’d ever had or ever seen. And that was written in classic ASP. And it was built in ’06, which should have been built in Dot.Net, but it was built in ’06 and I bought it in 2011. Classic ASP. Think about this. Think about this 11-year-old web technology, VBScript. I happened to know it. I had coded ASP for a year back in 2000, and so I was in there fixing bugs and changing things. It was, as I said, a certainly sub $100,000 purchase and I was going to be in the code. If that had been written in closure, I probably wouldn’t have bought it. But with ASP, I got a good deal on it because I knew ASP and not a lot of other people did. So then I grew it to 30 grand a month and I started thinking about selling it. I talked to a few people and no one wanted to buy it. They said classic ASP is a deal breaker at this size. So once Drip started getting going, I hired a couple developers and I had one of them rewrite HitTail in Rails. That instantly made it a much easier sell. Now, I paid a developer, I don’t remember how many months it was to be honest, three months, maybe four months. I paid them as a full-time dev to do it and migrate the data. One day we pointed the DNS and the design look the same. We didn’t have to even have to inform… I think we informed customers there’ll be downtime while we do a switch, but we tried to exactly replicate everything in Rails. And that made the business infinitely more sellable. I did wind up selling it in 2015 as Drip was taking off and I couldn’t focus on multiple things. So for what it’s worth, that’s been my firsthand experience dealing with exactly this question. So thank you for that question, Gio. I hope it was helpful. My last question of the day comes from Riley.  Riley:Hey Rob, my name is Riley. After 15 years as an army doctor, I’ve swapped my stethoscope for the startup scene. I’m a huge fan of your podcast and have turned others on in the SaaS Playbook. So thank you for all the insights. My co-founder and I are launching a freemium platform aimed at tackling the bias, paywalls, and inefficiencies plaguing health and scientific publishing. It’s a space where clinicians and researchers can collaborate peer review and publish globally with premium features for those diving deeper. We’ve got monthly plans starting at $15 a month and higher plans for those who want advanced features. My question is, do you see us as more of a B2C or a specialized content service? Eager to hear your perspective. Thank you as always.  Rob Walling:The way I’d think about this, Riley, is if the clinicians and researchers are going to be paying out of their own pockets using their personal credit card, then yeah, you kind of are selling to consumers. This is a nice to have and it’s coming out of a personal budget. If you are in fact selling site licenses or multi-seat licenses, doesn’t sound like that’s what you’re thinking of, but you’re thinking about selling it to actual clinics or universities or places where researchers work and you’re selling to the actual businesses, well then you need to charge more, and that would then be more of a B2B play. I’m not going to dive too deep into my thoughts around doing freemium. I’m not sure if that’s the right play. I just don’t know this space well enough and I don’t know exactly what you’re doing so it’s hard to say. Maybe freemium is the best play, maybe a free plan, a time-limited free plan or a usage-limited free plan. But if you’re thinking freemium of like, “Oh, you can read up to three articles per month for free, five articles per month, and then it’s paywalled,” it’s fine. I don’t have a major aversion to that in this case. $15 a month is rough, though. That is going to be, you’re going to have some pretty high churn. You can’t afford to market at 15 bucks a month. You can’t afford to do ads. You can’t afford to do anything except for free things. You can’t afford to go to in-person events. You don’t have the money. You don’t have the lifetime value or even the annual contract value to be able to afford to do anything. So that’d be the biggest thing, is it’s like, can you do a bunch of free online marketing and convert people? Freemium alone probably isn’t going to be it. But you know your space a lot better than I do and you know your reach. I don’t know if you have any competitive advantages, you have this massive audience in the space or big network with a bunch of people who are going to promote you. It changes things depending on where you’re starting from. You say you do have higher plans for those who want advanced features. Maybe that said, I would be thinking about selling, certainly having a dual funnel if I was going to do that. Meaning you have the $15 a month plan and then you do have an enterprise Call Us plan where it’s like, “Get a license for a thousand seats of this.” That’s where most of your money in my opinion is going to come from, at least based on looking across my 192 SaaS investments. So thanks for that question, Riley. I hope it was helpful. If you have a question for the podcast, head to startupsfortherestofus.com, click Ask a question in the top nav.

And in this episode, I’m joined by Dr. Sherry Walling, where we have a great conversation, it’s fun. We move from the best uses of the internet. We tell a couple recent stories that have more relevance to us as humans than we talk about, Sherry’s recent circus show and her desire to do that. It’s as much of an entrepreneurial venture as anything is given the amount of time and focus and money and energy it takes to put that on. I asked her why she does it, and I think there’s some lessons to be learned from her journey and what we all do as entrepreneurs. And finally, we talk about our new book, which I say new book, I mean we’re probably still six months out, question mark, from launching it, but it’s a book about selling your company, about thinking through whether to sell it, things that could change, that would make you consider selling it, the mental side of the process, dealing with all the humans involved. We haven’t talked anywhere else about the book in this depth as we do in this episode. Before we dive into the episode, I wanted to let you know that our MicroConf Mastermind Program is open for applications. I’ve talked a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my entrepreneurial success, but finding the right founders to join up with can be hard. Over the past few years, our team has successfully hand-matched over 1,000 founders into mastermind groups by looking at your revenue, team size, strengths, goals, and a few other data points to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series, a three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing, and more. If you’re looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business, and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your success, you can learn more and apply today at microconfmasterminds.com. Applications are only open until July 12th, so make sure you sign up before then. Again, that’s microconfmasterminds.com. With that, let’s dive into our conversation. What’s the difference between a light bulb and a startup founder?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Something about screwing?  Rob Walling:Oh my gosh. Light bulbs stop working when they burn out.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Founders never stop working.  Rob Walling:No. Burnout. [inaudible 00:02:37] I figured is-  Dr. Sherry Walling:I love burnout jokes.  Rob Walling:Isn’t it fun? Is burnout-  Dr. Sherry Walling:My whole life is like a burnout joke.  Rob Walling:Something to joke about. Well, thanks for coming back on the show. Dr. Wallings, great to have you here.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It was a pleasure. Mostly you didn’t have anybody else, so you’re like, “Hey, will you be on my podcast?”  Rob Walling:Did you just say it was a pleasure as if the episode’s down? I just think, “It is a pleasure?” Kind of checked, we’re 48 seconds in-  Dr. Sherry Walling:It was a pleasure to be asked.  Rob Walling:Oh my God, it was a pleasure just to be nominated.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’m happy to be here.  Rob Walling:Oh my goodness, we’re off to an amazing start. Okay, so I want to kick us off. We’re going to dive into all kinds of fun stuff today about motivation, about the exit book we’re talking about, maybe even talk about a circus show. But I want to kick us off with a story from you: the best use of the internet. Tell us this story.  Dr. Sherry Walling:This is a good story related to this aforementioned circus show.  Rob Walling:That you hosted.  Dr. Sherry Walling:That I hosted. So I wrote and produced and starred in…  Rob Walling:Geez.  Dr. Sherry Walling:… sounds very pretentious, a circus show in honor of Mental Health Awareness Month, so using movement art to really depict what I think is a core idea about human flourishing. We’ll talk more about the details later. But anyway, so I’m putting together this show, I’m doing a lot of promotion for the show. Basically everyone I know or is connected to me on social media is probably overhearing about this show. But one of the things that I was doing was looking for visual images to depict the ideas and the characters in the show. And so, of course, like a good tech person, I go to Dall-E and get some cool images that depict this idea of the mind, body, and soul in this certain color scheme that we’re using as characters in the show. I think that’s a perfectly fine way to go. The images are fine, they’re okay. But I got a message from a woman who is a local artist, a tattoo artist and a painter, and also dabbles a bit in circus, so I know her peripherally. She sent me a message and she was like, “Hey, just so you know, a lot of visual artists are really struggling with AI-generated art. We’re triggered by it. It is replacing us. We’re getting a little lost in the story of AI-generated art.” I was like, “I completely understand.” She said, “Basically, you might not know that it might be upsetting to some people in your community that you would use images like this.” And then she said, “I know you’re doing this show, I know it’s really important to you. I wonder if I could help you create some art for it that is really from a thoughtful, soulful, non-artificial intelligent way.” And so we talked about how I don’t really have budget for that line item for the show. We talked about some other ways that I could in kind reciprocate. But anyway, she made this really beautiful art for the show. I actually have it right here. I think it’s really beautiful, really captures the spirit, really colorful. I loved the best of the internet story because she saw that I posted something that bothered her, not deeply made her, but just bothered her, and she doesn’t know me very well, but she took at the time to write me a very thoughtful note, gave me the benefit of the doubt, wasn’t accusing, wasn’t like, “Hey, you’re clearly aligned with the robots and hate all artists.” It didn’t make it this polarizing discussion, but she just spoke her truth about it in a very thoughtful, respectful way and then offered to help, offered this collaborative, kind solution. I know that not every AI-generated piece of art is going to generate that kind of warm human interaction, but I really loved the way that she handled it as opposed to all of the potential ways that could have been much more inflammatory. It also really gave me a space to super celebrate her artwork both on the internet and in 3D, and it was a big poster for the show. So I like the story.  Rob Walling:Yeah, there was some nuance. There’s nuanced thinking of like, “Oh, it’s not all bad or all amazing.” And also it sounds like she came in with a posture of questions, of genuinely seeking to find out your thoughts on it, offering a solution instead of just raising… How many people approach you-  Dr. Sherry Walling:It just wasn’t a rant.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s a rant. How many people approach me about my businesses or stuff I publish or MicroConf, it’s just, oh, problem. “Did you know there’s a problem here? Oh man, there’s a problem here. You should really fix that problem.” And it’s like, “Oh, what are you doing to help fix that problem?” I think as a community, we could all fix that problem. She wasn’t saying, “Oh, you created a problem and you should fix it.” She’s like, “How can I offer to help?” That’s great. I love that story. I have a best use of the internet story as well, not at all related to startups or entrepreneurship at all. But little known fact, I set the record at my high school for the 300 meter intermediate hurdles. I set it back in 1993. I don’t think about that at all. Obviously it was something that I probably should be proud of. It was a great moment. I remember the moment it happened. I remember qualifying for the state meet in California that year, which is hard to do. And I remember breaking the record. But since I left school, I just haven’t thought about it. My track coach from that year pings me every five years or so on Facebook Messenger and says, “You still have the record, no one’s beat it. You still have the record.” So he thinks about it more than I do because he’s involved with it, it’s a point of pride for him. It was his first year of coaching. And so I get this Facebook Messenger message from a guy I went to high school with, and I have not talked to this guy since the day we graduated in 1993. He says, “Someone just broke your record, 31 years.” And he said, “My son runs for our same high school we went to, and is a really good friend of his. I’ve watched this kid go after your record all year, and he just broke it.” He said, “I think there’s a video of it too. I can send it.” I was like, “What?” A, I was like, “Are you trying to scam me out? Do I need to wire you money?” This is so out of the blue. Again, I haven’t thought about this in forever. And so he sends me a video of the race, and this kid, I mean, he’s a seventeen-year-old, he’s junior, he’s way ahead of the rest of the field, just destroying them. My friend said, “It makes me realize actually how much of a badass you actually were.” It was such an odd comment, but it just came out of the blue. He says, “Seeing how dominant this kid is and to know that you were running this in the ’90s, that’s a big deal.” So it impacted me a lot in a way, all positive. I was not upset. I was not sad. I don’t think like, “Oh, my record.” All I thought of was, “Good job, kid. Good job. Super proud of you.”  Dr. Sherry Walling:I love too that you know this kid was gunning for you.  Rob Walling:He was.  Dr. Sherry Walling:You know that he knew the number and he knew that you said it, and he’s like, “I’m going to get Rob Walling’s record.”  Rob Walling:And my name and number, they have all the records, so my friend said, “He was gunning for Rob Walling’s record.” That’s just such a trippy thing because, again, I don’t think about it that way, but he has no idea who I am. I’m wondering if my friend ever told him that he ran track with me. Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t, but I’m just some amorphous person who ran this 39.30 time in the hurdles. So I thought about it-  Dr. Sherry Walling:Until…  Rob Walling:Yeah, until he broke it by three… well, 2500ths of a second. I was really impacted by it in a way. It made me nostalgic, but it also made me super proud of myself for being 18 and doing that. It also made me really, really happy for this kid. Just really happy that he could share in that joy. I don’t need the joy anymore. You know what I mean?  Dr. Sherry Walling:You’ve accomplished some things.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I don’t need the joy of being the record holder. It just doesn’t matter. So I sat down and I recorded a video, a three-minute video on my iPhone, and I said, “Hello,” insert kid’s name here. “My name’s Rob Walling. You probably know…  Dr. Sherry Walling:You know my name.  Rob Walling:“You know my name.” Oh, it was so funny. And I said, “You just broke my record, and I have nothing but incredible respect for you.” And realize the rarefied air, like our school was… It’s a high school, I think it was started in the ’70s, and the record I broke was set in the ’70s. So I was either the second or maybe the third person to hold it. So now you have this kid who’s the third or fourth person to ever hold this record. And it’s fast. He’s either going to beat his own record or I think it’ll be decades again. This is a hard record to beat.  Dr. Sherry Walling:He’s a junior, right?  Rob Walling:He’s a junior, he’s 17.  Dr. Sherry Walling:He is not done yet.  Rob Walling:Crazy. And so I recorded this video, and it was just like, “Mad respect for you. Super impressed. Welcome to the club.” There’s three of us, four of us. Obviously we don’t know each other, but it’s pretty incredible. And then I told him, “I’m pretty old now, it’s been 30 years since I broke that.” And I told him how much track and being an athlete has meant in my life, how much it taught me about hard work and about…  Dr. Sherry Walling:So you gave this kid a three-minute, old guy lesson.  Rob Walling:A little bit. But I tried to be really authentic, like, “This is the rest of your life in the sense that this-  Dr. Sherry Walling:Matters a great deal.  Rob Walling:That’s what I was trying to say, “This matters so much.” I still remember the day I broke it. I still remember the accomplishments that I did in track. Even though I don’t think of them that often, once I do, it’s a big part of my life. So anyways, I sent that to his parents because I had their info, and they showed it to him and he was like, “Whoa, this is crazy.” And then the parents were like, “Oh my gosh.” His dad was like, “You just taught him more in two minutes than… I’m trying to teach him all this stuff, but he’s willing to listen to you because you and he are like the only people that have done it.”  Dr. Sherry Walling:You’re in this special club that I’m not in.  Rob Walling:Just crazy. Anyways, that’s my best use of the internet, because without the internet, I wouldn’t have found out about it. It would’ve been months. I couldn’t have sent him a video. Just so many things coming into play of that is really cool, and I hope this has a big impact on him maybe just for a day, maybe for a week, or maybe, like me, for the rest of most of his life.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I love the impact that it’s had on you, on the sense of connection to that part of you, that 18-year-old version of you. And since this has happened, you’ve gone back and you found the video of the race where you set the record, and we watched it together. You showed it to our son who’s just beginning his track career. I think the ability to connect both with other people that you wouldn’t necessarily interact with, but also to connect with this past version of you feels like quite a gift. Thanks, internet.  Rob Walling:We’ve been partnering with Lemon.io for several years, and they’ve proven to be a great choice when it comes to hiring for a highly skilled developer to work on your project.

That’s lemon.io/startups. So speaking of a past version of you, just a couple short weeks ago, you were hosting, producing, starring… And you sound like Sylvester Stallone, “I wrote the movie because they wouldn’t let me be… I wanted to be the lead.” I mean, this circus show was an event. It was to how many performers, hundreds of attendees, three different performances, a lot of moving parts. Talk us through what it entailed and why you did it. Why do you do something like this that’s hard?  Dr. Sherry Walling:So this is the second circus show that I’ve created. It involves 20 artists, and we had 400 attendees over three shows. One of the shows was a continuing education class for licensed psychologists, marriage, family therapists, social workers living in our state, which in and of itself is quite bizarre that the boards of those different entities have to approve an educational activity like this. So they approved a circus show, which I think is pretty cool. So the shows that I’ve created, both of them, have been an attempt to bring into the 3D, bring into physical artistic expression some deeper observation or truth about human functioning and human flourishing. So it’s a little bit like Cirque du Soleil meets your therapy appointment. So if you could imagine your therapy appointment being acted out by a Cirque du Soleil troupe, that’s our show.  Rob Walling:That’s a heck of a tagline.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I only starred in this one because I needed a couple extra acts and I didn’t have any more budget. So I was like, “I guess I’ll do it.” Truth, actually. But I get to work with these extraordinary performers. I think I love doing this work because so much of my work is so intellectual, it’s word-based, it’s thought-based. It’s doing this, it’s having one-on-one conversation with founders, which are hopefully of deep service to them and very helpful to their ability to lead and flourish and function well. But there’s also a whole part of my life as a human and of all of our lives as a human, which is not cognitive and it’s not word-based. And so if we can find ways to have collective or shared experiences together where we’re engaging a topic or learning something or tackling something but not necessarily with this prefrontal cortex, word-based language, I think that people are pretty hungry for those kinds of experiences. It’s what going to a concert does. It sort of sweeps you out of your mind and into the music and into the shared experience of the music that you’re hearing alongside other people. And so, creating a show is about making collective a set of emotions and a set of ideas.  Rob Walling:And you put a ton of work, time, energy, effort, money into it. What do you get out of it?  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think I get out of it a sense of I’m doing a bit of what I was called to do. I know that’s maybe a weird, maybe philosophical or spiritual way of thinking about things. But many of your audience members may know I lost my dad and my brother in close proximity to each other, so I’ve worked through grief pretty deeply. We have in our lives in the past few years. One of the things that I just have absolutely taken away from those experiences are the fact that words don’t account for everything that’s important and that art and creativity and movement are absolutely essential to human wellbeing. And so, I can talk about that and I write about it and I tell everybody, but to show it and to invite people into an experience of it is a way of having people know something, not just with their minds, but with their cells, with their whole bodies. So that’s just part of my mission in life. So when I do something like this or invest all this time and energy, I feel like I’m following marching orders from whatever, the universe, the divine. I also really love to shine a spotlight on other artists. You and I have accomplished a lot in our lives, and I’ve had a lot of opportunity to be on a stage, I’ve had a lot of opportunity to get my ideas across, but to have the opportunity to really cast the focus on other artists feels extremely satisfying to me. I think that’s part of the second half of life work, which is how do we really spotlight people who have something to show and something to say, in this case, the language of movement. So that feels important and meaningful to me. Also, it’s just a thing I think should exist. I think we should have more deep level, meaningful engagement on meaty topics in the creative ways. So that’s what I’m about.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it sounds like a really nice compliment or in alignment with life’s mission, life’s passion. It’s nice to be able to do something. And that’s where you’re willing to do something hard and invest time, attention, and energy and do something that is mentally and physically and psychologically challenging, but it’s worth it, maybe like playing a sport, being a founder.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah. It also feels in balance. I talk to a lot of founders who spend a lot of time in their heads, and that’s the job, your value is in the functioning of your brain and your creative ideas and the way that you communicate, the way that you see the world. That’s the unique asset that a founder brings to their company. But I think that there’s a vulnerability to get too heady. And so I talk a lot with founders about hobbies, about passion projects, about legacy work, about having a cause or a thing that you think matters and having that be really important in your life. Not to take away from your primary focus on your business, but as a supplement, as a balancing out of the neural circuitry in your brain so that it’s not using the same things over and over, but is diversified in its ability to see and function and problem-solve and feel like you are in the wholeness of yourself. I can’t tell other people to do that if I’m not willing to do it myself.  Rob Walling:I want to mix it up and talk about the book that we’re working on about exits, The Psychology of Exits. I haven’t talked much about it on the podcast. I’ve hinted around about it, but…  Dr. Sherry Walling:Your marketing strategy is like my marketing strategy, which is write a book and then see if people can find it.  Rob Walling:Hey, can you find it based on some… I used a pen name too, so you can’t even use my real name.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s like a scavenger hunt.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s great. No, but I was just looking in the document, and we have 16 chapters and seven chapters have a first draft. We have 27,000 words, which puts us on pace to be exactly a Walling book, which is right around 200, 250 pages. All the books we’ve written have been that. I guess Touching Two Worlds is a little longer. But yeah, I want to give people an idea of what’s in the book. Chapter one is Why Is This So Difficult? Chapter two is When Is It Time To Go? So obviously that’s thinking through things that might change or come into play to have you move on. Chapter three is Exit Options. Four is What Does An Exit involve? Then it’s Walk-Away Mindset, Getting The Deal You Want, Why Do You Need A Support Team, Collateral Damage, Minimizing Negative Impact, Who To Tell When And How. And then that’s only the first eight chapters. The rest is dealing with the process and managing it afterwards, and you have your team and all this and that. So why did we decide to write this book? What’s the need? Why are we good at this? Why do we know what we’re talking about? No, but why does the world need this? You and I both came to this conclusion that the world needs it and that you and I are as good a people as any to write this.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think we’re the perfect people to write this. You know how bad I am at marketing. But I think we are the perfect people to write this because you’ve been through the exit directly. I’ve been through the exit as your partner, so indirectly, but definitely on the bus for all of the roller coaster of emotions up and down and left and right and upside down. Stop with that, with your face.  Rob Walling:It was fine. It was easy and fine, best memories of our life.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So we’ve been through it. And then if we take it a level back, in your work with TinySeed and your work with Discretion, in your work with MicroConf, you’ve been on the periphery/the supportive guiding function, the counseling function for a bunch of exits over time. And in my work with founders, I’ve been on the mindset side like, what’s happening? How do I decide to pursue an exit? How do I get through the exit process? What do I do with myself after an exit? So we know this topic from every layer imaginable. I think it’s extraordinarily important because it is a thing that people get so stuck on so often, but there’s very little language about that. I mean, again, best-case scenario, an exit is phenomenally successful. Someone walks away with a pile of money, everybody’s happy. That founder is often in the midst of a great deal of emptiness and lossness that is very, very difficult to voice. So anyway, exits are way more difficult than people recognize, give them credit for. You and I know that on all the levels of possibility, and I think I have some really interesting ideas about what to do about that and how to make it strategically preventable to have some kind of… You don’t have to have an implosion around your exit.  Rob Walling:Yeah. I remember a couple of years ago on this podcast, it was probably three or four years ago, I said, “Look, an exit, you might only do it once, especially if it’s a seven or eight-figure exit. You might only do it once in your life, and so if you’re at a point where you feel like spending 30 minutes talking to someone who has some experience, knowledge, and advice to give on this, ping me directly and I’ll talk to you.” So I talked to, I don’t remember, 15, 20 founders over the course of six months all at different stage. I mean, some of the exits were, “Oh, I’m at sale for 750K.” Other people were like, “There’s a $10 million offer on the table.” All of this is life-changing, and some of it is never-have-to-work-again money. What I realized through those conversations, and you’ve had a lot more and more in depth than I have had, those obviously aren’t the only ones I’ve had, but I just remember it being a very compressed time, I got to see that, “Oh, there’s a lot of commonalities.” I started saying about 60, 75% of the same things over and over, where I was like, “Oh, you’re in… ” There’s a lot of commonality. And that was when I realized, “Oh, someone should write a book that talks about this side of it.” I told them a little bit of like, “Oh, you should get an M\u0026A advisor or a broker, a great one, a great SaaS one is run by Intervals at Discretion Capital, but there are others out there, certainly quite light and a fee and all that we talk about, but M\u0026A advisor. But then there’s mechanics of it of like, “Ooh, I think about it this way.” But then there was a lot of the mental side of it, of just thinking through, “How do I think through? How am I going to deal with this when I’m in the middle of it? How will I deal with it at the end?” And there are other books on this topic, right? We know Dan Andrews… Is it Before the Exit, After the Exit? I forget which one it is, but After the Exit. John Warlow’s written three books on this stuff. But we have more to say. In fact, we talk about all those books in the book, like they’ll be in an appendix of like, “Hey, here’s further reading,” but we have our own additions to make and our unique takes and our unique advice. I really feel like there is a gap in the market for this type of book. Look, it’s not going to focus just on SaaS or on tech companies. We obviously have a lot of experience with that in the network, but you also know folks who have tried to move out of agencies, service businesses, even trapeze schools or circus stuff. There’s still real businesses that you can sell. Just because they’re not SaaS doesn’t mean that we won’t include them. And hopefully, what we have to say… I think what we have to say is really pretty valuable.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’ll be interesting to see how the book reads because you’ve got two people with different expertise and different ways of thinking and different voices. We’re trying to weave it together to feel seamless, but I think your deep procedural knowledge about exits and your just ways of thinking in decision criteria, to sell or not to sell, you think about, “Okay, if I’m making this much at this point and this much ever this time… ” You make it like a word problem, like a math equation. I just approach that question very differently. I think both are really, really relevant and both are important. So if we nail it, which I have some hope that we will, I think the fullness of the perspective will really, really be an asset to people who are reading it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think about it as a spreadsheet. You think about it as an intuition or there’s a lot of heart and mind going into it. I think about it as an escape room, solving a puzzle.  Dr. Sherry Walling:You think about an escape room, I think of it maybe as an existential philosopher.  Rob Walling:Totally.  Dr. Sherry Walling:What’s the meaning behind this?  Rob Walling:And that’s what I hope we can bring to this, is there’s a bit about mechanics, a tiny bit, but that’s already been covered in other books, how do you think it through? Here’s the thing, if there’s any criticism someone can give me about The SaaS Playbook or Start Small, Stay Small, any criticism that I will accept because it’s how I write, is it’s like dense. It tends to be succinct, terse. I give maybe an example here or there, but it’s not filled with a bunch of anecdotes about stuff. And, one could think it might be a little dry. I feel like, “Look, I’m very practical about things.” It’s informational, right? Yours is certainly informational, but from a different perspective. I think you drive a lot of, “Oh, here’s a story. Here’s an example. And here’s,” like you said, “an existential question,” rather than, “Are you doing math in your head, or are you really thinking about all the people involved?”  Dr. Sherry Walling:Ultimately, exits are both, right?  Rob Walling:Yep.  Dr. Sherry Walling:They are a math problem of what numbers make sense and they are like, “What is the nature of what is important in my life?” kind of problem. So that’s where, again, I get really excited about this book. I think other people have talked about aspects of that, but probably not with the fullness with which we’ll tackle it.  Rob Walling:So I’m excited about it. We have about three quarters of it mapped out really well and obviously half of it written, so hopefully coming, I don’t know, later this year.  Dr. Sherry Walling:What are we launching this book?  Rob Walling:Don’t know yet, but I do-  Dr. Sherry Walling:My chief of staff was asking me, “Well, what’s your timeline on this?” I’m like…  Rob Walling:“Yeah, writing this summer, try to get it done.”  Dr. Sherry Walling:Because you have a few other things that you’re launching.  Rob Walling:I have another book.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So we’ve got to launch all our things. I also am going to do a deeply revised update of The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Keeping our (censored) Together. Well, we are.  Rob Walling:Totally. I think it could use it, right? I mean, that’s a six-year-old book. It’s held up well, but we have so many more stories, anecdotes, and thoughts. When I read through it now I’m like, “Oh, this is cool. It’s a little light.” I have a lot more to say.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, I have so much more depth now.  Rob Walling:And then, of course, The SaaS Launchpad, which is my precursor to The SaaS Playbook, the early-stage stuff, that book, I keep saying it’s written, but now as I go back and read it, I’m like, “Ooh, this is like 80% of the way.” I need to rewrite a lot of pieces, and I think… Not a lot, but I need to rewrite some pieces. I’m doing a video course through MicroConf called The SaaS Launchpad. I think that’s going to be the next thing I launch. SaaS Launchpad itself as a book I think is behind The Exit Playbook, depending on timeline.  Dr. Sherry Walling:In terms of launch timeline?  Rob Walling:Yeah, I could see SaaS Launchpad being next year.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I do love how you/we are going to be able to speak to the whole life cycle of SaaS business. There’s the launchpad, which is like, “So you’re thinking about making a SaaS company.” Then there’s The SaaS Playbook, which is like, “Here’s what you’re going to do.” And then there’s The Exit Book, which is like, “Here’s how you wrap it up nicely, take your bucket of money and go.” And then The Entrepreneur’s Guide will help you not lose your sanity or your family while you’re doing said books one through three.  Rob Walling:I’ll tell you what, they have the Star Wars trilogy, right? They have the Unholy trilogy, which is Kevin Smith’s… Was it Clerk, Mallrats, and Dogma I think? Or maybe it’s Clerk, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy. And we are… What is this? A quadrilogy now?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Quad, yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Unless you wanted to be a trilogy, and then The Entrepreneur’s Guide is like Silmarillion.  Rob Walling:It’s the lore.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Here’s what’s really going on in your head.  Rob Walling:Oh, boy. It’s the deep lore. If you want to read Elvin or Elvish, whatever-  Dr. Sherry Walling:No, don’t say that. It’s very, very approachable.  Rob Walling:Oh, boy.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah. I’ve never, obviously, relaunched a book before. I want to do it that way to retain the title. There’s a lot of reasons to do it. Because it’s not a totally new book, but I’m aiming for 30 to 40% new, which is a chunk. So if you’ve purchased it before, please consider purchasing it again.  Rob Walling:Oh, yeah. We will make it so it’s worthwhile. And we’ll re-read the audiobook because the audiobook quality is so-so.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, and we’re going to do it together, right?  Rob Walling:I mean, I don’t know. That could be interesting. We’ll have a lot of off-the-cuff moments, arguments caught on tape.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Remember that big fight we had in chapter four?  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s great. Let’s talk about this. Boy, let’s relive some… While we’re at, give me some paper cuts and pour lemon juice on them. This would be great.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I’m curious, maybe people in your audience know, are there audiobooks that are co-written or co-read by the two co-authors? Because we’re co-writing two books and…  Rob Walling:Yeah, I have heard some. So if you’re listening to this and you’ve heard it done well, please let me know. I’ve heard some where it’s basically the two authors trade-off chapters. They don’t actually read it together. I can see why that’s the case, because reading it takes a long time, and who wants to sit and stare at each other through an audio or a recording app for that long? But if you’re interested in any of these books, then be sure to go to robwalling.com, enter your email there. I don’t email very often, but that is the hub where all my book stuff comes out. And while you’re at it, head to zenfounder.com to get Sherry’s weekly newsletter, about twice a month, founder mental health and… No, it’s just the right amount.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s not too much.  Rob Walling:With that, I know that you have to run off to a track meet. I have to take someone to the airport. We are heading on our way. Ready, Break?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Go team.  Rob Walling:So thank you again so much for joining me today. Folks who want to follow you on Twitter, you are @sherrywalling. And any other place you want them to go to find out more about what you’re doing?  Dr. Sherry Walling:I mean, if you are on Instagram, my Instagram’s pretty cool because it’s a cool mix of entrepreneurship and circus. Who doesn’t love that? So that’s @dr.sherrywalling.  Rob Walling:Thanks again for joining me.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, my pleasure. 27 years in.  Rob Walling:27 years.

Maybe it’s a launch deadline, a date that you have to submit a manuscript by or push your code to production, launch anything and realized, “I thought that was next week.” That’s actually tomorrow. Well, that’s the situation I found myself in late yesterday when I realized that I thought I recorded an extra week of Startups For the Rest of Us, but it turns out I owe an episode to my editor this week. I’m Rob Walling, the host of Startups For the Rest of Us, and this episode is being recorded with a handheld microphone. It’s the same microphone I use at home, but I threw it in my suitcase and hoped that it would work when plugged into my iPad, which is usually what I travel with. And I’m currently recording from a hotel room in San Diego, California at the TinySeed batch 14 kickoff. This is our kickoff for our America’s batch and things get started in just a few hours, but the show must go on. I ship an episode of Startups For the Rest of Us 52 weeks a year and have since 2010. Before we dive into the episode, I wanted to let you know that our MicroConf Mastermind program is open for applications. I’ve talked a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my entrepreneurial success. But finding the right founders to join up with can be hard. Over the past few years, our team has successfully hand matched over 1000 founders into mastermind groups by looking at your revenue, team size, strengths, goals, and a few other data points to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series, a three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing, and more. If you’ve looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business, and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your success, you can learn more and apply today at microconfmasterminds.com. Applications are only open until June 12th, so make sure you sign up before then. Again that’s microconfmasterminds.com.Today, I’m going to answer a few listener questions. I may get into a couple solo topics that I’ve been thinking about as well. My first question is from a listener who asked to remain anonymous, and the question to paraphrase was, “I’m thinking about acquiring a competitor. What should I expect and how should I transition the customers?” My first question was how many customers are there and how much revenue is there? Because the thing with acquisitions is there is a cognitive load. There is a legal load. There is a transitional load. There is an adoption and absorption load. There’s a lot of work into getting it done. So if you’re going to acquire a competitor doing a couple of thousand dollars a month, I’d really question if it’s worth it. Even if let’s say it was free and their competitor is going to shut down, and they literally were to say, “I’m just going to give you all the assets of this business,” I would still have to think about it. Now, it might be worth it. I would evaluate how many customers, where am I at, this and that, but the opportunity cost or the time investment to learn their systems, to talk to their customers, to transition them, that alone is a big deal. This is why you’ll sometimes see really large companies, they need to make big acquisitions in order for it to make a difference for them. And this is why you see really large companies, when they acquire really small companies, they just shut them down. They’re acquiring them for the talent, for the people, for the developers, for the product people, for the marketers, for the team itself. And trying to merge that tech into their business, it just isn’t worth it. You have to buy something at a massive scale when you are at massive scale. So that’s the first thing that I’d be asking myself in an acquisition like this. Is it even worth doing? Let’s say for the sake of argument that you are doing millions a year as a SaaS entrepreneur and you find someone who is doing low to mid six figures a year and they are willing to sell to you at a price that makes sense. Maybe it’s an all cash deal. Maybe there’s a seller note that you pay off over time. Maybe you pay them in some equity from your company. There are all types of creative ways to structure this, but let’s say it makes sense. There’s two questions this listener asks, what to expect and how to transition the customers. What to expect is that it’s going to be a ton of work and that you’re going to want the support of the seller to try to transition those customers. I’m assuming it’s implied in the question that you are not just going to run two separate applications, that your competitor has their own code base, their own app, their own interface, their own login, their own billing, and you have yours. So the first question is do you want to combine those or do you want to become a two-product company? Imagine if you acquired a competitor that did most of the same things that you do and you just ran both products. That would be quite a mess actually. There’d be a lot of effort managing its marketing, its sales, its support. You duplicate. You have all this duplicated effort. So at that point, I’d be thinking about, okay, how do I transition their customers into our product? I would really be looking for a recommendation from the seller on how to do that. I mean, I have my own ideas. Of course, you communicate with the existing customers and you say, “This product has been acquired and we have most of the same functionality. We’d like to migrate you over.” Now, as I’m saying this, I’m realizing that if you’re going to do a deal like this, you may want to make, if possible, parts of the sale price, part of the multiple in essence, contingent on how many folks migrate over, what percentage of customers. Because could we think of a range that’s 30% up to 80%? It’s a wide range, but there’s probably a bell curve of this of the most common percentages that will literally sign up for a new app, create a new login, get their team onboarded if they have multi-seat accounts. There’s all types of things to think about. Can I see it being low as a third of your customers, meaning that you lose two-third of the acquirer’s customers? Possibly. And can I see it being as high as, like I said, 70, 80% where you only lose 20%? Maybe. I mean, that feels very high, but it’s a pretty wide berth there. So that’s an interesting thought is there’s a pretty big range, and should you bank on it being 50% right in the middle? I don’t know. You could certainly run numbers at different, your best, worst, and in-between case to see what it might wind up. The other thing you could do is ask people to migrate, and even if they don’t, you keep the acquired app running. You don’t shut it down, but you don’t market it. You basically shut down signups, and the public marketing site, all that would redirect over to your application, the one that you have in the millions of ARR, and you just kind of let the revenue, the MRR of the old one, just churn out over time. Even with pretty low churn, you will get down to the point of only having that customer base be 20, 30, 40% of its original size within a couple of years. So that’s another way to think about it. Is it like a melting ice cube and you’re just trying to keep it from melting? You’re trying to take the revenue from those who don’t want to switch and you’re trying to take the customers who do want to switch and get them onboarded on your new application. But you can see, it’s pretty technical. It’s pretty complicated. It depends a lot on the apps, right? Let’s say it’s something relatively simple. I’ll put this in quotes, “simple,” and maybe not simple but an app that has low switching costs is probably a better way to think about it. Let’s think of an app like a scheduling link. Even if you have integrations set up, it’s not a ton of work, relatively speaking, to move from one scheduling app to another versus moving your CRM, if you have a team of five or 10 salespeople and you have all this data or moving marketing automation or email marketing platforms. Ton of work. You have workflows. You have subscribers. You have all that stuff. So there’s a bit of it depends in here, but I think what to expect is it’s going to be more work than you think, so make sure that it’s worth it. Make sure that it’s worth the effort, not only the money. Depending on the purchase price, the money can be secondary to the time and the opportunity costs that you have to invest in order to make a successful transition. My next question is about startups that require HIPAA and other compliance. This is from August of last year, so what are we looking at? Maybe nine months? That gives you an idea of how far back we are on text questions. Question comes from Paul Frieden and Paul asks, “Hey, rob, I’ve been watching your YouTube videos for a while. Thanks for the great content. I’ve been working on an idea and I have what I think is a pretty solid MVP. Unfortunately, the idea probably requires HIPAA compliance to sell to many or most of the potential customers. I’m afraid to even start trying to get customers on the MVP without compliance. Even getting an answer on if I can sell and to whom would require expensive legal advice. Any tips? I’m a solo developer, no business entity and totally pre-revenue.” I was on board with this question until that last sentence. Even getting an answer on if I can sell and to whom would require expensive legal advice, it’s an interesting phrasing. Is expensive a thousand dollars or $10,000 and do you have a thousand or $10,000? That’s really the question. I guess without knowing it, I have a tough time if I can sell. I have to talk to a lawyer before I know if I can sell this SaaS is just a puzzling statement to me, so I’m not sure that I can comment on that, other than how much is it going to cost and do you have that money because if you don’t, this is all a moot point. Now, to whom you can sell, I think is an interesting question for a lawyer. But really, the thing is if you think it needs a HIPAA, it probably requires HIPAA, then get it HIPAA-compliant. HIPAA compliance is not out of the realm of bootstrappers. Now, if you want SOC 2 compliance, that becomes pretty pricey pretty quick. HIPAA compliance is different. Of course, this is not legal nor HIPAA advice that I’m giving you, but I have known many bootstrappers, even folks who were on tight budgets who read the HIPAA guidelines and became compliant. It is something that one can do. So if I were to build an MVP and then be HIPAA-compliant, you can do it. Right? It’s possible. The thing to think about is if you’re HIPAA-compliant, you need to charge a lot of money for this. I’ve seen SaaS startups that are charging… Let’s make up some numbers. $20 for the cheapest plan, then a 50 and then a hundred dollar plan. And then the HIPAA-compliant plan is $500 a month or a thousand dollars a month. It means it’s that much more. Those are the price points minimum that I’d be thinking about. And frankly, if you’re going to be doing cold outreach, let’s talk a minimum of a thousand dollars a month or $2,000 a month. These are the numbers that I would be thinking about to make it worth it. The big question I have is not can I get HIPAA-compliant? The big question I have is, does anyone need this? Can I solve a problem people are willing to pay for and can I reach them at a scale and will they pay the price that I’m asking to make it worth my while? For more information on becoming HIPAA-compliant, sign up for MicroConf Connect. I’m sure there’s a compliance channel or there’s got to be a channel that focuses on something like this and just ask, who here is HIPAA-compliant and what process did you use? What documents did you use? Did you just Google Search? There are ways to find this. I mean, I would go to Google or ChatGPT. Even though ChatGPT hallucinates things, I would not use it as the final arbiter, but I would use it as a guideline to get me started to understand what I might need in place to accomplish this. Thanks for your question, Paul. I hope that was helpful. My next topic is not a question, but it’s something that I started thinking about when I heard someone else on a podcast talking about TAM, total addressable market. This is a term that venture capitalists throw around and they are concerned about having billion or decabillion dollar total addressable markets, meaning the entire market of what everyone is spending on the software in this category is billions or tens of billions. This is dangerous for bootstrappers to think about. I’m going to use a phrase and I want you to hear me, bottom up versus top down. TAM, total addressable market, is top down. It’s coming from the MBA at Harvard saying, “Well, we could capture 30, 50, 80% of an entire market, and then it’s worth decabillion dollars. That’s top down. When you are bootstrapping or mostly bootstrapping, I think in terms of bottom up, so I call that term, total reachable market, TRM. The reason I call it bottom up is you’re not looking at a huge survey from Gartner and doing math where you’re kind of just guessing the worldwide value of GDP of some small country. You are saying what is the search volume for this term each month, the total search volume? What do I think that I can reach if I owned most of the Google searches for these terms, realizing that you won’t own most of them from the start. But if I own most of the Google searches, if I rank number one in Capterra and G2, if I owned, so to speak, all of the answers on Quora or Stack Overflow or Reddit or wherever this is being talked about, what would the reachable market be assuming that I am going to be doing online marketing? If you’re going to be doing offline marketing, we have to get a little hand-wavy. Offline meaning are you going to in-person events? I don’t mean buying billboards and radio ads, but that’s what I would be thinking about. When I go through all the marketing purchase in The SaaS Playbook, I would be asking myself which one, two, or three of these do I think will work best or will I start with and what’s my guess? What’s my estimate of how many people are in these channels? Let’s say, I can own a chunk 40, 50% of each of these two or three channels over the next six months, what is the TRM of that? What is the reachable market that I can feasibly reach as a bootstrapped or mostly bootstrapped software company? It’s hand-wavy and it’s guesstimaty, but it’s something. It’s not TAM. TAM does you no good. I was actually asked this. I’m remembering now where this came from. I was asked this on a podcast and I was answering it and they were saying, how do you look at TAM of TinySeed companies? And I said, “We kind of do, but we kind of don’t because look, if a TinySeed company can get to $5 million ARR and they can sell for $30 million or $50 million, that’s a great win for us and it’s a home run for that founder. It’s life-changing.” So how big does the TAM have to be to get to 5 million in ARR? I mean, you could feasibly have a $10 million market and if you get to half of it, you’re $5 million, and with a $50 million market, you only need 10% of the entire market. So that’s where TAM just doesn’t translate to bootstrappers in the way that you might think. It’s not that it doesn’t impact it at all, but I feel like it’s an unhelpful number. It’s an unhelpful way to think about it. In addition to the ways I just talked about with the bottom up of trying to guesstimate how many people might be seeing different things, the other way to think about it is in terms of your category of the tool that you are building. So if you’re building scheduling links or email service provider or electronic signature app, what do you think is the switching volume and the new entrants that are coming into the space for this type of tool in a given month? The switching volume would be those switching from competitors and the new entrants would be people brand new. They need e-signature. It’s like, “Oh, it’s a brand new realtor just getting set up. It’s a brand new whatever, a psychologist or a new startup, and they need electronic signature,” versus how many people are switching away? What is the churn, if you think about it, from a bunch of your competitors? Right? Again, if they’re public competitors, you can take guesses at this. If they’re not, you can still take guesses at it. But I asked this from the MicroConf stage. I was giving an example of a very small market that TinySeed invested in, where there are a total of about 1500 total customers in the US, which is where this company focuses. And I asked the audience, I said, “How many people in a given month do you think are switching from an old existing tool or maybe our new entrants in the space?” And the funny part was the founder of that company was in the room and he held up three fingers. He said three. Approximately, he was giving me about the right number. Now, is it exactly three every month? Of course not, but you get the idea. In a market that small, it is literally a handful of people that are in that most aware category that are ready to buy. If we turn to let’s say email marketing software, could it be 3000 or 30,000? I don’t know, 30,000 feels high to me, but could it be 3000 or 5,000 in a given month? Sure. That are kind of poking around? 10,000? There’s some number. It’s not a million. There are not a million people or businesses in a given month that are looking for a new email service provider, either from switching or from starting a new company. Right? We won’t get within 10%, but we can get within a hundred percent. We can get within an order of magnitude of these things. That’s what I’m talking about with TRM is it’s this total reachable market. Just how many people in general are switching? And then let’s think about how we can get in front of them and that can give us an idea as founders and as marketers and as folks who are trying to add customers, it gives us some type of sanity check so that we’re not expecting, “Oh, I’m going to get a thousand new customers a month,” when there’s probably, in a lot of markets, only hundreds who are really ready to buy and switching from other tools in any given month. So TRM, not TAM folks. Should I get a shirt that says that? No, that would be a terrible idea. No one would get it, and even if you got it, you’d be like, “This is dumb.” So TRM not TAM, I will say it, but no T-shirts, please. My next question is from an anonymous asker who says, “Hey, Rob, I have the product idea and I know the market, but I’m not a developer. I came across your podcast and I’m really learning a lot, even though I only have a vague understanding of what you’re talking about at times. I see the opportunity to disrupt a multi-billion dollar industry. Where should I look for a developer who can help bring my product to life?” I have a couple thoughts here. I think if you’re looking for a developer to work just for equity, don’t do that. It just rarely, rarely works because developers have built up a skill set that allows them to charge a lot of money per hour, and having an idea and knowing the market isn’t enough. It’s just not that valuable. As weird as that says, the idea plus knowing the market is not that valuable. Now, if you have concrete marketing skills and sales skills and you know directly how to reach the market and you have 10 people lined up to consume the software, to buy the software, to try the MVP that you’re going to have built, that’s something. Still not a business, but at least it’s something. It’s some type of validation. If you have an email list with 500 or a thousand people who are super interested in this and you’ve been marketing and pounding the pavement and talking about this idea and the value prop, that’s something. It’s a lot more than having an idea and knowing a market. A lot of people have an idea and know a market. On the flip side though, if you are looking to pay a developer, this is a challenge actually because I can tell you to go to Lemon.io or DevSquad. These are sponsors of this podcast and they have developers that you can hire. The thing is most developers don’t know how to build products. They know how to write code, and much like if you were to go to build a house and all you hired was a carpenter, you’re not going to get a very good house because really, you need an electrician and you need an architect and you need a carpenter and you need someone to… There’s HVAC. There’s all these different trades that go together and collaborate to build a house. With a software product like SaaS, as complicated and as many moving parts as there are, in most cases, you need multiple people involved. It is very rare and we call them full-stack developers. I’ve also heard them called unicorns frequently because they kind of don’t exist. Of course, they exist. I’ve worked with them. Derrick Reimer is a full-stack developer, can build it soup to nuts, top to bottom, but you’re not going to be able to hire Derrick Reimer. That’s the thing. You’re not going to find it. Derrick Reimer is not on the open market. He has his own company. And back in the day when he was young and thinking about starting up, he was working with me and I brought him in as a co-founder of Drip. That’s the level of person that a full-stack developer… That’s what they can command. So it’s that thing of if you go to Lemon.io or DevSquad or Trustshoring or anyone where you go to hire developers, just getting a developer, they can write code. They can build screens. They can build web pages that do things. But who’s going to tell them how to build it? Because you can say, “I want to solve this particular problem,” but there’s a translation layer there in terms of the UX, the design, the product, how it functions, how it can be intuitive, and how the flow should work. What’s the onboarding like? What’s the login like? There’s all this stuff that is not taught in college when you get a CS degree, or if you read a book about programming, this stuff is not taught. Not only that, but it is just very hard to build a SaaS without a technical co-founder. I know that I have some quote, unquote, “rules or rules of thumb,” on this show where I talk about don’t do B2C, don’t do two-sided marketplaces, and I’m pretty serious about those. 98% of the time, you shouldn’t, 99%, almost a hundred percent. This thing I’m about to say is not in that camp. It’s not a 99%, but maybe it’s an 80% don’t do is don’t start a SaaS without a technical co-founder. The reason that I say that is most of the companies that I see, the bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped companies, I’m specifically talking about bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped. If you raised $5 million, you can totally hire a CTO level person or a director of product and engineering who can write code, hire people. You can build a staff out. But if you are the bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped like I’m guessing you are if you listen to this podcast, the vast majority of folks I see trying to do this without a technical co-founder really struggle. The vast majority, I would say it’s 80 or 90%, struggle with the tech side, and their biggest headache the whole time is that they’re able to market and sell, and the product doesn’t keep up. The product doesn’t scale. They need to rewrite their code base every… I know of a technical co-founder who rewrote their code base three times. I know of others who’ve rewritten them twice. It’s just the constant struggle of that. This is across TinySeed, MicroConf, and just everybody I know who does it. I believe across TinySeed, the percentage of companies that we have funded that do not have a technical co-founder are… I think it’s around 15%. I know it’s between 10 and 20, but I think 15 is about where it stands. Again, I’m not saying don’t do it because that’s a pretty big number, and if we’re funding them at TinySeed, then they are obviously having some traction. But I will say several of the folks that we have funded there, they do definitely struggle with just the engineering side of things and the product and the scaling, and it sucks to not have a founder level person owning the fundamental part of your business. This is like me starting, I don’t know, a toy company and I don’t know anything about toys. I don’t know how to make toys. I don’t know how to design toys. I don’t know how to source or manufacture toys. I can start to learn it and I can ask people and I can hire people, but are they going to give me the best advice? Here’s the other thing. With SaaS, building software is like building a building a little bit, in that you get the foundation in and you start building rooms, and that (beep) is hard to change. Versus if I was starting a toy company, the advantage I would have is that if a manufacturer doesn’t work out, I could start over with a new one. It would be a restart, but switching cost is… It’s just the thing. With SaaS or with software, you have legacy code. You have code that nobody wants to spend the time to learn or fix, so they just want to rewrite it, or it doesn’t scale and everything’s buggy and every time we push a new thing, there’s bugs and that doesn’t go away. Right? That is really hard to fix once you’re in that spot. So I guess what I’m advising this question asker is, I mean, you kind of need enough resources in my opinion to find a co-founder who’d be willing to go in on it with you. And if you have a co-founder who is really up on the idea and you’re both willing to put time in nights and weekends, that’s one thing. But don’t send the co-founder off to build for six months nights and weekends while you don’t do anything. You should spend hour for hour. Whatever they are doing, you should be selling, marketing, learning the market, doing SEO, learning pay-per-click ads, doing outreach, building a launch list. I joke a little bit with the hour for hour, but that’s what it should be. Why should they go spend six months nights and then weekends while you’re waiting for the product to be done? Realistically, the best way to do this is to have funds. It’s to have the money to bring a co-founder level person on. Look, even if they only have 10 or 15 or 20% of the company and they’re called a founding engineer or they’re called a co-founder, with the expectation that they are in it to own the code base and to own the quality of that, but you have the funds to pay them a salary, to pay them what they’re worth, so to speak, that’s the way to get a sustainable relationship or to build a sustainable startup in these early days. The other way is to do it yourself, right? It’s to learn to code. That’s what so many of the folks who are bootstrapping, I say, on Twitter, in MicroConf for making it to TinySeed, so many of the folks do put in just sweat equity because they have that skill or they develop the skill or they do no code and they build stuff and scrap their way to making it work. But if you really do want a technical person and you’re not technical, that’s fine. It’s just know how you’re going to go about it because the bootstrap startups that I see crash and burn pretty hard. There’s a chunk of them that have this weird expectation that a developer who can bill $150 an hour consulting is going to work hundreds and hundreds of hours for free for you, for equity in something that is really unlikely to work. Right? Because most startups and even most bootstrap startups just don’t get to product market fit. So that’s a big risk that you’re putting on someone to basically say, “I want you to risk tens of thousands of dollars in in-person hours, in order to maybe build this thing that you might own 50% of.” So with all that said, I mean, if you’re looking for a developer, that’s what MicroConf is. It’s a community of developer entrepreneurs, and some of them are looking for marketing/sales co-founders, but you have to bring the thunder and you have to bring a skill set. And if you bring an idea and you know the market that you’re a subject matter expert, that’s not enough. Thanks for that question anonymous. I hope my thoughts were helpful. My last question of the day is from Jacob. The subject is SaaS app store spending. Jacob says, “I’m reading two of your books, Start Small, Stay Small and The SaaS Playbook.” Those are two good books to read, I think. Start Small, Stay Small, feels like it’s marketing for developers and it’s mindset stuff, and then some outdated advice on doing keyword research, but it really pushes market and marketing over product, which I think a lot of devs need to hear. And then The SaaS Playbook is much more modern take, all the knowledge that I have today about building, launching, and growing a bootstrap SaaS company. So thanks for reading those. Thanks for buying them. Jacob says, “One question comes to mind. Is there public information somewhere on revenue and spending on different app stores, as in which marketplace has users that are most likely to buy the non-free version?” As an example, it would be very useful when choosing to either make, for example, a Slack app or a Jira app. Good question, Jacob. The answer is no. There is no public data I know of. The only thing that you could potentially look at is if the company is public. I know that Shopify, for example, is public. I know that Atlassian who makes Jira is public. I know that Salesforce that owns Slack is public. So you can go to their public filings, S-1, I think is what it is, where they post revenue, where it comes from and all that stuff, and look for it. What I don’t know is if they break it out. Sometimes they just have an item that says other revenue and they bucket a bunch of stuff into it. There is certainly not going to be an easy Google-able Excel spreadsheet of all the app stores. We actually have a list of 71, I think, over on the MicroConf website, 70 or 71 of these app stores that I talk about. When you’re going to build a step one or a step two business, think about building it in an existing ecosystem, so that you don’t have to learn all the stuff at once. And then step three of course is building a standalone SaaS. But we have a list of those. I’m guessing, what? Five of them maybe are public. 10, 15? I mean, it’s not a huge number. I would go to their filings. Oh, another one is HubSpot. Right? HubSpot is public. Rackspace is public, and I think doesn’t Rackspace own Heroku? So you could look at the Heroku market space. Again, it’s going to be some research. There’s no magic formula. There’s no hrefs for organic search just like this cheat code, it’s a tool. There is no hrefs that I know of for this purpose, so I think you’re going to have to do some digging, and that’s okay because if you’re digging, it means other people aren’t and it means there may be a moat around the knowledge that you learn and establish. But no, there is no single source, easy source of the data that you’re looking for, but I do like the way that you’re thinking about it, so thanks for that question. I hope that was helpful.

As always, I’m your host Rob Walling, and in this episode, Arvid Kahl joins me to talk about our five key takeaways from MicroConf US 2024 that happened just a couple days ago as of this recording in Atlanta, Georgia. It was a great event and I don’t just say that as someone who ran and organized it. The feedback, the positivity, the energy, I tell you, it brought me back raring to go, ready to get stuff done. My guess is as you listen to this conversation between Arvid and I, that you will feel some serious FOMO and you probably should because the event was, it was that good. If you know me, you know that I have a tough time talking up the things that I do too much, but this really, really was a special event, so you don’t want to miss future events. Head to microconf.com, sign up for the email list. We have another flagship event happening in Dubrovnik here in October of ’24, and then next spring, probably April we will have another US event and you won’t want to miss it. And with that, let’s dive into our key takeaways from MicroConf 2024. Arvid, thanks for coming back on Startups For the Rest of Us.  Arvid Kahl:An absolute pleasure now that I’m awake.  Rob Walling:I am trucked. Punch drunk was the expression I use. So we are two over-caffeinated, very tired geeks home from MicroConf Atlanta.  Arvid Kahl:That’s right.  Rob Walling:And I believe this was our… I was trying to figure out, I think this actually was our 10th US event. Because we started in 2011 and we skipped two for COVID. So I think that’s how it works out. I actually, I’m too tired to do the math right now and I think this is going to be a great episode y’all. I’m so punchy and then I think it’s our 24th if you include the Europe flagship events, which I do. So coming up on, I mean it’s a lot of events. There were 218 attendees from 15 different countries and the shocking stat was, I think, it was like, what, 75% had revenue, but that 28% of the attendees had more than a 100K of MRR. That was really-  Arvid Kahl:That is crazy.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Arvid Kahl:You just look to your left, you look to your right and statistically one of these people is just making millions a year just from their business. That is bizarre, but equally awesome. Where do you ever get that? That’s crazy.  Rob Walling:I know. It’s crazy and that’s why being in the MicroConf room is just unlike any other room I’m in throughout the year. It was a good crew this year. How many MicroConfs have you been to?  Arvid Kahl:This is my, or has been my third. The first one was in Dubrovnik, the European one just before the world changed forever. And then last year, Denver and this one, my third. I talked to so many people and asked them what their number was and anything above 12 was like, “I forget.” People were just there for 20 some and they just stopped counting because they didn’t care. It’s really great.  Rob Walling:Yep. Patrick McKenzie’s like that, he’s been to a lot of them. Mike Tabor, Brennan Dunn, he didn’t make it this year, but he is got to be approaching 20 MicroConfs. And I don’t know, that’s a testament to the specialness of that room, I think.  Arvid Kahl:For sure.  Rob Walling:So we are going to do our top five moments, our top five, it’s not takeaways necessarily, it’s just the top five things.  Arvid Kahl:That’s right. Even that is not specific. That’s too specific. Top five vibes, I don’t even know. There’s just something there.  Rob Walling:Five things we thought about before we jumped on the mic. So as the guest, do you want to kick us off with your first one?  Arvid Kahl:Oh, thanks so much. I’m going to do something slightly boring and pick a talk. But I’m not going to pick it because necessarily of the talk itself, but more like what it did to the room and that’s by Dr. Sherry Walling, your wife’s wonderful talk on motivation. I mean as somebody who really cares about mental health in entrepreneurship and all that stuff, I care about this. I talk to a lot of people about this and I read a lot about it and all that. That was my talk to begin with. I really wanted to be there for that. That’s kind of what I came for to hear just how we deal with things, where things come from. And, man, what this talk did, people in the room and we were seated around these little round tables, groups of four, groups of six just by default, which was great. You could just start talking to the neighbors on your table and stuff and it was so incredibly interesting when we talked about where our motivation is sourced from. Sherry kind of gave us these seven different archetypes of where motivation for founders comes from and once we talked about it, I realized that everybody has their own little story. I knew it before, but that kind of calcified it. It was like this guy really has to fight against people telling them they can’t do it right. This guy really has to make sure that they show their parents or they show their friends that entrepreneurship is something they can do. And here I’m sitting, I’ve always been super supported by everyone, so my motivation is something completely different. Turn to the next guy, they do it for the money next guy. They do it because they love building a product. It’s so crazy to think that we all are so differently motivated, yet we all have the same dream and we all are on the same path. That was such a cool both dividing and unifying thing that Sherry did by allowing us to explore this with each other. I really love this and you have to be there to experience this. I think you can kind of experience it probably from the recording of it, but in the room right there in that moment was like, okay, I’ve learned something here that I did not expect to learn and I did. It was really cool.  Rob Walling:It’s one of my favorite talks that she’s ever given, this one about motivation. I love how she broke down motivation into micro and macro. And micro is the day to day, hey, I’m going to cold plunge or I’m going to crank Eye of the Tiger. She threw me under the bus on that one and said-  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, she sure did.  Rob Walling:“I hear Eye of the Tiger playing in Rob’s office at times,” but Smells like Teen Spirit, whatever. There’s punk music. That’s the micro stuff of day to day, how you say mode about macro. She had, like you said, seven archetypes. And I loved that as she went through them, I remember she obviously showed me the talk before she gave it and I was like, “Oh, I’m those two.” It was just really obvious to me. And then she said, “And what were you 10 years ago?” And I was like, “Oh, I was these other two different,” it changed over time.  Arvid Kahl:That is really cool. We did that in our group as well and we all had a story attached to that change. For me, it was selling the business. Now all of a sudden money’s maybe not that important anymore. What came and replaced it, something I didn’t expect, was being a people person, that kind of stuff. It’s so cool to have terms to put it into just something that you can actually internalize instead of just having it wishy washy around it. It was really cool.  Rob Walling:And it’s concrete and the moment I saw the slides, I was like, this needs to be a chapter and whether we redo the Entrepreneur’s Guide to Keeping Your ShTogether and update it and add this, or if it goes in another book, there’s just no reason that framework should not be in a book. So my number one was the last talk of the event. It was from Steven Steers. His talk was about sales scripts and about how having a script when you’re doing demos and refining that over time not only helps you essentially build an SOP, a standard operating procedure, but it helps you yourself improve even if you’re going to do the sales for six months or a year. He had almost an entire script memorized. At the end, there was a Q\u0026A of someone saying, “Well, how would you do this part of it?” And he just recited it and you could tell he just recited it. He had memorized it was super impressive.  Arvid Kahl:It was absolutely incredible. The Q\u0026A was like, he had it ready. Every single thing you threw at him, he had a picture perfect eloquently phrased thing he gave you, for free, that you could then immediately use. That was so awesome. I really enjoyed it too. And the fact that he dropped off his book as well. You could just grab a book and read all of these things later at home. That was so, so cool. That was a great talk. It was very polished, let’s just say that. I think it was more than the talk. Again, I guess that maybe a theme. It wasn’t just the talk, it was way more than that.  Rob Walling:And he has a book that is either, I mean we had physical copies at the event, so that was great. But it’s called Superpower Storytelling: A Tactical Guide to Telling the Stories You Need to Lead, Sell and Inspire by Steven Steers. So that was definitely one of my highlights. Oftentimes the sales we usually have… We try to have a talk about sales. It is a very common thing in the MicroConf community, and usually those are, I’m not a salesperson and I tend to find co-founders who do sales or I build businesses that don’t need sales or whatever. But I was just really impressed with that talk and I think I liked Steven’s delivery and I liked the information that came with it.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, there was a lot of sales-centric stuff that people really wanted to know more about. You could feel it from the audience, you could feel when people ask questions, they had things just queued up for an expert to help them with. People they have to sell and I mean, I don’t want to generalize it, but I don’t like it either. I have to because everybody has to. So you have these issues that are always kind at the forefront of just your mind at this point. So having somebody on stage, both with him and the attendee talk that was just couple hours prior to that, was also about sales conversations. So it was a pretty strong theme during the conference just to be open and talk about sales, which was nice because you kind of have to.  Rob Walling:How about you? What’s your number two?  Arvid Kahl:My number two was something that happened on stage as kind of a life event as well. It was the life valuation of a business by the folks over at Quiet Light. It’s really cool to see people who deal with M\u0026A all day, all week, just really tear into in the best way possible a business and the numbers that it presents. It was really fun. The founder went on stage. They had prior given all of their, I guess stripe metrics or something to the Quiet Light folks and they just looked into the numbers, they asked questions about the business, the market and all that. It was super interesting because you could feel how in your own mind as a founder, even just listening to a question coming from an M\u0026A professional make you think about, hmm, this is something I don’t know. Or this is something that I should really optimize because if that’s something they ask, I should have an answer and I should have a good one. So it was really cool and I talked to the founder that was on stage after the conference when we had our last reception there, and I asked him, “Well, do you want to sell now? Do you want to keep it? What do you think about it?” And that started another conversation just really about, well, how much work goes into this business? Is this something that I have to sell to get where I want to go next? Or is this something that I actually have to keep to get where I want to go next? So it was just such an interesting thing to do this live and then have access to everybody involved that also made it very, very special event. It wasn’t rehearsed or anything, it just happened and you could really see how the founder was thinking about stuff, how he made logical connections between things. And I think this is something, it’s just an example of something super helpful for MicroConf because everybody has their own questions, but they all are going in the same direction. That was really cool. Really love that.  Rob Walling:This is the second time we’ve done that. And I was, dubious is not the right word, but I was like, is this going to be entertaining? Is this going to be engaging? And I always think about that if we’re going to put someone either in a workshop or on the main stage. Both times, it’s been both of those things I just named where I’m like, oh, this is fascinating. And every business is different. And you hear the thought process. Like the one MicroConf Europe in Lisbon, I believe it was country specific, their SaaS was. And so it was in Danish for example. And so he’s like, “Here’s how that’s going to count against you.” And it’s like, oh, of course. I kind of thought about that. But he actually was able to almost put a number to that of this is going to probably lower your multiple a little bit, blah, blah, blah. Here’s all the factors. And at the end he’s like, “I think you’ll get between,” whatever the number was, “four and six X or five and whatever X. Therefore your valuation is about this. And if I would’ve really peg it, I would list it at this price.” And I was like, “That is so cool.” And they’re experts. They’re just such experts.  Arvid Kahl:And you can feel that the kind of tacit knowledge that they have that they probably can’t even codify because it’s tacit, because it’s something really internal that is implied that comes out. It comes out in these little moments and then you get it that you get to be there in the moment when it happens, when it comes up, when it clicks for them and for you at the same time. That’s just life and workshop. That is where this comes from. I think you can’t do this if you’re not doing it in front of an audience. It’s really fun.  Rob Walling:So my number two were the micro excursions. And here’s the thing, I didn’t even go on the micro excursions. I actually took the time to kind of decompress and just have an hour or two to myself. But the reason that I like that we started doing these is because it really does follow this through line of MicroConf slightly pivoting away from, oh, it’s a bunch of education, it’s nine talks in two days, eight talks in two days. To where it’s like there’s four or five main stage talks, there’s some attendee talks, there’s workshops, blah. But it’s really about relationships. It’s about the founders being able to connect with one another. And that’s what the micro excursions, they’re just an excuse to go do adult big wheeling with each other, to bake biscuits, to do graffiti. I mean, fowling was the other one where you take a football and you throw it at bowling pins. It’s not the activities, it’s that you’re doing it with founders. You’re like, “Oh, hey, I kind of know you. I recognize you from Twitter.” Let’s have a conversation while we’re throwing a ball at some random thing of bowling pins.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, that’s what I did the fowling. And it was really funny because in the beginning you could see all these founders, they weren’t really sure, do we want to play this? Do we just want to chat? Do we want to have a beer? But then people started playing that. People started playing ping pong. It was billiards. People just hung out outside in the sun because it was a beautiful day in Atlanta, so it was probably the best day for this of all the days that we had. And you could see little groups of people were just chatting about something, other groups were just enjoying the game. It was so flexible in particular, and you could have a nice drink with it. It was a really cool atmosphere, I got to say. And that just opens up communication as well. You’re not stuck in some meeting room or something, you’re in a place with beer. So it’s not the alcohol that does it, but it’s the atmosphere of the place. That was pretty cool.  Rob Walling:For sure. What’s your number three?  Arvid Kahl:It kind of is very much related to this, and I think all of these are obviously related the same event. But to me it’s the hallway track outside the venue and that includes the excursions, but it’s so much more. The excursion is kind of the organized, getting people together and having them do stuff with each other, which is really nice. But it happened organically through Slack, through the MicroConf Connect Slack and through private messages on Twitter and all that stuff, people were going for coffee in the morning before the conference started. We literally did a 15 minute walk or something to a coffee shop that was supposedly very good and then turned out to be actually quite good. We were having dinners with each other. Almost everybody went out with a group of people for dinners and had a chat late into the night, which is not necessarily smart, but it was a lot of fun. People did morning runs, they just gathered to run. They did bible readings in the morning. There was so much going on where people just organically and intentionally willingly congregated and just kind of let their lives intersect beyond just a professional thing. Just be together, talk about whatever they wanted to talk about. And that created a very diversity of people, people at different stages of their journey, people with very diverse, different backgrounds. I personally met my customers there. I met listeners of the podcast there. I met my heroes there. I met my peers. I met so many different kinds of people from all walks of life. The conference, what you said, the educational stuff that is really cerebrally, interesting. But emotionally, relationally interesting is everything else. And it never stops. You get on the elevator, some other MicroConf person is in there and you start chatting, you cannot stop. It’s really, really cool. It’s quite exhausting, but it’s awesome.  Rob Walling:So my number three is basically the same. Mine is nothing beats being in a room, which is what you’re saying, it’s the hallway track. It’s being in a room with other individuals to where you can just have these lingering conversations and then some person floats into it and someone floats out and so the conversation changes. You learn about their business. To your point of people getting together for coffee and dinner, I saw a comment on Twitter, I fly in tomorrow, meaning Sunday, which is the event starts Sunday evening with the reception. And he said, “I didn’t realize so many people would be getting there on Saturday.” And it’s like, I don’t know. I don’t know if it was the majority, but it was a lot of people. I mean a lot of people got into on purpose.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, that’s right.  Rob Walling:To get in there. How many conferences do you show up a full 24 hours, 36 hours before? Not many. But you know that the MicroConfers are going to be there and that you can do the coffee and you can do the dinner. The other thing, I just want to tack onto this while we’re on it, I loved the FOMO that I was hearing of people who have been to MicroConfs and they’re like, “I’m not going to go this year.” I mean the FOMO was deep. It was both on Twitter, it was in the TinySeed Slack. And I could see people like, “I so regret not going.” And I’m like, “Here’s the law. If you don’t go to a MicroConf, there’s going to be FOMO. You’re going to regret it.” So just don’t not go to MicroConfs. That’s the deal.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, I think this year in particular, but I think it’s just getting better and better over time. Not just the conference, but also the communication around it. It just a very organic, honest sharing of what people enjoy. You don’t force it. I mean obviously on stage you tell people, “Here’s our hashtag if you want to use it and all that.” But that’s more like a cosmetic thing than anything else. People just take photos of their friends, like selfies with the people they like and they share it. They talk about the things they learned. It becoming just a normal thing to talk about it. And obviously that induces FOMO in people who would’ve kind of maybe come at this point. It’s nice, I really enjoyed it. Also, one thing I noticed now that you said it coming on Saturday, I arrived on Saturday as well like so many others and didn’t even make it to the hotel counter before somebody talked to me. I didn’t even check in the hotel before I had my first MicroConf related chat. This is how present people were at that point.  Rob Walling:Yeah, something similar happened to me. And as you said, every time I got on an elevator, I’d be like, all right, now I’m going to chill. “Oh, hey, you have a MicroConf badge on. We haven’t met yet.” It was cool. We didn’t quite take over the hotel, but it felt like a little bit. We’ve been partnering with Lemon.io for several years and they’ve proven to be a great choice when it comes to hiring for a highly skilled developer to work on your project.

And I’m going to start with a little story here I guess because the elevator is where this happened. I was just taking the elevator down. It was on the 21st floor down to the lobby because it was the middle of the day or whatever. And there was a woman that was not there for MicroConf for something else, and she was like, “Hey, so what is MicroConf? Because I’ve been seeing so many people and they’re all so nice, they’re all so friendly, they’re all so happy. What are you guys doing?” It was like some professional, some surgeon or something, and she was like, “What cool conference is this where people are so much enjoying their presence and then being together?” So I explained it to her and she’s like, “Oh yeah, I guess it’s a very tight-knit community of very friendly people.” And that’s kind of what I think. It’s this flat hierarchy between people. I can talk to you, anybody can talk to you. Somebody who’s done it four years is super successful and you just treat them like a peer, because they are. Everybody is a peer and we treat each other just like that. There’s no hierarchy. There’s no kings and queens in here. If you walk up to somebody, you have a chat. No matter if they make millions or nothing, it really doesn’t matter. That is so liberating. Because you can just have a chat. You don’t need to queue up or hope for a good introduction or whatever. Nobody is really pitching their stuff on you. Nobody is trying to recruit you or anything. It’s just people who are there for the same purpose. And that is the flat hierarchy is something that I have never, anywhere else, seen to this degree. In other conferences, you have a lot of stars and then they run away. Here, the speakers actually stay for the conference. Asia was around the whole time and she was just commenting on stuff and just talking to people whenever there was a coffee break. Where do you get this? MicroConf.  Rob Walling:That is dead on and it’s something that we did by accident the first year in 2011. And everybody stayed because we had Heaton Shaw, we had Andrew Warner, we had Ramit Sethi, we had a bunch of people and they did just that. They mingled. There was only a hundred of us. It was a small event and everyone was commenting on that. And so we said, “Oh, from now on, let’s invite…” We don’t force our speakers, but we invite them. “Hey, it would be great if you could be around, interact.” And for the most part, most of them do. There’s certain folks I think we’ll get to on our number five who zipped in and out, but he has a lot going on, you might say. Yeah. That’s always been a hallmark, I think, of MicroConf and something I really enjoy about it. On the MicroConf team, we actually had a new team member start just like three or four weeks ago. And so this was her first opportunity to, aside from being in Connect to meet MicroConf people, MicroConf community members in the flesh. And the first day she said, “Wow, everyone’s so nice and supportive and they want to help each other genuinely, and they’re offering advice and they’re asking for it.” And I was like, “Yeah, what did you expect?” And she’s like, “Well, some business events you go to, everyone’s grumpy and everyone’s kind of mean to each other. Or they’re trying to sell each other or they’re trying to put the other down or show how they’re better or whatever.” And she’s like, “That’s just not happening here.” And I guess I take it for granted, it was surprising to me. I was like, “Well, what is the other option?” And it’s like, oh, I guess that people are mean to each other. That just wouldn’t… Look, I wouldn’t run the event if that was… I run MicroConf because it’s an event that I want to attend and if people are going to be mean, I don’t want to attend that event. All right, so my number four is Liana Patch’s talk. It was about her copywriting swipe file, and she went through a bunch of very specific examples of how you can make subtle changes to copy, whether it’s the we-we problem, you don’t say we on your website, you should say a lot of you and talk about your customer. There were just a bunch of really tactful, helpful rules that could be applied pretty much to any website, anyone, whether you’re selling SaaS or whether it’s our MicroConf TinySeed website. I started thinking, oh, how often do we make these mistakes? So very highly rated talk. And of course Liana Patch is amazing. She’s funny and smart and a great copywriter. She’s written a bunch of copy for us. And I did a show of hands in the room, who here has hired Liana to write copy? And a lot of hands went up. So I really enjoyed her talk.  Arvid Kahl:So that was great. And again, it’s examples. This is a workshop. It was effectively a workshop disguised as a talk and also disguised as a comedy routine. So all of this together is just so amazing. Yeah. I hope one day to be one of the people raising their hands as well. It feels like she just has it figured out. So it was very noticeable how helpful this was to people and I really enjoyed it too.  Rob Walling:Here we get to our number five. We almost should do five down to one because this for me is my number one, the moment for me of the event. And I think we share it. So why don’t you lead into it?  Arvid Kahl:I mean, it is hard to lead into something that you have been working on for a good decade or so, but the fact that Ben Chestnut finally graced the community with his presence on stage and immediately was the most likable person in the room. That was incredible. I have many words to describe the moment, anywhere from awesome to adorable. I know. But he had such a presence and he was one of us that was so unexpected from somebody who sells a business for billions. You don’t necessarily expect that he is just like everybody else in this room. But within seconds he had people’s attention and trust and it was a wonderful conversation to see you have with him as is kind of finally, finally this happened after so many years. Please do explain the story of this and the history of that.  Rob Walling:So Ben Chestnut is the co-founder of MailChimp, and they started it in 2000, 2001, and they sold it in 2021, so just about two decades. And they sold it for $12 billion. It’s considered by all measures, the most successful bootstrap startup of all time by both revenue and exit. So I started emailing Ben back in, I was trying to remember the year. I bet it was 2012 to get him to come to the second MicroConf. I don’t know that I thought about it in 2011. I guess I could just search email. And he was always very gracious. And here’s the thing, the first time I emailed him, I’m like, “Hey Ben, you probably don’t know who I am, but I run this event for self-funded startups, bootstrap startups.” And he’s like, “Oh yeah. Hey Rob, you blog at softwarebyrob.com. I used to read your blog and a couple other bootstraps.” And it just showed me how small the community was in the early days. He read it. He was saying from like ’05 to 2010 or whatever, which I stopped blogging after that. But it was really neat that he responded every year that I asked him and very gracious. And sometimes it was like, “Oh, I might be able to make it pencil me in, but don’t announce me.” And then, “I forgot it’s my birthday that weekend or something’s come up with MailChimp.” He’s running this company that by 2021 is 1,200 employees and sending, I believe it was sending a billion emails a day. What an incredible business. Anyways, I continued to email him every year and he would politely decline or whatever. And then eventually we did do a MicroConf local and we brought it to Atlanta because that’s where he lives. And I said, “I want to get you on the MicroConf stage,” the locals, there was like 30, 40 people, but let’s just have a chat. And the first time I met him, I was like, “Oh, you’re one of us?” A lot of us are kind of accidental entrepreneurs. We want to be entrepreneurs. But he and his co-founder just built a thing and then people started paying him and then they’re like, “Well, we’re getting too many checks, so let’s try to figure out how to charge credit cards, and then should we charge a subscription for this?” Because there was no SaaS, this is ’01. And he was engaging and he was respectful of everybody in the audience. He had been in the shoes of all of us. And that’s the thing is, as you’re saying, he’s a billionaire several times over, but you didn’t feel that on stage.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, I do wonder about this because you got to interview him. Did you feel like starstruck in a way? Like a little bit.  Rob Walling:Yes. But I try to get that out of the way before I interview them. So he and I have had a couple conversations to where I’m like, “Oh my gosh, I need to act super professional here because I run Micro…” But I’m also like, “Oh boy, this is a big deal that I’m talking to him.” Same thing happened. I talked to Jason Fried on stage. I talked to Patrick Collison and John Collison. And as I said at MicroConf, those four make up my Mount Rushmore of, I’ll say, bootstrappers. Obviously the Collison brothers with Stripe raised money, but really their ethos is that it’s that practical, pragmatic charge for things and be that way. So yes, I always feel a little starstruck, but I frankly feel that way even with some of my friends now. They’re friends that I respect so much that I’m like, you execute. So yeah, when we were up on stage, that wasn’t on my mind. It was more like, how do I make this interview amazing? And here’s the thing, you could ask the same questions that I asked of 10 entrepreneurs and nine of them would’ve just had so-so answers and just every one of Ben’s answers were intelligent, funny. We’re going to have a video of it. I assume we’re selling the videos after the event, but it’s for sure one of my highlights of the entire conference.  Arvid Kahl:I did not expect to have something so relatable in that conversation, but it was on every single level. And it was really, really cool. And I also liked you were a competitor to him. That was a fun part when you talked about how Drip, you asked if it was even on their radar at all, and even that sparked a really, really gracious and kind exchange.  Rob Walling:The one where he called me a bastard for starting a competitor to him? He’s like, “This bastard, I thought we were friends. This bastard…” Like that. And people just ate it up. I was like, yeah. Those are facts. What you’re saying is a complete fact. I was like, were we a nat or a rounding error? I was going to get to the point of did you spend more on toilet paper than Drip’s entire ARR? But I didn’t want to derail the conversation.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah. You got to keep it on a professional level. I get it. It was a lot of fun. Yeah, that was great. That was a wonderful moment. And hey, for somebody who’s never, ever anywhere, even just gracing us with an hour or so of his time, that was great for the community and it was great for everybody who was there and who gets to watch it, so it’s perfect.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I was very grateful because as you said, he just doesn’t necessarily like the limelight. He doesn’t really do podcast interviews. He’s done a hand… Not even a handful over the years. And he doesn’t travel really for interviews. Because he doesn’t need to, he can do what he wants. So that… Yeah, it really [inaudible 00:29:37].  Arvid Kahl:Isn’t that a lifestyle business?  Rob Walling:For real. Talk about the ultimate lifestyle business, where for the rest of my life and my kids’ lives and their kids’ lives, we could do what they want. Pretty amazing.  Arvid Kahl:It was a great conference, man. You’re doing a great job at hosting these and making these happen. I really appreciate it. Always fun. I cannot see myself skipping any one of them anymore, so there you go.  Rob Walling:Thanks, man. It means a lot. I really appreciate you coming back each year and for spreading the word. Like you spread the word on Twitter on your podcast, and 100% that helps. Because we can’t, with MicroConf, I can’t go run Facebook ads and Instagram ads and sell tickets to it because you have to know. You have to know. Why would I spend a thousand, $1,200 whatever tickets for? Why would you spend that much money on an event? Because you have to know it’s really, really good, and people trust you and other attendees when they say it is unlike any other event that you will attend,  Arvid Kahl:Well, thank you. And then they come to the event and then they notice that they’re actually supposed to be there. That was something, and you said this, and I think Rand Fishkin said it too, the people in this room, they belong here. The people that come to MicroConf, they are founders, and even if you’re just an wantrepreneur or whatever you want to call it, the fact that you’re making the leap to go into this community to learn from people, you don’t need to raise VC. You don’t need to do whatever other people tell you to do. Just be around the people that are aligned with you and you will learn from them and you belong in that room. You made that absolutely clear. And I talked to people after you said this and after the whole event, and they felt like this was the right choice, like coming here, I’ve put this off for years. I thought I wasn’t ready. But then they came there, talked to two guys and half of or one of them would say, “I’m also not ready, but I’m still here.” So it’s really taking the step is the step you need to take in that regard.  Rob Walling:That’s right. I’m glad you brought that part up because I’ve been starting to become pretty deliberate about it because I realize the amount of imposter syndrome that I think a lot of us feel. And if you’re in the room at MicroConf, you belong in the room at MicroConf. That’s the tautology.  Arvid Kahl:It’s a good one.  Rob Walling:That was fun. I tell you, if you’re listening to this, if you saw the tweets, if you experienced FOMO while we were doing it, don’t miss out on the next one. There’s one in October in Dubrovnik, and then one next probably April ish again, back here in the States, we haven’t signed final document, so I don’t want to announce a location, but show up. I have never had someone tell me they regretted attending a MicroConf. And I’ve never even, whether in surveys or whether anonymously, maybe someone wouldn’t tell me to my face. But it’s just something that, and I’ve never regretted, which sounds weird. It’s like, well, aren’t you the host? You’re running it. You have to attend. It’s like technically, I guess, but I go because it’s the event that I want to attend every six months.  Arvid Kahl:Yeah, if you do something for 10 years straight or 12, I guess, and you still love it, that’s kind of an indicator.  Rob Walling:It’s like this podcast and MicroConf I did as a hobby on the side while I was doing everything else. So that tells you something. I didn’t have to do any of the either of those things. The podcast and the event.  Arvid Kahl:That’s right.  Rob Walling:Arvid Kahl, you are a scholar and a gentleman. Thanks so much for waking up. It’s not even that early, it’s just we’re conferenced out. It’s the extrovert hangover.  Arvid Kahl:That’s right.  Rob Walling:If folks want to keep up with you. You are @ArvidKahl on Twitter, you are the Bootstrappedfounder.com, and what do you doing these days? You have your Zero to Sold book folks can check out. Anything else that you’re… Oh, Podscan.fm. Of course, I am a paying customer of Podscan.fm. How can I forget? So you want to tell folks just elevator pitch, what does Podscan do?  Arvid Kahl:So as a media monitoring, alerting, it’s Google alerts for podcasts. You have a key phrase or a word or a name or whatever you want to see, if people mention it, that’s what Podscan does, sends you notification. Also exists as an API. So if you’re a founder who wants to get every podcast out there and get all the transcripts, because I transcribed millions of these behind the scenes and you want to use it for your own products, API exists as well. But thanks for mentioning it. I met customers of Podscan. I met people who are interested in Podscan at the conference as well. Didn’t pitch, didn’t have to. People just came up to me and talked about it and it was so much fun. Yeah, MicroConf has all the layers.

Today, I’m going to look at a couple of the predictions that I made three or four months ago. Just revisit them because I feel like we’re a third of the way through the year and I had a few thoughts on them. And I also want to give you an update on my situation. I’ve talked over the past really nine months, maybe a year, about how I was experiencing some burnout last spring, and then it hit me really hard in the fall. I want to revisit that and also give you a general update on the inside baseball of my world, Startups for the Rest of Us, MicroConf, TinySeed, maybe my books, SaaS Playbook, and the new ones I’m working on if there’s time. So this is definitely an inside baseball episode. I know some folks love these and other folks skip them, and that’s okay. I like to have a variety of topics and guests and formats on the show to keep you interested, but everything is focused on helping bootstrapped and mostly bootstrap SaaS founders get to where they want to go faster. And if in each episode I can have some type of nugget or wisdom to help multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups, then my work is complete. So I want to kick it off by looking at maybe two of the predictions. I think I had seven predictions for SaaS Bootstrappers in 2024. This is episode 697, released in mid-January, and there are a couple of them that I have additional thoughts on because we’re now four months past. The first one is that there is opportunity in vertical SaaS, and obviously horizontal is where you cater to all industries. Vertical is where you focus on a specific industry or niche. And in a YouTube video I released about a month ago, I coined the term orthogonal SaaS, which is something that it was on my radar in the back of my mind, but I didn’t have a good name for it when I recorded the podcast episode. But Orthogonal SaaS is this third type, it’s horizontal SaaS that is focused on a specific role or title within a company. So think of software that helps HR or people ops, recruiters obviously that can be used by almost any company around the world to help them find new people or onboard them. Think of an ATS applicant tracking system, but it’s focused on a very specific role or title. It’s not a true horizontal play, much like think of Savvy Cal, Signwell, and Castos, which can be used across industries. And if you think about those tools, you could have one of many titles using electronic signature or a scheduling link. So those are not orthogonal, they’re just horizontal and it’s not a better or worse situation. But what we’ve seen across the TinySeed companies we’ve invested in is that horizontal plays, true horizontal plays get really competitive and there’s often a big player that you’re fighting against, which is okay, but it can make marketing and sales more difficult if you don’t have that specific title to focus on. And so the nice part about going vertical is oftentimes you pick an industry, it’s accounting for hair salons or whatever. That’d be a terrible idea by the way, don’t do that. But accounting for whatever niche industry you want to pick, and you don’t have to be the best marketer in the world, you just have to be the best marketer in your space. Similar with orthogonal SaaS, you have this product and you know exactly who your end user is. So you can go to in-person events, you can target them with cold outreach, you can go where they hang out. Are they on Quora? Are they on SEC overflow? Are they in private Facebook groups or private Slack groups? It really lends an advantage if your ICP is actually categorized with a title or a role at a company. And I just wanted to add that on because in the episode, I talked about opportunity in vertical SaaS and I was pitting vertical versus horizontal as if it was a bimodal. But really there’s this third category of orthogonal. I want to tack that on here that some of the more successful companies we are seeing with TinySeed are vertical or orthogonal. So I’m excited to see what 2024 brings for those types of companies. The second prediction I want to touch on is I predicted that Twitter changes hands in 2024? And I don’t know about you, but does it feel like the writings on the wall that Twitter is going to be snapped up by someone at a deep discount? Obviously there’s rumors about this happening. There’s no updated news, but as the months go on, I’m more and more convinced, especially with recent Tesla decline. They just did a big round of layoffs. I can imagine that the lack of focus, Elon trying to run all these efforts could lead either him to sell it or someone to swoop in and want to acquire it. So I mean, there’s ridiculous rumors or even just people speculating on Twitter about Yahoo buying them or Microsoft, or it could be any one of a number of players, but I still think this is totally going to happen, and I double down. A lot of the predictions that I’ve made over the years haven’t happened for two, three or four years. So I would be off by a few years, but I have a feeling that the clock’s ticking on this one. All right, so now an update on me, what I’ve been up to, how I’ve been feeling. So about a year ago, I think it was April or May of last year, I started talking about how I was experiencing pre-burnout. I started feeling like just a lack of desire to go to work every day. And that’s weird for me because I love what I do on a day-to-day basis. And over the summer it had decreased and in the fall it came back with a vengeance. We did, I don’t remember how many, but it was… I think I took seven business trips in 12 weeks or something. It was crazy. Some of it was MicroConf, some of it was TinySeed, and some of them were speaking engagements around my book, the Sass Playbook. And what I realized as I hit the end of the year was I was pretty deep into burnout. I stopped being able to show up and be present when… I was shipping YouTube videos and shipping podcast episodes to the best of my ability. But there was just no spark there, no desire to get up and do it. It was purely because the show had to go on. So what I did, I talked about this four months ago. What I did was I was able to back off from some day-to-day responsibilities just for a few weeks. It was probably about two weeks that I took almost completely off. I still recorded YouTube and podcast episodes because I had to, and I did some thinking and a little bit of writing. But really I didn’t go to any meetings. I didn’t show up day-to-day for work. People could reach out to me and I handled it, but I was “off work” for about two weeks. And then the week before that was Christmas and I went to Cancun with my family and the week before that was the week before Christmas, which is always pretty slow. So I wound up having a month of relative downtime in quotes. And I also made the decision that I just cannot travel this year nearly as much as I did last year. And so talked to the team and everyone else felt the same way. That was the good news. So there are some TinySeed events that I’ve gone to in the past that I won’t be going to this year, and we decided to shelve the MicroConf Locals for now. So MicroConf Locals are where we swoop in for a three-hour event and we bring MicroConf to you. And the toll that it was taking on not just me, but my whole team and the level of effort and cost and time for a relatively modest turnout, it just wasn’t worth it. It wasn’t moving the needle in the way that so many of our other efforts do. And when you’re doing, we have six or seven major efforts in MicroConf. If you think about it, TinySeed is one. State of independent SaaS. There’s the YouTube channel, there’s this podcast, there’s Mastermind Matching, there’s MicroConf Connect, our subscription community. There are in-person events, there are remote events. We do a lot with MicroConf and some of them are beloved and amazingly successful. And obviously so, and some of them you get a kind of lukewarm reception. And so when we would fly to Miami and there’d be 30 people, 35 people in a room, producer Xander who flew in from Hawaii and me from Minneapolis, we were kind of asking ourselves, is this worth it? If we can get 75, 90 people in a room, that feels good. But when 30, 40 people show up, it started to be like, is this the best use of our time? And so we’re shoving those for now. What that means is I’ve only had one work trip in the past three, three and a half months. And with MicroConf, we’re only doing two in-person events this year. It is our flagship event in Atlanta, which happens probably as this is going live. Actually, I believe it happened last week based on the publication day, but MicroConf flagship in Atlanta and then MicroConf Europe, which looks to be in Croatia in early October. And that’s it. And that’s great. It feels good. It’s kind of like getting back to how we used to do it a little bit. I mean, we certainly experimented and I don’t regret doing that. I mean, we had planned to do Locals 2020 and then COVID happened and we did some in 2021. I think we did three or four at the end of the year, and then we did eight in 2022 and between six and eight in 2023. And it feels like an amazing accomplishment that we pulled those off. But at a certain point, as an entrepreneur, you have to make the decision of where do we put our focus and our efforts. As I’m recording this, of course, a couple days before MicroConf in Atlanta, and I’m stoked. I hope I am able to see several of you there. The event last year in Denver was just a smashing success in terms of engagement and ticket sales and all the folks who showed up. So I hope to see you there. On less happy news, you may have heard that producer Xander, who has produced MicroConf for 10 years is moving on to his next adventure. And for the first five years he worked with me on MicroConf. He was a contractor that just ran the two flagship events. And then about five years ago, we decided to really double down. This is when MicroConf went from a hobby to a full-time project for me. And Producer Xander came on full-time and had been running the team for the past five years and doing an amazing job of it. And if you’ve been to any event, you know how good he is at what he does, and MicroConf would not be the same without him. So it’s obviously bittersweet to have him move on, but 10 years is a long time to work on a project. And obviously I wish him nothing but the best, and I hope that you are able to give him warm wishes on his way to his next adventure. Update on this podcast. The numbers continue to grow slowly over time. That’s what podcasts do. It’s not like YouTube where everything goes up into the right so quickly. The April Fool’s episode was a ridiculous hit. I had no idea how many comments and how much feedback I would get on it. And no, that does not make me want to do another one next year. I think part of the reason it worked is because we’ve done two or three in the history of this show, 14 years, 711 episodes, and this was the third time, and I think it’d been six or seven years since the last one. So I am just happy that folks got a kick out of it. I’m sure there’s someone out there who’s disgruntled about it because they’re a grump and don’t like April Fool’s, and that’s fine. But I personally don’t like April Fool’s either, and that’s why I don’t do April Fool’s episodes very often, but I really did. I cringed as I recorded that episode. It was fun to push live and it’s so fun to see the responses. I’m still getting them. It shows you the delays of podcasts. It’s two, three weeks later and I’m still getting emails. I’m getting comments on Spotify. I’m getting comments on the YouTube channel. I don’t know if you knew this, but there’s a little known YouTube channel that we don’t promote that is just the startups for the rest OS feed. It is audio only with a logo because producing video is just expensive enough that we push the audio only, but a lot of engagement on all the platforms and it’s always striking the things that resonate with people are the things that get people’s attention. And I guess on April Fool’s episode and going back on things that I’ve been saying for a decade was surprising enough that folks wanted to weigh in. So I appreciate it if you reached out to me about it. Oh, I realized I tangented off of burnout and just how I’m feeling when MicroConf started for the rest of us, but it totally recharged me, taking that time off and just looking ahead at the next year, meaning 2024, re-energized me on my mission and for the team and for just everything we’re doing. It made me so excited and I came back all guns blazing and the excitement to record this podcast, the excitement to work on a new book, which I’ll talk about in a minute, returned. Just everything clicked for me. And by mid-January, I was through it and it hasn’t come back. And I am very thankful for that because I’ve been in burnout before where it’s just off and on for months and months and months and it sucks. And I’m glad I was able to get ahead of it this time. Glad I was able to notice it and glad I had the luxury to be able to step back, that the timing kind of worked. I will admit I was going to take time off in February or March, and I eventually just said, I’m going to take whatever time I can off now and just try to get it done. And so I’m feeling so much better overall about how things are going. And when your outlook is positive and ambitious and optimistic, it changes everything. It changes every day, it changes every effort that you make. 2024 has already been a pretty amazing year, aside from obviously Xander moving on. There’s just been a lot of stuff that continues to work. TinySeed, the funding arm of MicroConf and the startup accelerator that I run with my good pal, Interval Set. So we have just made all of our offers for, I believe it’s 13 and 14, we’ve actually lost count, puts us just over 170 companies that we will have invested in all B2B SaaS, and it puts my total to a low 190, so almost 200 companies overall. That continues to be a relatively unique vantage point in the world. I don’t know how many people have insight into that many startups, much less SaaS startups. It’s not thousands, I think it’s hundreds if I were to say. And so as a result, it allows me to see patterns across many companies, to see trends and not just wonder is it an anomaly? If I’m looking at one company or five companies, the N is very small, but approaching 200 starts to become pretty… I mean, I would say it became pretty statistically significant even in around a hundred, 150. But so much of what I’m seeing becomes fuel for content on this podcast or fuel for the SaaS Playbook. A lot of that came out of TinySeed experience or fuel for my next books that I will talk about in just a minute. So I continue to feel like I’m kind of serving my highest calling by doing MicroConf TinySeed in this podcast. And TinySeed feeds my entrepreneurial desires and drives in a way that I hoped it would, but I wasn’t sure. That was one thing when I said I’m not going to start a SaaS app again, which my wife, Dr. Sherry Welling told me that’s bullshit, but I have not started another one. It’s been eight years. And one reason for that is that Microconf and TinySeed keep me in the game, so to speak. They keep my head in the entrepreneurial game because I’m around founders. I’m giving advice to founders, I’m thinking through founder level problems pretty much every day. And so it feeds that part of me, the desire to accomplish. And I live a little bit vicariously through the founders that I’m invested in and advising. And it’s the desire to just be in the game, and I still feel like I’m there. So that’s good because I know when I first started TinySeed, what was this? October of 2018, so going on six years now, someone said to me, it was an acquaintance, but he said, “How long are you going to do this? You’ve never stuck with anything more than three years or whatever.” Drip was three and a half years from start to sale and then another almost two years. So about five and a half years of working on it. But he was kind of trying to call me to the carpet, but also pointing out a factor that I do tend to bounce from one thing to the next. And obviously that was on my mind of if I start TinySeed, how long do I have to do it if it gets to the point where I don’t enjoy it? Because if I do it for a year and then bail, that’s going to suck because we have this fund, we’re investing and all that. And I realized that that hasn’t happened, and it’s probably the first job I’ve ever had in my life that I haven’t gotten really tired of and wanted to move on from. I just haven’t really had that desire. Aside from when I was burned out, I was like, I don’t want to do anything. But I knew that that was temporary and it wasn’t TinySeed. It wasn’t MicroConf. It wasn’t the job. It was, I just didn’t want to do any work. And that’s what, of course, burnout can do to your mind. So I’m very happy to be past that. One other big win on the TinySeed front and then I’ll move on to my books is that we ran our first annual Tiny Fest. While we didn’t know it was going to be annual, it was an experiment. It was an event that was for TinySeed founders only. It was in Cancun in January, and it was the first work thing I did after coming off of my few weeks of vacation. And it was a great time. It was awesome to get founders together from different batches and different years that had seen each other in our Slack but had never met in person. So my hats off to Tracy Osborne and Alex Mccuaid, part of the TinySeed team for pulling that together. And we are already talking about having another one later this year. So if you’re curious to learn more about that, actually it was a super fun event and you can search for Tiny Fest and they did a write-up with photos on the TinySeed blog. Oh, one other update before I get to my book. Some folks have asked me about TinySeed Tails and whether that is continuing. Yes. So season five of TinySeed Tales, which appears on this feed is in the works, the Founder that I’m interviewing had to completely reboot, basically do a massive pivot. And so it’s almost a restarting. And so as a result, there isn’t really a season story arc to put out. We’d kind of be leaving it dangling if we published what we have now. So I am slowing down the recording pace. Usually it’s every four to six weeks, but now it’s about every two, two and a half months as the founder is making progress. I’m doing the same documentary style recording that we have done in the past where I talked to a founder over the course of a year. In this case it’s going to be maybe 18 months. And then we compress that into seven to 10 episodes to show their whole journey and has voiceovers and music and all that. So that is in the works. We’ve also ran into some issues with editors and producers, and so we are working to get that resolved, but hope to have season five of TinySeed Tales here in maybe the fall of 2024. All right, last update for today is on my books. So the SaaS Playbook has continued to sell really well, and I don’t know if I should be surprised, but it is quickly going to outpace Start Small, Stay Small, I believe Start Small, Stay Small, my closest estimates have it selling around 30,000 copies, just over 30,000. And for a self-published book published by a guy with a quite small audience 14 years ago, that’s good. It has had a life much longer than I originally anticipated, as you can tell by some of the examples are a little bit dated and many of the links don’t work. But the Gestalt, someone read it the other day for the first time and said, oh, 80% of what’s in here is mindset and it’s still as valuable as the date was written, so I really appreciated that sentiment. But just over 30,000 with Start Small, Stay Small over 14 years. The SaaS Playbook is almost at 24,000 and it’s been out less than a year, and it continues to sell over a thousand copies a month between 1,000 and 1,200 copies, I believe. And I guess that kind of makes sense, right? Start Small, Stay Small, it is a niche. It’s like that cult film that gets a following, but mainstream folks would never pick it up, partially because the cover’s so ugly and partially because it’s just very focused. What’s the subtitle? A Developer’s Guide to Building a Startup. So if you’re not a developer or you don’t consider yourself building a startup, you’re just not going to pick it up, versus the SaaS Playbook, build a multimillion-dollar startup without venture capital. I just think the appeal is so much broader and I’m really pleased to see that all the hard work. I mean, I put a lot of time and money and effort into writing the book, then having it edited, then having it designed, then having the cover design, then doing the Kickstarter and on and on and on. And it is very gratifying to see that into the hands of literally tens of thousands of people. And again, my mission is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. And the SaaS Playbook is yet another way to do that and a way to do it relatively cheap. I enjoy giving stuff away for free. This podcast, the YouTube channel, and SaaS Playbook might be viewed as the next rung up the ladder. You can get it for $10 in PDF from SaaSplaybook.com or $10 in Kindle from Amazon. Or obviously you can get a paperback copy and Audible and all that. But it’s a nice way to be able to offer what I hope is a lot of value in a compact package for not a lot of money. And so it is very gratifying to have a lot of people reading it. And that leads me to my next two books. So my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling, is a psychologist and a founder and entrepreneur coach who runs a successful consulting firm at ZenFounder.com. So many of her clients have exited, are thinking about exiting, are agonizing over exiting, are in the middle of the exit process. And I, of course, having my own stories, but also secondhand stories of dozens of founders that I’ve talked with given advice to and just learned from the agony of it. So we are writing a book and I would say we have about half or three quarters of the content kind of outlined and in play, but it’s not actually written. So I would say book’s probably 20, 25% done, and we’re looking on… We’re hitting it hard over the summer, but it’s really focused. There’s a little bit of the mechanics of exiting and there’s a lot about the mindset about before, after, how to think about your team, about how to mentally prepare for it, about thinking through whether you should sell, about whether you’re going to have regrets, about just on and on and on. And the cool part is just everything’s taken from our experience of talking to founders who have done this, are doing it, are agonizing over it, got screwed, have regrets. Whatever it is, is going into this book. So I don’t want to say it’s the Psychology of Exits because that sounds a little academic, but it is definitely a different take on selling your company. It’s not necessarily focused on SaaS. Obviously there’s a lot of SaaS examples because of my network and the folks we’re interviewing around it, but Sherry’s clientele has some SaaS in it, but there’s a lot of just business owners that own brick and mortars or that own consulting firms or agencies or some variation of a business that sells. And so we hope that it has a little bit wider appeal than even say the SaaS Playbook, and we hope when it comes time that you will check it out. Last update is a book I’ve mentioned offhand a few times, but I’ve since decided on the title. It is called the SaaS Launchpad, and I just got a cover designed, the manuscript is complete, but I need to reread it and rewrite some pieces of it. It goes out of date so quickly, even if you try not to or really my thinking changes or I have better examples and better thoughts and better ideas around certain things as I create more content on this channel, more content on the YouTube channel, do thinking, speaking and writing. And I’ll revisit the book and be like, oh, I don’t necessarily fully agree with that anymore. Or there’s a better way to say that now is what happens a lot. So I started reading through it the other day and I was kind of like your software’s never finished, and frankly, books are never finished. You eventually just ship them and you give into the fact that a week later you’re going to look at something and say, ah, I wish I’d said that differently. I wish I’d added more. But I’m excited about the SaaS Launchpad because it is kind of like a prequel to the SaaS playbook. So the SaaS Playbook is about bootstrapping and mostly bootstrapping multimillion dollar SaaS companies. It starts, you have a product, you have some revenue, and you have what I call weak product market fit. You’re kind of figuring it out. You’re at an early stage. How do you strengthen product market fit is an early topic, pricing, marketing, building your team mindset, all that stuff. The SaaS Launchpad was almost a harder book to write because it is the earlier stages. It’s like, how do I come up with ideas? How should I think about competition? How do I validate ideas? Can I pre-validate ideas? How do I think about building a launch list? What does it look like to launch? How do I think all this through? The challenge is you can’t be as prescriptive because there is no blueprint for this early stage ideation stuff. There is kind of a blueprint. The SaaS playbook is pretty prescriptive about a lot of things because I do think there are best practices, rules of thumb that can guide you to get to the next level. Obviously, every company is different, every startup is different, but if you flip to the early stage, it’s a lot of wandering, but at best you have a compass. It’s not a map. And so at best it’s like directionally, this is kind of where you have to go. And so that’s what I was trying to do and hopefully have accomplished it in this SaaS Launchpad. And I don’t know when I will publish it because there’s a bunch of other stuff going on. I’m actually recording a video course for MicroConf right now, and you know how it is. It’s just priorities. I also don’t want to launch three books within 12 months of each other because I do think that it can become a little oversaturated. But that’s in the works. Obviously, if you’re interested in this book, keep listening to this podcast. You can go sign up. Oh, I should tell you StartupsForTheRestOfUs.com, the email list, if you sign up for that, obviously you’ll hear about my books, but you’ll also get an email every week with detailed show notes of each episode, and you will get two never before heard episodes. One is called Eight Things You Must Know When Launching Your SaaS, and the other is 10 Things You Should Know As You Scale Your SaaS.

This week I have fan favorite, Ruben Gamez, back on the show, and we talked through several listener questions, really good listener questions this week. And I’m not just saying that, people sent in video and audio asking questions like, so if I build a SaaS with no audience, how do I find people to talk to? If I build in no code, should I be concerned that I can’t export my code? Thoughts about going horizontal versus vertical, building a prosumer SaaS and more. Before we dive into that, you should check out MicroConf Connect at microconfconnect.com. This is our online community and forum. We host it in Slack and we’re approaching 7,000 members. They’re bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. Recent conversations in Connect, including a debate about magic sign-in links, how long you should spend diving into a niche before deciding on the product offer, how to safeguard your product from misuse during free trials, at what point in your journey should you invest in a conference booth, and more. It’s a vibrant and highly moderated community. Very high signal-to-noise if you’re looking to find and hang out with other misfits like you and I, head to microconfconnect.com. And with that, let’s dive into listener questions. Ruben Gamez, welcome back to Startups For the Rest of Us.  Ruben Gamez:Thanks. Great to be here.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s always good to have you, man. We have some really interesting listener questions today, all audio or video. As always, if you want to submit a question and you want it to go to the top of the stack, make sure to send audio or video, text questions do still get answered now and again, and let’s dive in to our first question from Jay Lee.  Jay Lee:Hey Rob, my name is Jay and I’m from LA. Loving the pod, so thanks so much. I had a quick question about how and where to talk to your first users, especially early on in your app’s life. So recently, I saw your post on X about how you don’t need an audience to start a SaaS, and that in fact less than 5% of the companies you invest in have any sort of audience at all, and it makes sense. So my question is then, assuming that you’re a programmer with zero audience, starting from scratch, what does your strategy look like? For example, let’s say you want to build software to help people run in-person conferences. Do you just go to some r slash conferences Subreddit and start posting questions? Do you just join some Facebook group and post, “What problems do you guys have?” Or do you cold DM people on LinkedIn with any conference manager title and ask them questions? So what would be your specific strategy and approach here? Thanks again and love the work you do.  Rob Walling:So I like this question because it’s fun. I’m Mr. Don’t Build An Audience If You’re Going To Build A SaaS, or it’s not don’t build an audience, but if you don’t already have an audience and that’s not an amazing gifting of yours and you really want to do it and all this and that, don’t do it. Don’t listen to the advice. And I come back to the less than 5% of all TinySeed funded companies, which is just 170 now, less than 5% had any kind of audience when they started or even have any kind of audience today. And it’s fun to me though when I say that and then Jay Lee writes in and says, okay, so then what? Because that’s kind of cool, right? It’s like, oh, someone’s listening and they buy into it, but it’s like, so then what do I do? Help me with the next step. So with that, I’ll kick it over to you Mr. Guy with an incredibly successful business and no audience. How do you think about the questions he’s thinking about?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it’s funny because you would think based off of what you see on Twitter and all that stuff that everyone has an audience and that’s how they start their business. But most of the people that I talk to and just like you’ve always said, they don’t start that way. So I’ve done it twice without an audience. I feel like that’s good because that means it’s the default. So the way that he phrased the question was interesting to me. It’s like, okay, he said in person, people who run in person conferences, you reach out to them and all that. How do you start to get those? How do you start to market those? I feel like that might be a little bit of a dangerous way to approach it. I’d start with the research side first, and I say dangerous because you could be in the right community. Let’s say you find a community, and I did this with Bidsketch back in the day, found a community of designers, a couple of community of designers for trying to validate the product, trying to see if there was interest there in buying, and then got nothing. And that was a negative signal. I think one of the things that a lot of people don’t talk about enough is that if you can have the right type of person, but the context could be wrong. They could be, the reason why they’re in this community might be a topic that doesn’t align with your product. So you might get, there are always segments of a type. So people that are running conferences, there might be people who are running conferences in a certain way or certain types of conferences that won’t make for good customers. That might be an issue. Or if you’re using ads and you have some bait, like a lead magnet or something like that, if that doesn’t align well with the type of product that you’re selling, like if you’re selling something on the money side, software for people who run conferences for monetizing conferences, but the bait that you use has nothing to do with that, that might also be a bad signal that you get there. So I’d start with the research side and I think about it in terms of talking to people who are potential customers. So yes, reaching out through LinkedIn, reaching out to Twitter through these communities, however you could find them, tell them that you’re researching a problem and not talk about the solution. Some of them will talk to you, some of them won’t. Also, I like to talk to founders who have sold into the space, who have the same type of product or had it in the past, failed or succeeded with it. I did this with SignWell. Talk to people who were in the electronic signature space as founders and get their perspective. The other side of it, like how hard it is, how they sold, what things are effective. And then sometimes talk to in slightly bigger companies when they have sales and marketing specialists, talk to somebody who’s done that role and try to learn from them. Not going too big because if I’m talking to somebody, in the early days, I did this, I talked to somebody, two people that one did growth and one did marketing for e-signature companies, but the companies, they were successful and they were larger than I’d be starting, but not so large. They weren’t DocuSign or something like that, which wouldn’t really be that relevant to me. And you get, I feel like a really good perspective on price points, on channels that work, on trade-offs, things that are good that are not so good, all that before you start marketing and then just are more informed about how to go approach your marketing.  Rob Walling:And it sounds like you would, if you have any kind of network in this space, you’d start with that because that’s easy, right?  Ruben Gamez:Definitely.  Rob Walling:If I know I happen to know five or six people who run conferences because I run conferences, but if I was going to build a product for in-person events, I would instantly go to them and I would ask them questions and “Hey, who else do you know who I can talk to?” Right?  Ruben Gamez:Yes.  Rob Walling:That’s the next, it’s the star.  Ruben Gamez:That’s a great way of doing it.  Rob Walling:Yes. But if you don’t know anyone, so you know zero, you have no network in the space. Well, you do exactly what you said, cold DMs, there’s LinkedIn, there’s Twitter, there’s Facebook, there’s Instagram, there is cold email, whatever way you can do it. And I do think, I mean Jay mentioned, do you go into a Facebook group or a Subreddit and start asking, “What problems do you have?” Or whatever. No, I wouldn’t. I would lurk.  Ruben Gamez:Right. See what naturally is brought up.  Rob Walling:Yep. I would want to see what’s brought up because look, people want to bitch about things and they bitch about… You know what I mean? So it’s like you don’t need to ask. You’re going to just notice. I have a few hobbies. I collect high-end vintage, Silver Age and Golden Age comic books. I play Dungeons and Dragons, and so I’m in those Subreddits and Facebook groups and this and that, and it’s the same shit every week. Someone complained about this grading company and someone complaining about Wizards of the Coast, the maker of Dungeons and Dragons doing the same thing. Again, you don’t have to ask anyone what the problems are or what their opinions are, they’re sharing them. And I feel like in-person event operators are going to have a similar thing. Now maybe they won’t complain as much as consumers whining about a tabletop game they should take way less seriously than they do. But if people who run events, we have similar problems and they’re just going to be talked about on a regular basis, maybe not every week, but you know that once a month, the same topic that’s bugging everybody and hopefully it’s like, “Ooh, does anyone use…” I’m going to bring up makeup example. “Anyone use Eventbrite? Oh my gosh, their fees are so awful and their software is terrible and it doesn’t do dynamic coupon codes.” And then I’m like, “Wait, what?” So now I’ve been part of this thing, checking in on it every day for a week or a month, and I get the tone. You start to understand just the gestalt and how people talk and how they interact. And then you chime in, “Oh hey, here’s a…” Either you can DM them on Reddit, I believe like private message or you can chime in thoughtfully. Not, “I’m selling something.” But you can say, “I’m a software entrepreneur. I’m researching something. I’m actually in the press of potentially building something that could blah, blah, blah.” You got to watch the tone of some Subreddits are so anti-marketing yourself that you may just need to PM, private message or DM people that you literally can’t. Like, you post a URL to your thing and you’re kicked out of the Subreddit. I’ve heard of that. So it depends, but you just have to be sensible about it and tactful.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. The last thing that I forgot to mention related to all that was competitor research and looking at reviews and seeing the negative reviews and what people are complaining about there.  Rob Walling:Whether it’s like Capterra, whether it’s going to Google, ask ChatGPT, anywhere, any of the review and rating sites, just take them all with a grain of salt. But I agree, you start to get a picture of what people are upset about and what they don’t like. And here’s the thing with in-person events, I know that Eventbrite’s huge, it’s the 900 pound gorilla and therefore there’s a bunch of stuff they do poorly because that’s what big companies do over time, it just happens. So that’s actually an interesting space. Now there are, how many ticketing platforms do you think exists that ARG’s taking advantage of that? I mean, there’s got to be a hundred, literally a hundred. So then you start to think, okay, so am I looking for a unique position? Am I looking for an angle no one else is covering? Or am I looking for an angle? Think something that people are complaining about that they can’t find a solution to. So again, am I trying to be unique that no one else is doing? Or am I willing to compete with a couple of the others in this space if I think I can execute better and market better? How do you think about that?  Ruben Gamez:If you are trying to be unique and do something that nobody’s doing in this space, then just I think that’s a valid approach. But I also think it’s higher risk because no one’s proven that people will pay for that thing. So it’s just to understand where the risk is and then approach that first. I’d prove that out as true or false first before trying to approach distribution or marketing or anything like that. Because that’s the highest risk that no one will pay for this thing and it doesn’t… Like you reaching the right type of people won’t matter in that context. So I tend to prefer having competition. If it’s too competitive, then the risk becomes like, can you get distribution? And that’s the thing that I really focus on.  Rob Walling:Can you out market them?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Right. Then you look at what your skill set, what you think you can do. I want to say just two other things about how I might do this, find people. One is you have no audience, that’s fine, but still, if you have a Twitter account, you have a Facebook account, you have an Instagram account, whatever you have, post on there and say, if you’re following me, I’m an entrepreneur and I’m looking to talk to anyone who runs an in-person event, big or small, if you are or you know them, it’d be amazing if you… You know what I mean? It may do nothing, but it does, it takes three minutes. And so it’s like just promoting it. You say you have no audience, you probably have at least a hundred people that follow you somewhere. So that’s another way to do it. It’s not a silver bullet, but it might get you something. And then I’m curious for you, you started with SignWell, which is the best electronic signature app on the market. You started doing SEO way before you had a product, you were generating traffic. But my question for you is, had you already done all this research before that point when you started the SEO?  Ruben Gamez:The very first thing that I did was research on the distribution side, research different channels, SEO, and then, I’m trying to think of the timing. I felt like I started all that almost at the same sort of time. Once I felt good about distribution, then it was like, okay, let me better understand this. And it was not a case. So if I did something on the SEO side, it’s maybe I started with a couple of things that I felt were easier and I could start to get the right type of traffic, the right type of leads. But at the same time or very close soon after that, it was literally talking to all these people and understanding what I was getting myself into from as many perspectives as I could. So even though I felt like, okay, people are paying for this type of product and all this stuff, and the risk was on the distribution side, I still wanted to better understand why people buy and what distribution looked like. So I don’t know if that’s how I approached it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that makes sense. Well, the reason I was asking is because 10 years ago, SEO was, I think it’s inarguable that it was easier. It was simpler than it is today. There were times when I was trying to validate some ideas that I never built. I was going to build some software for coaches, not more like sports coaches at universities, this whole thing. I never did because the validation didn’t come through. But I actually just, there were terms that had so little competition that I threw up a landing page and I built some links to it, which again, easier to do, but maybe it was like 12 years ago, you could do one of the private blog networks. Remember the PBNs? Is that what those were called?  Ruben Gamez:Oh. Yeah. That was fun.  Rob Walling:So I could literally get a page to rank in a week or two for terms, you know what I mean? And so would do that with a landing page that captured email, and then I would reach out and say, what are you looking for? Blah, blah, blah. So that was my way of doing it. Now, it’s not that easy today, but I still think if I were to launch a SaaS today, I would get a landing page up very early for me because of course, I’m always talking about it on podcasts. With Drip, I was spending a non-inconsequential amount of money, maybe a thousand a month, maybe more on Facebook ads when-  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I remember you were doing Facebook ads.  Rob Walling:It was just a landing page. There was no SEO to it, and you could do AdWords. So here’s the thing, if people are searching for it, you do AdWords. If not, and you know the type of role then you run ads on, it’s either Facebook or LinkedIn is tougher to make it work. It’s just the way their tech isn’t as good, their AI isn’t as good, so you have to do a lot more manual stuff. But there you can target job titles and that’s the key. If you know the job title, you go there. If you know the demographics, psychographics, you go to Facebook. And if you want intent and there is actual volume, then you go to Google if you have any money to spend. So zero audience, but you can still drive people and look, could you drive them a landing page and say, opt in to learn more? Yes. Could you drive them to a landing page and say, I’m thinking about building this thing. It’s me in a little video. “Hey, my name’s Rob. Click the button below and just book a time with me. Here’s my Savicat link. And just book a time on my calendar because I want to talk to you.” You’re just trying to do stuff to get into conversations.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I did that with Twitter ads for SignWell, Twitter ads to a, I don’t remember the exact hook that I used. It was something related to costs for e-signature or something like that I think. And it was going to a survey and then I was pre-qualifying them on the survey just trying to find out if I wanted to talk to them. And if I did, then I’d offer them an incentive because this was cold, to talk to people it’s harder, super cold, especially off an ad like that. And if not, then I just added them to a list. So back then, especially when I did it, it was expensive, it was too expensive, I wouldn’t recommend it. But there are so many different ways of doing it.  Rob Walling:And to be clear, you’re not going for any type of ROI on these ads. This is a research cost.  Ruben Gamez:Exactly.  Rob Walling:Yeah. You’re not trying to make sales at all. You’re just paying for the privilege of speaking to folks.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, you’re paying for the data.  Rob Walling:All right, so that may go down in history as the longest Startups For the Rest of Us question, but it’s good and thorough, dude, honestly. So probably the next book that I’m going to publish is called the SaaS Launchpad and it’s like a precursor to SaaS Playbook, what we just said needs to go in there. I literally made, the manuscript is quote, unquote done, but it’s not locked down. So I think I’m going to go back through what we just said and try to pull out a section. Because this is very, that’s the most in-depth, I think I’ve ever talked about this topic. So thanks for doing that with me.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it’s cool. And it was cool seeing you do it for Drip because I do remember that. I thought that was a really interesting approach that you had.  Rob Walling:Just scraping and clawing, trying to get people to pay attention. We’ve been partnering with Lemon.io for several years and they’ve proven to be a great choice when it comes to hiring for a highly skilled developer to work on your project.

Relatively new listener to your podcast, maybe a little over a year, really enjoying the topics and the conversations. Thank you for what you do. I’m a non-technical person. I’m a marketing guy, but I want to build something and I don’t have a technical person. So I came across these no-code tools like Bubble, and I’m trying to see if I can build something out on Bubble, but I also, I came across this video on YouTube that talked about how Bubble does not allow you to export its code when you need to scale or when you need to move servers. My question to you is how much of that is an issue? Should I be paying attention to that right now? I don’t even have an MVP to show for. So is this an important discussion right now? Should I just try using Bubble, build a product, see how the market interacts with it, and then tomorrow if I need to scale, worry about that then? Or should I be worried about this right now from the starting process and look for tools that will allow me to export code? I kind of like Bubble because it’s comprehensive. The learning curve is there, but I think I’ve kind of got a hang of what is there. The other tools don’t seem difficult to learn, but yeah, I just wanted to know what your opinion on this is. Thanks.  Rob Walling:I like this one. No one’s ever asked it. We’ve talked about platform risk and no-code platform risk specifically about relying on a single platform and your entire business is built on it and how they can raise prices or they could go out of business or whatever. But the idea of, hey, if I can’t export the code from Bubble, should I consider building on it? What’s your take?  Ruben Gamez:The one thing I wasn’t clear about was exporting the code from Bubble, does that mean it gets to a certain scale, people are paying for it, then export it because now we’re going to have developers work on that or something like that?  Rob Walling:I was thinking two reasons. One, what if Bubble were to 10x their pricing tomorrow or go out of business and just disappear off the internet or which you said, which is a year down the line, six months down the line, I need to move to code. Is there a migration path or do I just have to build it from scratch? So I think either of those would be factors that you would consider.  Ruben Gamez:I feel like I would not worry about the scaling part of it, and this is even if you’re writing the code, I wouldn’t worry about it too much unless you have experience and you kind of know both the market and the product and all that. I think of it more as almost like an MVP or first version and I’d expect it to be rewritten or maybe rewritten from scratch from code. The harder part really is like, will people pay for this? Can I get distribution for it? And those are the things that I’d be focusing on. And it’s funny, about a year ago I talked to somebody that had a no-code app that was in the e-signature space. It didn’t do the whole thing, but it was pretty aligned. I was like, “Oh, this is interesting.” It was focused on some forms and they’d gotten some paying customers, but they were stuck and they wanted to sell it. So I looked at buying it and I did not buy it because it was no-code and the no-code stuff was super complex. It was like the app itself wasn’t that hard, so it wasn’t that complicated. The UI wasn’t doing all this sort of tricky stuff. It was just like there were so many, if then else, so many different conditions, so much stuff in the no-codes for away and it was super verbose, and it was hard to understand. It wasn’t like I could go in there and be like, oh yeah, I can get somebody that can quickly understand this. So I just didn’t, feel like it would be more like I would buy and have to rewrite from scratch, and that’s kind of like even if I’m starting it from no-code, I’d think about it almost in that sort of same way when scaling.  Rob Walling:Well, I agree with you on the answer that when I heard this question, I thought if I’m going to build no-code, there is no-code export. There’s no platform that lets you do that. So you either do it and accept that risk or you don’t and you hire someone to write code or write the code yourself if you know how. I feel like it’s pretty straightforward decision and you just had a cautionary tale around building a no-code, but I don’t think you’re saying don’t build something in no-code.  Ruben Gamez:No, no.  Rob Walling:Yeah, because I’m not either. I mean folks have heard my take. My take tends to be a balance, like no-code is a tool, know what you’re getting into, much like venture capital and funding, bootstrapper funding is a tool. Know what you’re getting into. There are pros and cons to it and I have entire episodes of both of this show dedicated to that as well as on the YouTube channel because an extreme view of never no-code or always no-code, I’ve talked to people with both and I’m always just like every example you’re bringing up for the never is actually not, or the always is this, the one that drives me nuts of anything SaaS, everything can be built with no-code and you should. And I’m just like, “No, that’s a factually inaccurate statement.” So like anything, there’s a nuance, but thanks for that question. So the end result is don’t consider this an endorsement, but in my shoes and in Ruben shoes, if we’re going to do no-code, that’s one of the factors you have to take into account when you’re going to do it. And so I would not be bothered by the fact that you couldn’t export the code. Our next question is about going horizontal or vertical as this OP spins out an existing app that he’s built for consulting clients.  Dean:Hi Rob. I’m Dean, I’m a freelance software developer. I’m Dutch, but I live in Madrid. I was recommended your podcast by two friends who both have successful SaaS businesses and also have been to MicroConfs. So before I raise my question, I would like to give you a bit of context. For the last four years, I’ve been building this SaaS product for a client. It’s a tool for historic and geographical research that allows researchers to create and navigate relational and geographical data in one map center tool. And I built and designed this SaaS product from scratch with my client and we started an MVP, then we got some important clients on board and after four years it became quite a feature rich application and a good few high-touch customers with five-digit subscription fees are on board now. So think of governments and utility companies. So it will probably give me a steady stream of income from consultancy work. But now I’ve seen this was a success, I would like to have a bootstrap size of my own. And I would like it to be a spin-off of this SaaS, I learned a lot of tricks of the trade. I cannot copy the product, but I can use concepts and technology. My clients are happy with that to build something similar. So knowing that the original is a high-touch vertical SaaS in a very niche market, a lot of its success depended on the context and knowledge that my client already had. My question is, should I try to find another vertical in another niche possibly with a partner that has context in that niche, repeat a trick or should I extract some of the features, simplify them, go for a horizontal low touch approach? I have to say, I prefer the latter. I think it’s more bootstrapable, but I’m curious to know what you think. Thank you.  Rob Walling:So this is a super interesting question. What do you think about it, Ruben?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it is. I’m curious what your answer will be.  Rob Walling:I can go first if you want.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, why don’t you go first. I’m very curious.  Rob Walling:So my answer, what he’s really asking, he’s saying should I go into another vertical where it is, he’s implying that will be higher touch sales, higher ticket price and be more of an enterprise mid-market sell or go horizontal and only pull a couple pieces out and make it this self-serve. I presume 10, 20, $40 a month, whatever self-serve is, make it this low cost, he said more bootstrapable thing. And I don’t necessarily agree with the premise of that framing even. That acts like there’s only two ways to go and I don’t think there are. You could go with horizontal and just make it expensive. You could go horizontal and still do sales calls and do demos and close. The horizontal and the vertical is separate from the other factors. I think they’re less reliant on each other. In my head, if I were to do it, it does depend on exactly what… I’m struggling a bit because I don’t know exactly what the software does, so I almost want to know more detail. To me, if it worked in one vertical and you can stay in a vertical, a different vertical, that’s where you can charge the most. And although it will be enterprise sales and onboarding and this and that, to me I would go for high ticket price if you want to grow this to a million or multi-million dollar SaaS company. Those are the patterns that I’m seeing in the companies that I’m invested in. Now with that said, I am a marketer. Me personally, everything I’ve ever built, the starting ticket prices, like Drip was $50 and that was the most expensive SaaS I ever sold. That’s the starting price and obviously the average revenue for account was much higher than that. But I’m not a salesperson and I wouldn’t love starting an enterprise company where you get five new clients a year or 20 new clients a year and it’s 2000 AC, no 2000 per month each. It’s like what a… That’s just not my gifting. And so in his shoes, I would either not do it or I would figure out how can I make this horizontal and how can I make it more of something that I can market? But that’s not self-serve either because self-serve implies that it’s low annual contract value or low average revenue per account. So I’d be wondering, is this generalizable? Is the big question. Is anyone looking for it? That’s probably the first thing I do. We just talked about doing research. Everything we said for the very first question I would do for either a vertical or a horizontal play. Horizontal is a lot harder to do it because now who are you contacting? You reaching out to the world? Are you going on Hacker News and Reddit? You know what I mean? That’s the hard part. It’s like does anyone need it? Because if I’m just going to go, if I have code and I have ideas and learnings and I’m going to say, cool, I’m going to launch this new novel thing that really no one else is doing right now. It’s this cool thing that can do geographic with historical stuff and I’m going to try to sell it. I think of ancestry.com because there’s history, right? Well, that’s basically a B2C play, isn’t it? Or B to prosumer at best. I’m not going to be in that game. There’s no way. So if that’s the model where this works, then no, I’m not doing that. I’m going to go for the high ticket vertical enterprise play. That’s my thinking. I realized I’m thinking out loud, but what do you think about all this?  Ruben Gamez:So my thinking is pretty similar to that except that on the vertical versus horizontal… So it’s tricky. The way that he’s framing or saying, going horizontal is I agree, is implying a lower touch, lower price type product because he said simplify, sort of strip out the stuff. And when you do that, that’s basically what you’re aiming for. So in my space with SignWell, we sell to the low end of the market. We sell also to mid-market going towards enterprise and for our core product we have an API and then we have the core product. So for the core product, for us to be able to be horizontal and sell more towards mid-market and going towards enterprise, we needed to build more. We didn’t need to have a, we couldn’t do it with a simple product because larger companies and enterprises, the ones that are going to pay more for the product, even across verticals just have all sorts of different needs and the sophistication levels just higher. So the product needs to be more sophisticated, needs to do more. We had to also do more on the compliance and security side and I feel like it’s a harder thing to do. I feel like it’s probably one of the hardest things to do to be horizontal and go for the enterprise. I think it’s easier. It’s all kind of hard, right? Different types of hard. I think it’s a little easier though to stick with enterprise and a higher price or mid-market or whatever and go after a specific vertical, especially if… So in his case, he’s already done it. He has that experience. This is another thing, it sounds super easy to just be like, oh yeah, we’re just going to go with, and I hear this from time to time, with this more simple product, go self-serve and all that stuff and that, there’s a lot that seems great about that, but the reality is it’s a different game. It’s like different company and team DNA, it’s different founder, DNA. It’s a different skill set. And you need much bigger numbers. The way you approach things is just different. And if he already has the experience and the skill set to do it for one vertical, I’d kind of leverage that and take a similar approach for another vertical.  Rob Walling:That’s how I think about it too. The higher price, typically the lower the churn, the faster the growth. We see this in the state of independent SaaS when we ask about churn and lifetime value and ticket price and then we compare it to growth, it’s obvious that the higher [inaudible 00:32:26] value, lower the churn and higher ticket price, the math just makes that make sense, but we see it in TinySeed too. We see that, like I have a list of all the companies that are doing seven figures in ARR that are in TinySeed, and it’s a good list. One commonality you’ll notice is almost all of them, some of them have lower priced plans like SignWell where you can sign up, is it like $12 per person? But they also have a thousand dollars a month plan, a $2,000 a month plan, a $5,000 a month. There’s one of them that literally has a couple of contracts, ACV, quarter million dollars, and those are harder to sell. They take longer. You know this. You’re doing sales calls right now selling this stuff, but those are the ones that grow you quickest. Even with Drip, I talked about it being $50 starting price point. Most of our growth, especially as we got later, were folks paying us between $500 and $2,000 a month. It was the big lists that made them moved the needle for us. And that’s the pattern we see over and over. So the indie hacker dream or the bootstrapper dream of course is to have a $20 a month product, self-serve, everybody just handles it. You got a KB, there’s no support ever. Everything just [inaudible 00:33:33] on a beach in Bali or whatever. And that does exist, but that also plateaus pretty quickly. If you want to build a three, four, 5 million dollar business like that, it’s few and far between.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. The numbers that you need are just so big. I think people underestimate the scale that they need to get to that when you’re talking about a $10 a month type of business.  Rob Walling:So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. Our next question is from Francesco, how to approach a prosumer product.  Francesco :Hey Rob, it’s Francesco from Berlin. You are always advise against business to consumer product as they’re difficult to monetize and recommend in start building B2B SaaS. I totally agree with this, but I think there is also sort of a third category in between. There is the business to consumer or business to professional that we rarely discuss about. I want to get your thoughts about this space and I want to understand how would you approach such a business to clarify, I mean this kind of product like Notion or Linear or GitHub that they offer both a team or an enterprise plan but also the targeted for the individual use and they might be paid or free for the individual. I wanted to understand whether you see meaningful changes compared to a classical B2B SaaS and eventually which ones? And specifically if you were to build such business, if you first optimize for an individual to sign up and start using it and then potentially selling them to a team plan or the opposite, if you would go first after the company, the team’s plan and then eventually allowing the user to sign up and use it for a personal use. Thank you very much.  Rob Walling:So I feel like Francesco is talking about two different things. He talks about B to prosumer, B2P as we can say, and I do think we can talk about that, but he also gets a little bit into product-led growth and dual funnels. So I think we can talk a bit about both of those because those are not necessarily, those don’t have to be the same thing. You can make most of your money from enterprise and have a dual funnel so you’re serving prosumers or VSMBs or consumers for that matter. And then also have product-led growth and it can all be present or it doesn’t have to be. So I guess to start with, he asks about B to prosumer and he agrees he doesn’t want to do B2C, but I think he’s asking what is the difference? Is B to prosumer more similar to B2C, or is it more similar to B to SMB? And I’m actually going to, before I kick it to you, I want to go through a few things. I know I often say B2C and B2B, that implies there’s two, right? It’s a dichotomy. That’s not at all what it’s like. There’s B2C, there’s B2P, prosumer, which is, I will say it’s people who are making money from something but usually not doing it full-time. That’s how I define it. Like, photographers, lot of wedding photographers are like this, doing things on the weekend. A lot of fitness coaches are like this, B to prosumer. I think most indie hackers are this, where they make full-time living from other stuff and they’re building stuff on the side. I know a lot of interior decorators are interior designers who do it as a part-time thing. I think folks selling stuff on Etsy, most of those are prosumers where they’re making money, but it’s not their full-time income. There are a handful, but it’s like anything, it’s a power law. There’s a small number who are doing it. Then there’s, B to very small business. VSMB, B2SMB, B to mid-market, B to enterprise, B to government, B to schools. Each customer type is different. And in fact, at TinySeed I believe we’ve invested in companies who do every one of those, except I do not think we have anyone who sells to consumers. I mean we are B2B SaaS, so it makes sense we didn’t do that. I can’t offhand think of anyone selling to prosumers, but I do know folks in the MicroConf Community like Nate Grahek who’s been on the podcast and attended MicroConf, he has StickyAlbums which goes after photographers. And I’ve talked to him quite a bit about the challenges, the ups and downs of selling into that space. So with that preamble, Ruben, what are your thoughts on this question?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, the whole categorization of what’s prosumer and business and all this stuff is interesting. To me, I think of it a little bit differently than you do. So B2B, like business to business, to me, anyone in a business context, if they’re making money off is a business. So that would include freelancers and photographers and all that stuff. A prosumer to me is somebody like, and Craig from Castos I feel like sells to multiple, right? Somebody with a hobby that spends on software. So podcasting software is a really good example or podcasting hosting because there are a lot of people with podcasts that do it as a hobby, like founders or I listen to video game podcasts, all sorts of different MMA podcasts sometimes to where it’s like they’re not really making money off of these things in a business context, but it’s something that they’re spending and photographers sometimes fall under that category. Some of them are like they have clients and some of them are like, no, I’m spending money on this equipment and the stuff for me and for my own hobby and uses. So I don’t know that it matters too much, but I think the part that matters is that these are all different segments and how you approach them really makes a difference. What type of product that you build and how you get distribution. So if you’re, and let’s use Castos is a good example. So if you’re bottom of the funnel type content, buyer intent content will bring in a mix across all of these groups. So something like ranking for best podcast hosting will bring in everyone from somebody who’s doing it as a hobby but needs podcast hosting, somebody who’s doing it part-time, somebody who’s doing it full-time, a company that needs a podcast, a publication. And then once you start to move away from that, you kind of often need to understand the different segments and where they live, where they hang out and how to approach each of the different ones and how to do the messaging for them. So I feel like it’s sort of relevant from a distribution standpoint and from a building a product standpoint, they’re two, a couple ways of, I prefer, my preference is to start with bottom of the funnel and get a mix of the different types of segments so that I could talk to them and see them as customers and understand what I like better, what’s my preference as far as, not just who’s paying more, but who’s excited about the thing that I’m building in the way that it’s positioned maybe or if I see an opportunity to serve a certain segment. And I just like that variety early on and that’s kind of how I would approach it. It’s hard to approach it from a general marketing sense of just getting a bunch of tension and people and going really broad across all these segments. If you’re not going bottom of the funnel or by your intent, by your aligned sort of way of getting leads and traffic and customers, then I’d be very deliberate about picking a segment and starting with that. I think a lot of it has to do with personal strengths. Going back to the original question of how does this work, how do people sell, how do these different segments buy the software? And then what’s the opportunity I see and what do I like?  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. The way I think about prosumers is they are very similar to consumers. They are price sensitive. They churn at higher rates because usually it’s either, as you’re pointing out, you were putting hobbyists into prosumers, right? And whereas I was saying you have to make money. So we have a slightly different definition of it, which is fine. They’re going to churn way higher than businesses. They’ll churn similar to consumers. I don’t know if it’s exactly, I mean I’m sure it depends on the space, but know you’re going to have a high churn, low price point, high price sensitivity, therefore you are going to need a very wide funnel. Lot of incoming traffic as you said, SEO content, whatever it is. You’re not going to be able to buy Google AdWords and market to prosumers. I say not. I never want to say you can’t. I just am very, very skeptical that you’ll be able to attract folks in the prosumer space at any type of volume that will make it make sense with Google AdWords. So prosumer businesses, I know multiple founders who have built, definitely mid-six figure ARR SaaS companies for prosumers. I actually know multiple who’ve done seven figures and everything I’ve just said checks out. They’re like, man, quite a bit of support. Man, the churn is really high. I tried to raise my prices and usually they’re unable to raise prices the same way we were with enterprises. But what they do is they wind up adding a bunch of, you have this thing and now you have a thousand or 2000 prosumers, and then you have your email list of another 20,000 or whatever. So then you just build a second product alongside it and a third product or a module that you can charge. That’s how you get more average revenue per account. You can’t just do the typical B2B playbook of raising prices, charging annually, all that stuff.  Ruben Gamez:This just reminded me of who was it, Buffer, I think it was Buffer that ran into this problem. So they were able to build a very successful business with big numbers. They got there and they were still got to a point of where they were struggling with, okay, how do we grow this more and trying to increase the average revenue per customer and never really did, never really got there, really smart people working on it. It is a hard thing to do.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And they came out, who’s the founder that’s still there? Is Joel?  Ruben Gamez:Joel. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Joel’s the one that’s still there. Yeah. He tweeted within the last month where he was like, we kept trying to, and they’ve been declining for three years in revenue, but I mean it’s still like 17 million ARR or something. It’s a boots start company. But he was saying they kept trying to fight the churn and they were trying to go up market and do this and that, and they eventually decided we are for makers and creators, which are solidly prosumers usually because most of them not doing it full-time want to do it. And so he said, we just embraced it. We know our churn is going to be this and we either will widen our funnel or we’ll just ride this out because they will plateau in a good way. They’re going down now. So you want to plateau in that point because you want to level out and he’s saying, we think we’ll level out this year in 2024, and I’m sure the number’s going to be 15, 16 million ARR. And look, that’s not a bad business. It’s not a business… I personally would get bored with that. I need something to be going up into the right, otherwise I lose motivation and I’m sure, and it’s hard to hire really good ambitious people because they don’t want to work on a declining product or a flat product, but I’m not going to throw shade at Buffer or anything they’ve built because it’s a hell of a business.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it’s still a nice business. That brings up another interesting point too is that sometimes, so it’s super easy to just be like, well go after businesses because the retention is better and they pay more and you just need less customers and all this stuff. But the reality is that sometimes the opportunity is just kind of maybe on the lower end or maybe in a business like Buffer where it’s like a lot of prosumer, a lot of freelancers, and that’s the easier path. But then just kind of know what you’re getting into, what kind of issues you might hit.  Rob Walling:I had Christopher Gimmer on the podcast. He’s spoken at MicroConf a couple of times. Snappa.com. Yep. It is exactly this. It’s a high churn, relatively priced sensitive audience, but he and a co-founder bootstrapped it to, he’s pretty public about their numbers. I think they’re doing a million and a half or something like that and in that range, totally bootstrapped. And they just eventually realized, “Hey, we can’t grow this business anymore.” But they’re basically split. I mean, they’re super profitable and now they’re launching a second product and they just accept that there was a great opportunity that they took advantage of and they can’t outrun that churn, but they don’t need to because now they have this cash flowing business that can help them do the next thing and the next thing and the next.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, great example.  Rob Walling:And I think the part of the question he asked about Notion and GitHub having these free or super cheap plans, I think I pay $4 a month for GitHub and I have for years. I just don’t even know if I cancel it if I’m going to lose anything. So I just don’t ever, I’m just like, yep, every month I get billed four. I literally have no idea if there’s a repo that I need, but it’s like I can’t be bothered to go check the account for four bucks. And I’m a little bit like, I bristle a little bit when entrepreneurs ask about this because when people use Steve Jobs as an example, or Basecamp or these outlier folks, I feel like GitHub and Notion have how many hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank. And I don’t want to say we can’t learn things from them because we can. Like, HubSpot’s amazing. And I know we learned a lot about marketing, inbound marketing SEO from them, but I think it can be dangerous to look at a company like Notion and GitHub and say, well, if they’re doing it, then I also am going to have a free plan or a $4 a month plan because you don’t know how their economics are actually working. And if you don’t have the dual funnel, but at the same time, I’m not saying don’t do it, but I’m saying SignWell and Castos both have plans that are, well, yours I think starts at $12 a month and Castos lowest I think is $19 a month. So it’s somewhere around 20.  Ruben Gamez:We’re 10 and eight.  Rob Walling:10 and eight. All right. So low and that’s per seat. So feasibly if one person’s there. But yeah, this is very much low. You need a lot of customers to make it. But both of you have dual funnels and Castos has higher end hosting, but they also have the Castos Productions, the editing service that I think in production service it’s 500 to a thousand or 2000 a month. And SignWell, you have your API. We’ve talked about it on the show.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, even on the core side, we have just companies with a lot of users that we sell into.  Rob Walling:And so, I don’t want to speak for you, but my guess is if we looked at the amount of MRR that comes from $10 plans for you and the amount of MRR that comes from people paying you a hundred and up or 500 and up, that it’s probably significantly more that are in that latter bucket. Is that right?  Ruben Gamez:Funny enough, it is actually weirdly, and I say weirdly because it’s usually not the case, equally distributed.  Rob Walling:Is it continuing to be that or is one catching up and out running the other, or do you think it’ll stay 50-50? Because you’re right, that is very-  Ruben Gamez:We are really strong on the lower end. So they’re growing kind of equally, the now, especially on the API side, that’s starting to increase. But yeah, it is a bit of a weird distribution because that’s typically not how it plays out.  Rob Walling:So listeners and Francesco, if I were thinking about this, just to be clear, most of, I have insight into a hundred ninety-something companies and most of the companies with this type of dual funnel, we have either free on the bottom end or super cheap, and then you have people paying you 500, a thousand, 2000 and up, they make the bulk of their revenue. Oftentimes it’s 70, 80% of their MRR comes from the higher end, sometimes more than that, to be honest. So if Francesco’s talking about that, about a GitHub, Notion type thing, and oh, my guess is too, I don’t know, is GitHub public? Because we could look at their S one and figure out where their revenue actually comes from.  Ruben Gamez:I feel like they are, but I’m not sure yet.  Rob Walling:And Dropbox is the same way where it’s like, oh, they’re like a B2C player, aren’t they? No. Have you ever looked at how much all their revenue is business? Not all, but you get the idea. So if I were to put that in context then, as Francesco’s thinking about prosumers, can you have these $4 plans, $10 plans, $20 plans? Yes. But if I were going to do it and I wanted to actually build a great business, I would make sure that this product that serves Prosumers also has an enterprise customer base, an enterprise use case and enterprise and by enterprise look, mid-market, whatever, 500 and up, 300 and up, like some number. I don’t literally mean enterprise because that’s actually massive contracts, but that’s where it can be dangerous to assume that since GitHub and Notion are doing something that I can do that too without knowing that the second part, which is, but you also need the high end. Because if there’s no use case for them, if you’re building something for individual fitness trainers for five bucks or 10 bucks, I don’t know. Are there places that are large enough that will pay you $2,000 a month for the same software if there’s team functionality? That’s the question. That’s the kind of thinking that I’d be looking at if I were thinking about this kind of business.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I agree. The Notion and GitHub, somebody, I think it was like, was a podcast from Brian Balfour, I forget its name. They were talking about like a lot of these businesses that seem like they’re B2C or seem like they’re lean consumer, they’re actually enterprise or enterprisey businesses. That’s where most of the money comes from.  Rob Walling:That’s what we see too. Well, sir, it’s been amazing having you on the show today. If folks want to keep up with what you’re up to, they can see your spicy hot trolley takes on Twitter at Earthlingworks, and of course, signwell.com for the best electronic signature app on the market. Thanks so much for joining me.  Ruben Gamez:Great being here. Thanks.  Rob Walling:Thank again to Ruben for joining me on the show again this week. Hope that was insightful and helpful. There were actually, I really did like the listener questions this week, especially that first one. There’s a reason I let it go 15, 16 minutes because there was a lot to talk about there. Thanks for listening this week and every week.

I’m Rob Walling, and today I go through listener questions and listener comments. I received several comments regarding episode 704 where someone had written in with the question, “I really like my day job. I don’t have a burning desire to be an entrepreneur, but I would like to be one. Do you have advice for me?” And I gave advice like, well, I had a burning desire and most of the entrepreneurs, actually all the entrepreneurs I know who’ve had success, had that burning need to do it. So if there’s a listener out there who is struggling with that motivation or who didn’t have a bunch of motivation and found success, please write in. I also said maybe just try some things and if you get lucky, great, and if not, it’s a win-win because you can keep the day job. So I have responses to that as well as a couple comments about the now infamous April Fools episode. And of course I’m going to answer listener questions. Stay tuned. Before we dive into that, you should check out MicroConf Connect at microconfconnect.com. This is our online community and forum. We host it in Slack and we’re approaching 7,000 members. They’re bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. Recent conversations in Connect including a debate about magic sign-in links, how long you should spend diving into a niche before deciding on the product offer, how to safeguard your product from misuse during free trials, at what point in your journey should you invest in a conference booth and more. It’s a vibrant and highly moderated community, very high signal to noise. If you’re looking to find and hang out with other misfits like you and I, head to microconfconnect.com. So to kick us off, I received a response to that episode, 704, around do you need a burning desire in order to be successful? And this first one, I’m going to keep anonymous. He wrote a really well-written and well-thought-out lengthy email, so I’m going to summarize it. He says, “That caller’s question really resonated with me, and I kept pushing the rewind button on my walk and listening to that snippet over and over. It’s just one data point, but I believe I support your general experience with startup founders. I’m a previously bootstrapped founder with a successful exit through a strategic acquisition.” And in summary, he and a co-founder built an app that they sold for 10 times ARR. And it’s a life-changing amount of money, but it’s not enough money that he never has to work again. And so he said, “It’s been hard for me personally post exit, trying to find my place again. I’m consulting 20 hours a week making great money, so I’m fortunate, but I’m also kind of miserable because,” and I like this quote, in quotes, “my volume is turned down to a two like you mentioned.” So I must have … maybe I said that in the episode. I know that as an entrepreneur, the volume’s always at, what, 11? And then you go get a day job. I remember 15 years ago or whatever, I would be consulting or I’d be launching products and it was super exciting, but it was super frustrating and scary and uncertain. And then I would say, “I want to go back and get a day job.” And I would get a day job and I would be so bored and so frustrated. And so I think that perfectly encapsulates that my volume was turned down to a two. And so back to the email, “I have another bootstrapped product that I’m spinning up and I have multiple other opportunities, but I haven’t committed to any of them. I desperately miss shipping valuable products to users, that dopamine hit. I want to fly again and have that feeling of same day turnaround fixes for users, new features to solve real problems, et cetera. I’ve considered going back to a day job, but instead I think I’m going to use this time to hit it harder on my startup projects while I’m consulting part-time.” And then he wraps up with very kind sentiment, “I hope you get some level of satisfaction from how life-changing your podcast is on so many levels. For every person who writes you, there’s probably 20 others you don’t even know about.” That is actually very meaningful to me. So thanks, Anonymous, I really appreciate the insight. And he’s basically talking about without the motivation, it’s been really hard to get back in the game. And I think that can be a second-time entrepreneur, or if you have a great day job that you love, it can be hard to find the motivation to do the grind. So thanks so much for writing in. The next email is on the same topic and it’s from Paul. Paul: Hey Rob,  I’m a co-founder at WonderProxy, and a scatter-shot listener to Startups For the Rest of Us. WonderProxy has been around for over a decade now, we do over a million dollars a year in sales, full time staff beyond the founders. We’re doing okay. Back in episode 704 you had a question from someone with a comfortable job who wasn’t sure about making the leap. You talked a bunch about the burning desire or need, and wondered if it was a requisite for starting this sort of thing. I don’t think my co-founder or I ever really had a “burning desire”, neither of us is particularly passionate about the space. We help people test their website from around the world, we’re not curing cancer. I think we had two things going for us that let this work for us. First, we both loved building things: I’ve loved programming since childhood, my co-founder has loved working on servers since college. Working on the company was something we liked doing in our spare time. I was excited to come home from work and keep programming. Second, 0ur day jobs could give us the space to let the company grow at its own pace. We didn’t have a full time employee for the first five years. New customers let us expand the service, or pay ourselves some amount of money. So there wasn’t any passion or burning desire, but there also wasn’t any pressure. Our day jobs paid us well. The company grew slowly over a period of years until we made our first hires. Then, things accelerated and I eventually went full time, but was able to do so without risking my salary (which was handy, by that point I had a kid and a mortgage). My suggestion for your listener would be to find a problem out there they think they can solve by doing something they enjoy. Stick that solution out there, and invest just bits of money and time into it. In my view the super power that comes with this approach is that giving some change (like a new landing page, or ad copy, or whatever) a month or two to work is easy (You’re busy at work!). Where fully invested founders act like hampsters on speed, changing things daily, never giving their product enough time to actually see results. Hope this helps them, thanks, can’t wait for the next episode.Rob Walling:Ooh, see? I actually want to dive in here. I didn’t say a burning desire about the space, I said a burning desire for freedom, or a burning desire to be an entrepreneur or to start your own company or to own your own thing. That’s the burning desire I had. Many of the early products that I owned, I didn’t necessarily care about the space, but there were opportunities for me to make enough money to quit the day job. And I felt as long as I did that ethically in a way that provided value for what people were paying for that that was fine.  So thanks for writing in. I think it’s an interesting take and I do think that it’s an example of folks who put it on autopilot. Now do I think you’re less likely to find success that way? I do. I think that if you’re driving day-to-day and you have this burning desire to get to some end result, he’s right, you are a hamster on speed, but that can be beneficial when you’re an entrepreneur and when you’re trying to get to an end goal. And do I think you flail a bit and you probably waste some cycles? Probably. But do I think that focusing on a product and … I did at nights and weekends. So I worked a 40 hour a week day job and then depending on the week, and it was before we had a kid. And then after we had a kid, it might be between eight and 20 hours of nights and weekends that I could put in. And of course that was not getting enough sleep and it was not working out. It was doing all the things that you don’t want to do. But that allowed me to start building up side-income to the point where I actually did back off to four days a week at my day job. And I think in the end I was working three days a week, so like 24 hours a week and building products on the side. And so I love the fact that folks wrote in with their experience and I really appreciate their thoughts. My next email is on the same episode, but it’s on the ideal or the right trademark tech stack. And Daniel writes in, “When I started working on Codelantis, which is a code review app, I chose a tech stack that I knew and that is reasonably scalable, front and back end in different languages. Only later I realized this wasn’t an ideal choice.” “The best choice for an early stage product like mine is one that lets you iterate quickly and easily. I’ve switched to a single language repository,” so for him it’s TypeScript and Node.js, “a couple months back and the difference in development pace is like night and day, which also means that I’m not only shipping faster, but that my motivation stays up too. And this is arguably even more important for a nights and weekends project.” “So my TL;DR is don’t worry about scalability, worry that you can’t iterate fast enough, lose motivation, and no one will be using your product.” So thanks for writing in with that, Daniel. I think you need to worry about both. I don’t think I agree you don’t have to worry about scalability. There’s this weird balance of back in the day when I was a contractor writing code for third parties, some of our developers on my team would, we call it gold plating, and it’s over-engineering everything. And they would say, “Well, it’s for this big bank and maybe they’ve got a kajillion users.” And we had to have a balance. We couldn’t fall over when there were five users, but we couldn’t plan for five million, and we had to have a reasonable, pragmatic approach to making these things work. And I think picking your tech stack is similar, have a reasonable pragmatic approach. Will it scale well enough and will you be able to iterate quickly? I know that there are tech stacks that can do both, and I already weighed in on this whole topic. I appreciate Daniel’s insights on choosing the right tech stack. All right, so the April Fool’s episode, I have received more tweets, DMs, and emails about that episode than perhaps any other episode in the history of the podcast, so I really appreciated it. I did not think it would get that kind of response. I will give you some inside baseball that I had a real difficult time recording that episode because if you know me, I tend to be what? Pragmatic, logical, I tend to tell the truth. I try to tell you how I actually feel about things. If I don’t know the answer, I try to say, “I don’t know.” If I’m pretty certain about something, I try to say, “90, 95% certain.” And to say something that is just not what I believe and to actually steel man the arguments was challenging for me. I don’t think I’ve ever done this before, but I came into my office, I didn’t hit record, and I just recorded the whole episode without recording it. I just did a monologue in my office to figure out am I capable of doing this episode with a straight face? I did the whole thing and I thought, “You know what? That wasn’t that bad.” So then I hit record and recorded it. I still struggled when I listened back. I can hear myself acting a little bit, but it’s so cool that it didn’t come across like that for most people. So people were shocked. What I really appreciated were folks who wrote in and said, “You had me until you said this.” And for some people I think like Derrick Reimer said, “The moment you said that, I’ve rethought my stances based on thoughtful conversations on Twitter and Hacker News, I knew this was bull (beep). And Ruben Gamez, who has been a many-time guest on the show said, “The moment you talked about lowering prices, I was like, ‘Ah, he’s making it up. And this is a special episode, it’s got to be April Fool’s.'” He knew it right away. Most people, it seemed to take five to seven minutes. I think the entire diatribe was about 11 minutes before I gave it away. So a lot of people made it halfway through. And one such listener, Jakob Ericsson wrote in and said, “At first I was all for it, ‘Hell yeah, finally Rob is seeing it my way with consumers being great evangelists for products, B2C is fun.’ Then I started thinking, ‘Hey, he’s really having second thoughts on a lot of things. I wonder what people will think about being told things in such a convinced tone when it’s really the opposite of previous talking points. Churn is a good thing now?’ That broke the illusion for me.” Yeah, it was either churn or two-sided marketplaces. There were certain points that just became kind of ridiculous. So I appreciate you being a good sport if you listened to the episode and liked it and reached out. I haven’t done an April Fool’s episode in I believe six or seven years, so I felt like it was time to do it. All right, now let’s dive into a listener question from Mike. Mike says, “I started a company last year to address a sell shovels dev tools problem for this AI wave. I’m getting a consistent message about the features users need for me to be a viable option. My only pre-existing competitor has begun building for this use case and a new VC-funded competitor has entered the race. Realistically, there will be more coming.” “I take the competition as a sign I identified a real need, but I have strong doubts I’m going to be able to compete given how the ecosystem is shaping up. It’s a challenging problem in a complex and ever-evolving space. Lacking funding, revenue, and co-founders, my options seem limited. How should I handle this situation?” Yeah, so this is the double-edged sword of entering a, quote, unquote, “hot” space is, it’s inevitable if you’re in a space with a lot of opportunities growing quickly that a bunch of venture dollars are going to get poured into it. That doesn’t mean you’re going to lose, it’s just going to make it harder. I talk a lot about this in Start Small, Stay Small and probably should have talked a little more about it in The SaaS Playbook to be honest. But in The SaaS Playbook, I talk about why niches and verticals are usually so much better for solopreneurs who want to lifestyle it. A big mistake I see folks making is thinking I can build a venture-scale business or I can build a business that will probably need a lot of funding, but I can just bootstrap it. Or I can build in a market where there’s going to be a ton of funding and probably just bootstrap it. And while it’s possible, the odds are stacked against you. And so if it’s your first time, you can either do the step one business or you can restart small, stay small and look for out-of-the-way niches where no venture money is going to enter it. And am I saying go somewhere where there’s no competition? Of course not because there probably doesn’t exist a market of any size at this point that you can launch a software product into. But this is the double-edged sword of oh, there’s opportunity and there’s a bunch of people talking about it, therefore there’s going to be a kajillion dollars brought into it. Now can you still win? Can you still beat venture-funded competitors? Of course. If you know what you’re doing and you’re experienced, I would compete against venture-funded competitors. In fact, I did. Drip was, what, the 300th email marketing application? And our competitors who, I think VentureBeat did a top 10 marketing automation providers, maybe it was top 15, and we were number, I honestly forget the number, 10 or 11, and everyone ahead of us had raised a minimum of $20 million. Some had raised hundreds of millions and yet there we were in a little closet in Fresno, California at the time with five employees just scrapping. So yes you can, but I was an experienced entrepreneur. I had put 150 to $200,000 of my own money from my other projects into building it. I knew what I was doing, I had a network, I had an audience, I had blah, blah, blah. I had all these unfair advantages and if you don’t have that, it really becomes an uphill battle. So back to Mike’s question, how should I handle this situation? There’s a bunch of things you could do. You could look to get acquired. You could throw your flag out. Now here’s the thing, you’re going to get acquihired. They’re going to want to hire you as an engineer, probably pay you a bunch in stock, but if you can get … I saw someone who had 70K ARR, maybe it was 75, and they got acquired for 10X ARR. So they got three quarters of a million dollars for a fairly early stage product. If you don’t have that kind of money in the bank and that is life-changing for you and you have to work for a year or two in order to get it, I don’t know, that’s something I would have done in my younger years. So in thinking about acquihire, often that can cut both ways. It can be a good deal or it can be a crappy deal. You mentioned you have no revenue, which I think that’s probably the biggest problem here, is if you’re going to build, if you’re going to bootstrap, please go towards revenue. Don’t do the free plan. And if you’re entering a space where everyone has a free plan and therefore you need it to compete, think twice about whether or not you want to bootstrap in that space. I feel like a lot of folks, I’m not saying Mike’s doing this, but I do see folks entering these hot spaces and not realizing that the competition is stacked against them if they don’t have revenue co-founders and funding. So anyways, back to my answer. You could look to get acquired, which is harder than it sounds because if you go out looking to get acquired, then you look desperate and people are going to want to not pay you very much. But build and get on the radars, and if they approach you, you say, “I’m not really looking to get acquired really early, but sure I’m open to talking about it.” You play coy and then you go along with it as it evolves. Another thing you could do is just walk away, do something else. You could take what you have and focus on a vertical where there isn’t necessarily VC dollars. I don’t know. Without knowing a bit more about your space, I don’t know if there’s a vertical or a way that you can position down and take a corner of the market that they are not going to go after, but that your tech can translate to really easily. So to make up an example, instead of building the AI CRM for everyone, you build the AI CRM for realtors or for freelancers or for salespeople at SaaS companies. You get the idea. Another option is to go raise funding, fight fire with fire. And either go to something like a TinySeed, go out and try to raise angel money, go try to raise venture. If venture’s going into the space, it’s not as hard as you think to be able to raise funding. And yes, gasp, Startups For the Rest of Us, Rob the bootstrapping podcaster talking about raising venture funding. Well, I’ve been saying that for 15 years. It’s just a tool and if you need that tool to succeed in your space, then of course I would consider raising it. You have a big decision to make, Mike. Obviously this is a tough choice with a lot of things at play, and of course it depends on the specifics. I can’t even say, usually I say in your shoes, here is what I’d do. And really without knowing all the details and just sitting down and talking about the ins and outs for 30 minutes, 45 minutes, I don’t know that I could even weigh in on what I would do in your situation. But I hope all the options I’ve laid out for you are helpful. Thanks for writing in. Our next question is from Reid Alexander, subject line is, “Is Learning to Code Dead?” Reid writes, “Hey, Rob. Thanks for putting in all the work making Startups For the Rest of Us a great show. My favorites are the listener question episodes, which is why I’m writing. I’m currently in the process of selling my small online business with the hopes of further exploring the ins and outs of software development after its sells. I’m extremely novice when it comes to programming, so I’ve been looking for the best ways to quickly learn what I need to know to develop software myself thinking of becoming a full stack developer.” “So I guess my question is in three parts. Number one, is learning to code still relevant?” Yes, it is still relevant. I view AI as augmentation, like a little bit of a co-pilot is a great example. Having a co-pilot, having something that does autopilot, you still need humans involved to fly an airplane. So is it still relevant? Yes. Do I believe it will still be relevant in 5, 10, 15 years? Yes, people will still be making software. Now we may not be making software in the way that we do today, much like if we flash back to the ’50s. Now, I think in the ’40s, you would program a computer by moving vacuum tubes. And then eventually we got the integrated circuit, which was what, the ’50s or the ’60s. You’ll have to forgive even though I have a degree in computer engineering, I do not remember my history of how computers evolved. But I think it was in the ’60s we had the integrated circuit and therefore programming became typing ones and zeros, literally binary. Then there was assembly language, which were these short, usually three letter instructions that would generate the binary. And at that time people said, “Well, it’s going to be slow. Well, you’re not going to need programmers anymore because everyone’s going to be able to do assembly language.” And if you’ve ever seen assembler, it is an absolute nightmare to work with. And then it goes on and it’s like, well, C is a higher level language. Well, now everybody’s going to be able to program. And then they build C++ and then they build Ruby on top of that, and then they build whatever else. They build no-code on top of that. It’s all code. And at every movement, at every big shift, when those new languages came out, people would say, “Well, now you can just type human English instructions into a computer and it’ll just do the thing, and so we’re not going to need developers.” I see AI as the same thing. It’s another abstraction layer, it’s another augmentation layer, but there are still going to be brilliant developers, brilliant makers, brilliant product people who are better than others at it. Do I think it makes it easier to get on board and easier to learn? Probably. Do I think it makes it easier to be a crappy developer and build things that are not going to scale and that are going to break and that are going to have bugs? Yeah, probably. So is learning to code still relevant? In my opinion, 100%, yes. It’s going to change, but it’s still relevant. “Number two, if it is still relevant, which I believe to be the case,” the OP is saying, “what’s the best way to go about learning to code in a shorter period of time? With all the new tools, like ChatGPT, Replit,” which I haven’t heard of, “et cetera, is learning the traditional way, a waste of time?” I don’t know what the traditional way is because coming up, I read books. I was eight years old, there was a book called How to Speak BASIC to My Apple. I read that, I learned how to speak BASIC to my Apple. So is that traditional? Is going to four years of university traditional? I certainly don’t think that’s the way to code by the way, much cheaper, much faster ways. Is going to an online coding boot camp traditional? Is going to an in-person coding school traditional? Probably not, those things are newer. And then there’s also sites like Boot.dev and Frontend Mentor, which is, Frontend Mentor’s a TinySeed company, Boot.dev, Lane, the founder, was on this podcast just, I don’t know, in the last six months. I would say, which way do you learn the best? Any of those ways can work. If you learn from books, which most people don’t. For some reason I did, and I don’t know why, but I guess it was because it was the only way I had. Imagine me, eight years old in the 1980s trying to learn to code. It’s like, what were my options? There was no internet, there were no online coding schools. And it was intriguing to me that you could type something and a computer would do it. And I was like, “Well, I’m the youngest of four kids and everyone orders me around. I want to order something around.” So I learned how to speak BASIC to my Apple to do it. And then as time went on, there were in-person schools, in essence there were trade schools. But then there were even just these in-person boot camps where you can go for six weeks or six months and learn the basics. Figure out what modality works for you. If you’re the person who needs to go somewhere and be sitting there to not be distracted, then look locally. If you can do it online, that’s probably cheaper and you can probably find a better school because you have the whole world now as your option. Or again, Boot.dev, Frontend Mentor, there are a kajillion of those online. I think those are two good ones that I know about, but there are probably at least 50 more sites that can help gamify it and help you learn how to do it. That’s how I would think about it. Tools like ChatGPT are just augmentation. ChatGPT in my opinion, is not going to teach me how to code. It’s not designed to do that. But can it help me as I go along? It’s like I remember at a certain point in either high school or college, they allowed us to start using calculators. And they just said, “Look, doing basic math isn’t the thing anymore.” But when you’re in fourth grade through eighth grade, it’s like, “Well, you have to learn to do the math so that you know it.” At a certain point, they were just like, “Take the calculator and use it to do the basic math because the hard part is figuring out the geometry or the equations or which equation to use or how to do something that’s a higher level function.” And that’s how I see ChatGPT, it’s like the calculator. It’s just a little assistant that can help you if you get stuck. It can write a bit of code for you and it may or may not work, and you need to know how to debug that and integrate it into a core application that’s actually going to make sense. “And the third part of the question is are there certain languages or specifics I should focus on learning to become a full-stack developer who can create my own software and web applications, hopefully utilizing LLM within my projects? Thanks for all the advice you give and have a great week, Reid.” So are there certain languages? I mean, we talked a little bit about this, right? A lot of people use Node. We just heard someone write in and say, “I want it to be all JavaScript, therefore I only have to learn one language and I use some type of JavaScript framework on the front with Node on the back.” People build startups out of that. If I were to start today, I would probably go with Ruby on Rails or Python Django. I know another really popular one is PHP Laravel and there are these amazing SaaS starter kits that, again, I talked about these a couple episodes ago. I don’t want to rehash all that, but that’s what I would do. And maybe go to Stack Overflow or to Reddit or Quora and just Google this exact question and look to see what people are saying and just make a call. The thing is learning one language allows you to then learn other languages a lot easier. And I know switching ecosystems, it can be a pain. But I was teaching myself Python three or four years ago just for fun on weekends because I had never coded in it. And I knew PHP and I had seen Ruby on Rails because it was what drove Drip, but I was never able to code in it. But I was like, “Python seems pretty elegant and I really liked the ideas behind Django and it seems like you could get something going pretty quick.” And I was going to start building just some basic web apps to do whatever crazy things and I wanted to get into a little bit … This is before the LLMs come around. But I liked the idea of semantic analysis and such, and I was like, “Who has the best libraries for semantic analysis?” It was Python. And so, literally in a weekend, now I have an advantage of course, because I used to be a developer so I could translate the paradigms. But that’s what I’m saying here is if you pick one that’s generally accepted and a bunch of web apps are built in and then later you realize, you know what? I really should have picked this other one, it’s like making that transition is a transition, but it’s not as painful as just getting started. So thanks so much for those questions, Reid. I hope that was helpful. I do not believe learning to code is dead. Let me just underline that. People say this for the sensational headline of it to get clicks and stuff. Will it change? Yes. Will driving change as self-driving cars come around? Yes. Did making garments change when the automated loom was invented? Yes. Did transportation change when cars were invented? Yes, but it’s like these are all advancements in technology that we can work with that make our lives better, make us more productive. And as long as we aren’t acting like an ostrich with our head in the sand imagining, “Oh, it isn’t coming, I’m not going to update my skills. No, I’m just going to be the same old developer I always have been.” Well, then I think you probably have a problem because there is a paradigm shift occurring right now. It’s like some of the developers in the early 2000s who I knew who were either desktop developers or they were still developing in COBOL and just older systems and didn’t want to learn even Perl or ASP or PHP stuff that was really evolving in the early 2000s. And I was like, “Look, that’s your choice, but realize there will be fewer and fewer jobs for you in the coming decades if you don’t update your skills.” My last question for today is from Patrick Bowman. Patrick asked about product protection, “When developing and researching a SaaS product, what is the risk of potential IP theft?” So the idea of someone stealing your intellectual property. “On a scale from 1 to 100, where would you rate this as a concern? Would you recommend an NDA or similar for the early adopters or testers who are testing a SaaS product? How would you recommend founders and developers protect their product if it is a substantial concern?” So here’s the thing, an idea for a product is not IP or it’s not something that you can protect against. Copyright protects the actual code. Trademark protects your mark that you’re using in trade, so your logo and the name. And patents can protect the specific way that you’re doing something. I’m looking at a patent law here. But realistically, if I come up with an idea for an app that does exactly some very specific AI thing for realtors and someone comes along and mostly replicates the exact same interface and tries to compete with me, unless I have deep pockets, you send them a cease and desist and they can ignore you. And what are you going to do, sue them? Again, unless you have deep pockets, IP protection is actually very, very hard. It’s a lot more complicated than people think. There’s difference between law and justice and when people have copied me, I’m always like, “(beep) this sucks.” It’s not just. But can I go after someone who recorded a YouTube video and basically used the same outline I did? Probably not. I mean, I could try, but is there any … Do I want to go to court and spend years and tens of thousands of dollars to try to get someone’s YouTube video taken down?” It’s just not worth it. And so what I thought this question was going to be about is people you hire to actually write the code for you, and of course you should have them sign an IP agreement they’re not going to steal your stuff. That’s just law. If they’re overseas, so you have a developer in the Philippines and they decide to steal it and try to compete with you, well, that sucks. Are you going to sue him in a Filipino court? It’s like there are risks you have to take I think with this kind of stuff. On a scale from 1 to 100, where would I rate this as a concern, especially with early adopters or testers who are testing a SaaS product? I don’t think I’ve ever thought about it. So it’s like if I say it’s a one, does that mean it never happens? Certainly it’s happened. It has to have happened, I just don’t hear about it. I talk to TinySeed companies, I talk to MicroConf companies, I talk to listeners of this podcast, see people at events. Every once in a while I’ll hear, “Oh, an employee took a piece of our code and went and did X, Y, Z and tried to compete with us.” It does happen now and again, but for me personally, it’s just not something I have ever been concerned about. I feel like if my customers are a bunch of indie makers or indie hackers who are really scraping looking for an idea, then yeah, maybe I’d have them sign an NDA. I am not sure how I would enforce that. But if my customers or early adopters or testers are realtors or lawyers, do I think that they’re going to go try to build a software product to compete with me? No. Could it happen? Yes. Is it likely to? I don’t think so. It’s just one of these things. It’s, as you’re saying, I like that you said 1 to 100 because it really is risk tolerance. It’s like at this point you have testers and early adopters. Do you also have general liability insurance or errors and omissions insurance at this point? Well, why not? Because isn’t there a risk that your software could do something, someone could sue you around the software? Of course, but the risk right now is astronomically low. So you’re not going to spend the time or the money worrying about it. I think similarly, do you have an LLC or a C corp set up so that you are not personally liable if anything happens to the software? You might, but a lot of people don’t. I didn’t have an LLC for the first five years of … I had all these products. This was from ’02 to ’07, 2007. I was a freelancer, I was a contractor and I was making money from software products, six figures from all this stuff. And I was still a sole proprietorship, meaning someone totally could have sued me personally for any of this. And for me it was just not worth the headache to get that corporate entity set up and to get all the stuff set up. And so am I saying everyone should follow my path? Well, of course not. But on a scale of 1 to 10 or 1 to 100, I guess as you said, it’s very low. It’s very low on my list to be honest. And the third part was how would you recommend founders and developers protect their product if it is a substantial concern? I guess not showing it to people that I was concerned about. I guess having them sign an NDA. That’s it. I mean, that’s what an NDA is for. You can’t take this and do anything with it. You can’t even tell people about it. That’s it. Yeah, I don’t know where else to go with it other than that’s what NDAs are designed for. And if people don’t sign NDAs, you’re going to let them check out your product? I guess that’ll be your choice if you think it’s a substantial concern. Typically, this is more of a concern that’s in people’s head than it is in reality. So thanks for that question, Patrick. I hope it was helpful. Thank you for joining me today. If you have a question for the show, you want to hear me or me and a guest answer it in a future episode, you can email questions@startupsfortherestofus.com and you can send a Dropbox link to an MP3 file or a video file, you can attach an audio file. Or you can go to startupsfortherestofus.com, click Ask a Question in the top nav, and then you can record right there on your phone or on your computer, send in video, audio. They always go to the top of the stack, except for … I say always. Most of the time they go to the top of the stack. Every once in a while I dig through the text questions because I still have a question from June of last year. So we are, what is that? 10 months. I’m starting to feel guilty a little bit, and I did go through several text questions today. But as a rule, the video and the audio are the ones that go to the top of the stack. One of the reasons for that, it’s just really cool to hear from people in the community and to know that there are other humans listening to this podcast. Because if you’re listening to it solo, do you know how many listeners there are? Are there five listeners? Are there 50,000 listeners? When you start hearing people writing in with their own concerns and you hear their voice and you hear the intonation of the question, there’s just so much more fidelity to that experience than it is sending a text question in and me reading it. Of course, still send text questions in if you want to.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and every week on this show, I talk about building an incredible life through startups. Usually, it’s bootstrapping and mostly bootstrapping. Sometime, I have venture-funded startups come on and talk about their experience. But realistically, it’s all about founders, humans that are trying to make a difference in their lives and the lives of the folks around them. Entrepreneurship has been the number one force in my life that has changed it for the better. It brought me from making $4 and 50 cents an hour at my first job and $17 an hour in my first job out of college to where I am today, in a position where finances are no longer a major concern in my life. And that feels like a very weird thing to say based on where I came from. So in today’s episode, I’m going to talk about building wealth, and specifically, I’m going to talk a bit about my story, the story of Sherry and I building wealth over the past 20-something years. And I’m going to talk about the activities we’ve done in order that have brought us the most wealth in our lives. And I realize that talking about money can be a taboo subject. I’ve never been someone to share my MRR and act like I’m building in public when in fact, I’m actually bragging in public. But I do think that many of us who are out to find freedom, purpose, and relationships, we need to find a way to make enough money to quit the day job or to augment our day job or at a certain point, to make enough money that we never have to work again. Because as much as most of us will say, “I don’t actually care about the money, I care about the freedom,” the money is the means to that end, the money is the means to get to freedom. Before we dive into that, you should check out, MicroConf Connect at microconfconnect.com. This is our online community and forum. We host it in Slack and we’re approaching 7,000 members. They’re bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. Recent conversations in Connect, including a debate about magic sign-in links, how long you should spend diving into a niche before deciding on the product offer, how to safeguard your product from misuse during free trials. At what point in your journey should you invest in a conference booth and more. It’s a vibrant and highly moderated community. Very high signal-to-noise if you’re looking to find and hang out with other misfits like you and I, head to Microconfconnect.com. Let’s dive in to a lesson on how to build wealth. And look, I could say how to get rich. That’s the gauche way of saying it, but I feel like there a way to talk about this topic tactfully and to talk about it respectfully and to talk about it frankly, with grace and thanks because if nothing else, I have an incredible amount of gratitude for what entrepreneurship has done in my life and the life of my family, and that’s why I want to share this with you today. So last week, I was on Twitter and I saw a tweet from Christopher cgimmer and he said, “My two greatest investments, number one, starting a business, number two, buying Bitcoin.” And that tweet reminded me of an essay, really a half-form blog post that I wrote a year, maybe two years ago. I thought of turning it into a tweet thread. I thought of posting it on the blog and just never did. But it was a reflection on the life that Sherry and I have built. And I started thinking through what are the ways that we lifted ourselves up from, I’ll say, humble beginnings. I won’t go into it too far, but between Sherry’s family and my family, we have convicted felons, we have drug addicts, we have folks who have been on food stamps, some folks who are still on food stamps. We’ve had people in and out of jail, we have alcoholics, we have a lot of stuff. And I’m not saying this to play the politician role of, oh, look at the humble beginnings we came from. But in all honesty, where we are today is a far cry from where we started. And the number one reason for that is entrepreneurship. Now, obviously you could say, well, Sherry and I would’ve been okay even without entrepreneurship, and maybe we would have, we were working salary jobs before I started companies, and could we have built a great life, just the two of us working hard as salaried employees? Of course we could have. So I don’t want to sit here and act like entrepreneurship is the only reason that we’re alive today and the only reason we own a home or anything like that, because salary employment and investing in the stock market was the path that we were taking, and we were doing fine. We were certainly middle class and doing well. But as we look at this list of things that allowed us to build wealth, you’ll notice that entrepreneurship is number one, spoiler. But a bunch of the other ones came because entrepreneurship made enough money that then we could take several bets on different things that we wouldn’t have been able to if we didn’t have that money in the bank. I’m going to be honest, I was actually a bit surprised as I ran through this list. I’d never really thought about it before and to look at which activity contributed cash in what order was pretty fascinating to me. So in this episode, I’m going to walk through seven wealth creators, and this is not investment advice. Think of it more as a story. The story of Sherry and I coming out of college with 100, $200 in a bank account and building what I feel like is a pretty successful life that I’m very grateful for. And there was a ton of hard work, nights and weekends constantly for several years. I don’t do that anymore, but there’s probably six, seven years of basically clocking nights and weekends to start companies on the side as I was trying to figure it out. There was definitely some skill that Sheri and I built up through putting in the hours or through going to the library or through being on the internet and studying and learning. And obviously, there’s some luck involved as there always is. In addition, this is not investment advice. This is just the way that we think about allocating our money. And this may or may not work for you or even be relevant. So with that, first item on the list is selling companies. And for the most part it’s selling companies that we started from scratch. Sometimes it was selling companies that I acquired. So HitTail was a SaaS app that I bought in 2011 for $30,000, and by the time I sold it in 2015, the total revenue it generated plus the exit amount was just over $1 million. And one might say $1 million, Rob? That doesn’t sound like that much money. To us at that point in our lives, it was the first moment that we had life-changing money, “life-changing money,” not never have to work again, money, but it changed the way that we went about our day to day. It was the first time I ever saw $100,000 in a bank account, was working on HitTail. HitTail was highly profitable. It had a 90% gross. No, it had about an 85, maybe 90% net profit margin, net profit because it was just me and a couple contractors. And one might say, “Well, you had $30,000 to buy HitTail. I don’t have $30,000.” Guess what? Three years prior, I didn’t have $30,000 either, but I built businesses like .NET Invoice, I wrote Start Small Stay Small. I had a portfolio of small products and I saved the money from those as well as consulting that I was doing a few years prior to get that 30,000. So I truly stair-stepped my way up over the course of, depending on how you count, it was either six years or 11 years to get to that point where I could acquire a SaaS app and grow it. And I had built the skills to do that and I’d put in a lot of hard work along the way to be able to do it. Prior to that, I had, at any given time, I had around a dozen. It was like between nine and 12 small products doing hundreds to single digit thousands per month. And I cobbled those together to make a full-time living. And it was a great lifestyle. I worked 12 hours, 16 hours a week. We had young kids, but I was always worried that I wasn’t going to have revenue or income the next month or the next year. And I was constantly thinking about, am I going to have to go back and get a job? Am I going to have to go back to consulting? And once you taste the freedom of not doing those things, you really don’t want to go back. I became unemployable pretty quickly. Now, moving from that life-changing to sunset money where you can just ride off into the sunset. Some people call it FU money. You could say it’s never have to work again, money, but that of course was selling Drip. And one might say, “But Rob, you invested 150,000 or $200,000 into getting Drip built. So when you sold it for millions of dollars, I can’t do that because I don’t have 150 or $200,000.” Guess what? I didn’t either three years prior, but I bought HitTail for $30,000 and grew HitTail, which was doing, it was around $2,000 a month at the time. I grew it to 30,000 MRR and socked that money away in a bank account, put it away, put it away, put it away. So I had money in a business bank account to where I could pull that out and build Drip. This is why I get a little infuriated when I see comments, I’ll see them on the YouTube channel, for example, where I talk about if you have an unfair advantage, if you have an audience or if you have a network or if you have money, then use it. And someone will post a comment with, well, if I was lucky enough to have an audience like you, I didn’t build my audience because I was lucky. I built my audience because I’d put in almost 20 years of hard work. And I know people who build it a lot faster than that, but however many years you put in, it’s not luck, it’s about putting in hard work and reaping the rewards. And so I can imagine someone listening to this and say, “Well, I don’t have $150,000 to build Drip. I don’t have $30,000 to build HitTail. I don’t have $11,000 to buy .Net Invoice,” which is what I bought it for back in ’05, ’06. I didn’t either until I did freelance work on the side in addition to my day job and saved up enough money to buy .Net Invoice, and then parlayed .Net Invoice into money in the bank to buy HitTail and then parlayed that. You know what I mean? It’s like it took us a long time. If you think about it, the typical startup journey you hear about these days, “typical,” I’ll put in quotes, people say, “Oh, in three years I quit my job. In a year, I quit my job. In five years I became a millionaire.” I started building and trying to launch software products really around probably 2002, 2003, and I had my first thousand dollars revenue month in ’05, ’06. Think of how long that is. That’s a lot of nights and weekends, and it’s not what you see on Twitter today. It took us a long time because we had no backstop. We did not have parents who would bail us out if we went to zero, if we lost our apartment, if we didn’t have money to pay for it, we couldn’t move in with anybody. Not having a backstop makes it really scary and it can make you risk averse, which is what we were because we had to show up for our jobs every day and trade dollars for hours because we had to make a rent payment because we had no backstop. And so I did a talk several years back called 11 Years to Overnight Success, where I started the timer at 2005, which is around the time I acquired .Net Invoice and ended it in 2016, which is when we sold Drip. And that was the moment where I never had to work again. And it took us 11 years to get to that point. Why did it take so long? Because I stair-stepped, because I did it carefully and because we did it in a pretty risk-averse fashion such that we would never lose the house. We didn’t put a bunch of money on credit cards, we didn’t take out a second mortgage to invest in our business. You might be more risk-averse. In fact, you might have a backstop if you have rich parents, if you have $200,000 in the bank that you’ve earned and saved or that someone gave you, that’s amazing. Then you can take bigger risks and you can do it a lot faster than we did. But we took one step in front of the other and put in hard work, luck and skill over years. And frankly at this point, decades. When I say think in years not months, what I actually mean is think in decades, not years, but that would be too painful to tell people when they’re first starting out. So that was number one, selling companies. And I realized I included running HitTail, meaning taking profit off of it. So I muddied the waters a little bit. But realistically, the number one driver of wealth building for us has been exiting companies. And the beauty about selling is, at least in the US, the tax laws are so favorable because they give you long-term capital gains in your tax rate is far less than if you draw profits out of a business. In addition, depending on how you’re growing and what the multiples are, you can often sell for 10 years worth of net profit or 15 years worth of net profit. So you dramatically accelerate the amount of cash you get today, and that allows you to make other bets that may pay off for you as we did in 2016. You may not want to hear it, but number two on our list is cryptocurrency. And I know some people are cringing. I’m not a crypto bro, I’m not a crypto maximalist, but when I started hearing about crypto in let’s say 2014 or ’15, I was intrigued by it, but much like investing, I didn’t want to spend any time focusing on it because I was busy being an entrepreneur and I wanted to focus on growing a company. But after selling Drip in 2016, we obviously had a large sum of cash and I wanted that to last the rest of our lives. And a very interesting side effect of having a large amount of money is that you can make larger than sensible bets on very risky things. So prior to that, we had made a few angel investments, and of course, that’s lower here on the list, but we’d made some angel investments in startups. And I started thinking of crypto as an angel investment and I told Sherry, it’s either going to 100x or it’s going to go to zero. So let’s put an amount of money into crypto to where it goes to zero, it doesn’t matter to us. And here’s the thing, it comes back to entrepreneurship because if we hadn’t sold Drip, then could we have put $1,000 into crypto? Yeah, probably. And do I think putting 1% of your net worth or 2% or some very small amount into risky bets is a good thing? I do personally. In fact, we have done it with angel investments and with cryptocurrencies. Do I think everyone should do it? I don’t know, it depends on your risk tolerance, but to me, I saw what [inaudible 00:14:55] calls asymmetric upside, which is, if this can potentially 100x, could I put $1,000, $10,000, $50,000 into it? Well, it depends on how much you’re worth, right? If your entire net worth is $50,000, that would be foolish to put 50,000 in. But if you literally have millions and millions of dollars sitting in a bank account, is it foolish to put tens of thousands into something that could potentially be worth millions someday? Maybe. So is it super risky? Of course. But over the course of, I think it was seven months, eight months, we basically dollar cost averaged less than 1% of our net worth. So it was tens of thousands of dollars into several cryptocurrencies. This is ETH, it was Bitcoin, I think it was Litecoin at the time. I think I picked three or four. And again, it was either going to 100x or it was going to go to zero. And when I say dollar cost averaging, what that means is instead of buying a big chunk all at once, you buy a small amount every day, every week, every hour, whatever it is to get up to your target allocation. And I genuinely wrote it off, expected that money never to come back. Much like any angel investment check we write, I don’t include that in our net worth anymore. I consider that it’s zero until it’s not. And one could say, “Well, you got a little lucky.” Yeah, probably also could have bought two years later when it crashed. Also, could have bought a couple years after that when it crashed. But if you dollar cost average in and you don’t put any more in than you can lose. It just didn’t seem that risky. I’m pretty risk averse person. I’ve never had a backstop. And so for context, we started buying ETH around, I think it was somewhere between six and $10, and Bitcoin was at 600 or so. And obviously, as of this writing, they’re at 3300 and 66,000 respectively. Which just feels bizarre, right? Crypto to me was just a mechanism. It was just a thing that could go up. I have no desire to persuade you to purchase it, right? And I’ve gotten into discussions where people will ask the usual question, well, why is it valuable? Why not just buy gold, isn’t it a bubble? And it’s like, I don’t know. I just view it as an angel investment. It’s a lens of opportunity. And again, never could have done this without having the exit. And the interesting part about this is within months, it started going up, I think it was six or eight months, it started going up so quickly that actually, it scared me because it went from tens of thousands up literally into the single digit millions, and it became almost… It was like a fear of liability about the volatility. And so we started dollar cost averaging out as much as we could. Back then it was actually hard to sell crypto. There were all these limits on exiting, and that was a good thing because I think we would’ve sold more than probably would’ve been wise. We were held in by these limits, and those limits allowed us to leave more in, that then of course grew over the following five, six years. I just don’t think we would’ve kept it that long. So I’ve appreciated how those limits probably went against the scarcity mindset of, oh no, it’s going to go down and we’re going to “lose” a bunch of money even though we’re still playing with house money. So in the subsequent years, we have definitely sold seven figures, obviously playing with house money plus, plus, taking chips off the table, but still have enough that if it continues to go up, that we ride that wave as well. So what’s the learning there? Is it everyone should buy crypto? Is it everyone should dollar-cost average into risky assets? I think it’s that making money creates opportunity and allows you to make bets on things that otherwise you never could have. And again, this is where it comes back to entrepreneurship. We’ve been partnering with Lemon.io for several years and they’ve proven to be a great choice when it comes to hiring for a highly skilled developer to work on your project.

Number two, their developers have previously worked with tech Giants like Apple, Google, Netflix, Airbnb, Intel and Lego. Number three, they only provide senior devs with an average of seven years experience. Number four, their talent pool covers more than 300 dev languages and frameworks. And lastly, number five, your hire comes with a zero risk replacement guarantee. Customers of Lemon.io typically stick around for at least a year, proving, they know how to gain your trust by delivering consistent results.

As a bonus for our podcast listeners, you’ll get a 15% discount on your first four weeks of working with a developer at lemon.io/startups. That’s lemon.io/startups. Number three on this list is running profitable companies or owning profitable products. Some software, some knowledge products. So think of things like running HitTail, running my product portfolio back in the day. Dr. Sherry Walling, my wife runs Zen Founder, which is a very successful executive and start-up founder coaching practice zenfounder.com if you want to check that out. I had a micro agency back in the day. And of course, book sales, since we publish our own books, you can actually make decent money if you sell 20,000 copies like the SaaS Playbook has sold. There are no big hits in this one. This one is really number three on the list by virtue of how many years we’ve done them. Sherry has run Zen founder, I think since, I don’t know, maybe 2013, 2014, so a decade. And I ran HitTail for five years. It was highly profitable. The product portfolio was six, seven, eight years. Sherry’s written two books. I’ve written four books. Each of these things, we just have done them for a lot of years, so none of them was a breakaway, mad influx of cash, but each of these was either additive to our day jobs or it was a nice steady income stream to keep us going long enough to have some of the other big hits. Number four on the list is angel investing. And for a while, I’ll be honest, this was number two on the list, and this is mostly due to an angel investment that I was able to make in WP Engine. There are also a few startups we’ve invested in that have returned, I’ll say single digit multiples. So let’s say a 3x, a 4x, a 5x, which they’re nice, but they’re not the return that the WP Engine did. And we also have a couple that kick off dividends that again, are nice to haves, although we pay income tax on them. But realistically, the power law plays out here through my investments. Sharon and I have 20 plus angel investments on our own in addition to the ones through TinySeed. And when WP Engine had what I think was considered a private equity growth round in 2018 or ’19, we got bought out and that was enough money that we could pay cash for our next house, which we had to do because I didn’t have a job. I couldn’t get a loan because I didn’t have a job. Think about the irony of that. This was after selling Drip, but after having all this, but angel investing is another one that is 100x or go to zero. And any money that we’ve written, we’ve basically written off the moment we write the check. And again, someone might say, “Well, I can’t angel invest.” And it’s like, well, you got to make money first, right? We only were able to do it by building companies and having enough revenue that we had money in the bank that we could potentially invest. In addition, who invested in WP engine? Well, it was a handpicked list. It was oversubscribed. And Jason Cohen approached me and said, “If you want to invest, I’ll save money in the round for you.” Why did he do that? Because he had read my blog and he had read Start Small Stay Small, and he said, “I think you could advise me on virtual assistance and potentially email marketing and potentially SEO. These were things that he saw that I was knowledgeable in. So did I “earn” that? I don’t know. It was a combination of hard work because I put two to 400 hours into my blog every year between 2005 and 2011. A lot of times during lunch hours at my day job. When other people went out to lunch, I would go and I would write. So there was some hard work there. Was there luck? Absolutely. And was there skill? Yeah, it’s debatable, but that was the first angel check we ever wrote. In fact, we were not accredited investors. And so there’s a bit of luck there that he was willing to do what’s called a friends and family type situation. So I’m super grateful for Angel investing. Now, if we had never done angel investment, would we still be fine? Would we still be well off? Would we still have wealth? We would, but it’s that nice to have thing that allowed us to level up our standard of living. And to be honest, it’s just pretty fun. I love being involved in startups, as you can imagine, as my life’s mission is to multiply the number of independent self-sustaining startups in the world, and therefore, angel investing being number four on this list is apropos. Number five is salaried employment. This is working for other people. Both Sherry and I had many W-2 jobs in our lives. It’s the default. It’s what you do when you’re starting out, most of us. I kind of wished I was just a contractor freelancer when I started, but I was too risk-averse, and I wanted a steady paycheck to pay for that apartment that we lived in in Sacramento, California, where the rent was $720 a month for a two-bedroom place back in 2000. Nothing wrong with salaried employment. I learned so much. I really learned how to code as a salaried employer. I learned how to hire. I learned how to interview. I learned how to manage. I think folks who don’t have a salary job before they go out on our own are at a bit of a disadvantage if you haven’t learned those skills. So would I say you should get a salary job before going out on your own? I wouldn’t say that. Some people naturally can just do those things, are better at management, are better at hiring. They have the confidence, somehow they just figure it out. I was not one of those. I was very inexperienced. I was very timid. I was scared to do things like interview other people. I didn’t know how. And I learned those on the job and it made me a better entrepreneur once I decided to strike out on my own. Number six of seven is investing in what I’ll call typical investments like stocks, bonds, REITs, and so on. The challenge that we saw there was you need money to make money. You can put money away every month, which we were doing. Oh, hey, I’ll put $400 a month away, or $1000 a month at a certain point, or even $2,000 a month. And so in a year you save 6,000, 12,000, 24,000. And when you think about how much you actually need in the bank or in investments to retire, that’s a lot of years. There’s a reason you might have to work 40 or 50 years to get there. And so I quickly saw that although Sherry and I were making money, and we could afford a home in California, I saw that we were not going to get rich by saving. And that is something I think in the early days, again, 20, 25 years ago, I thought we could penny pinch or save our way into wealth. And some people might do that, but I didn’t see it as a path for us. And that was one of the motivations for starting companies. One, I wanted freedom, but also, I wanted an opportunity to be more in control of my income. And the idea that I needed more money to make money was frustrating to me because no matter how much I saved, it just didn’t grow fast enough. And by the time we were starting to make money, like real money from HitTail or Drip, we had saved up, I think it was around $350,000 in investments. And we were what? In our early to mid-30s. And so that’s not terrible, but that’s a lot of years and a lot of working to not have enough money to be able to retire on. These days, we are almost more in the barbell strategy. You can Google that if you haven’t heard of it. But we have, I’ll say, a traditionally small amount of money in typical investments like stock bonds and REITs, and we have more money in highly risky assets like a crypto, collectibles, startups and other alternative assets. And then we have a bigger chunk in extremely safe assets like cash or these days in the high interest rate environment in savings accounts or an equivalent that paying four or 5% on cash makes sense to do that. So I’m still a proponent of stocks, bonds, REITs and et cetera. We still have money in there, but it’s definitely become more of a background thing I’ll say, or just something. It’s an infrastructure thing of we put this money in and it’s great to watch it grow in your index funds, but it is not a major driver of wealth. It’s more of a way to maintain wealth or to grow wealth, but not to actually make wealth. And the seventh and for the most part, final thing that gave us any type of noticeable amount of money, obviously there are things like savings account interest over the years. Have we made single digit thousands? I’m not going to include stuff like that, but this is the last one that I think has made us tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands in lifetime wealth. And this was investing in real estate and it was in the early ‘2000s. We since have not bought a bunch of real estate. As I said, I have money in other things, and I know there are folks out there screaming at the microphone talking about the amazing tax write-offs. And I know there are tons of advantages to it, but it’s not something that we are presently in. The thing I was looking for was an edge. And so in the early ‘2000s in Los Angeles, we were buying up units and houses with two on a lots. And so we at one point had like seven units. And you could do this through leverage, right? I think it was three or four properties and seven total units. Many of them unpermitted as they are in LA. And you could do this through leverage because you could buy a half a million dollar or a $300,000 property with 5% down or something. And that cut both ways because when the market plummeted, of course, then you are losing a ton of money. But what I realized was that we had no edge, in that we had money and other people had more money and other people had inside deals and other people knew more about real estate than we did. And as such, I felt like I was the retail investor who was getting taken advantage of. And even though we owned these homes and there was some equity in them, we were really at the whim of the real estate market in LA. And as it started to crash in, it got soft in ’06, it started going down in ’07 or flatlining, and then in ’08 it started plummeting. We sold all of that because I didn’t want to be in debt, hundreds of thousands of dollars to the banks or have my properties foreclosed on. And it was something that that was the moment. If you think about that timing, that ’06, ’07, ’08, that was the moment that I had the realization of what is my edge? Well, my edge is I’m a software developer, I know how to write code. Is there a way that I can monetize that? Because not everyone can do that. And that’s when I realized, oh, if I learn to market and I know how to code, almost no one does that. And so that turns you into a pretty incredible force because if you can write copy and you can position products and you can do SEO, you can run ads, you can build something that people want and are willing to pay for, there are very few people that can do that. And that is where I realized I had the edge. And so at that point, we did sell the real estate that we had, and it sounds like we were real estate moguls or something. It’s like we were leveraged to the gills. And if in total we made 100,000, $200,000 over, it was many years of nights and weekends, as I was also doing software products. I was that guy that was trying to figure out the hustle. How do I raise our lot in life? How do we get out of working dollars for hours and making $30,000 a year, $50,000 a year, and actually get to a point where we have enough money that we can “make a difference,” right? That we have enough money that we can now make money by investing in typical investments or by dollar cost averaging into crypto. And that of course, led me to entrepreneurship, to software entrepreneurship and also writing books and all that. I just can’t underscore how much that changed mine and Sherry’s life. So to recap, seven ways that Sherry and I made life-changing wealth in our life, number one is selling companies. Number two is investing in crypto. It sounds so weird to say. Number three, running profitable companies. Four, angel investing. Five, salaried employment. Six, investing in typical investments like stocks, bonds, and REITs. And seven, investing in real estate specifically in the early ‘2000s. Hope you enjoyed this. It’s a bit of a story walk down memory lane, but also trying to pull out some learnings that I hope can help you as you move forward. And thanks to Christopher Gimmer for posting that tweet and reminding me of this thought process that I had a year or two ago so that I could revisit it here on this show.

I am your host, Rob Walling, in this episode of Hot Take Tuesday. Einar Vollset and Tracy Osborn join me to talk about once.com, to talk about how a company sold for half a billion dollars and the founders got nothing, at least according to this article. A developer who went from open source to a full-time income. Then we give some book recommendations and have a lightning round of reactions to controversial startup opinions. Before we dive into that, I want to let you know it’s your last chance to get tickets to MicroConf Atlanta. The event is April 21st through the 23rd. Speakers include Rand Fishkin from SparkToro, Asia Orangio from DemandMaven, Stephen Steers, myself, and Dr. Sherry Walling.It’s going to be hosted and emceed by me and Lianna Patch of Punchline Copy. I’m also going to be doing a fireside chat with Ben Chestnut, the co-founder of Mailchimp. He does not do very many public appearances, and so I’m very excited to host him at MicroConf this year. Microconf.com/us, if you’re interested in grabbing tickets. Again, tickets are going to sell out soon, so if you’re thinking about joining me and about 225 of your closest bootstrap founder friends, head to microconf.com/us. And with that, let’s dive into Hot Take Tuesday. Tracy Makes back for another Hot Take Tuesday.Tracy Osborn:I’m ready to fight with Einar.Rob Walling:Yes, it’s going to be great. Einar Vollset, thanks so much for joining us.Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.Rob Walling:We have some nice, fun, not at all spicy topics to jump into today. Kick us off. Once.com from 37signals. They’re basically saying, “It’s not software as a service, it’s just a software.” No subscription. You download the code, you set up your VM, your virtual machine or whatever it is. I’m sure they have, what is it, Docker containers and such. But is one-time software the best thing since Clippy, best thing since [inaudible 00:02:14] shooting first? Tracy, I want your opinion on this.Tracy Osborn:I think it’s good to have options, but I think there’s a reason why the world moved towards SaaS. And you’re looking at once.com and their first product, Campfire. For anyone who has a technical team who wants to dive in and do everything themselves, then this is a interesting idea to replace Slack. And for folks who just don’t want to go in that direction, again, having the technical teams to do this because Campfire says, “Free updates to any 1.x version.” So that means that updates are going to end at some point. And it says, “Bare bones support included.” So there might be support, but most stuff you’re going to have to figure on your own.This is why, for most folks, a SaaS product makes more sense for them even if it does have that subscription model and that idea they’re going to be paying for it forever and dealing with price increases and all that. I have other things to say about the product itself, Campfire, but I’m glad to see there’s other options. I can see that this being intriguing to a lot of folks, but not the majority of folks, and that’s why people are paying out the butt for things like Slack.Rob Walling:Einar Vollset, are we pivoting TinySeed to invest in one time sale software?Tracy Osborn:Why are you asking him?Einar Vollset:No. No, we’re definitely not.Tracy Osborn:I have opinions about that too.Rob Walling:We’ll come back to it.Einar Vollset:I think part of this grows out with how after the Slack acquisition, we’re now basically on the Salesforce pricing type in the Salesforce pricing world. So that means just going to get more expensive more quickly as we’re finding out with MicroConf and TinySeed. People get shocked when I tell them what our Slack bill is just for TinySeed and clearly there’s space there for… I actually think Slack itself has sort of failed at, or maybe by choice, but certainly they don’t cater well to this type of community. Not really like a business and not completely volunteer, but this halfway house where you want some of the features, but it really doesn’t make any ton of sense to be spending 50 or a hundred grand just for Slack software. And something like ONCE comes along. And if it’s good enough and you pay $299 once or whatever the price is, then certainly that’s very attractive from a consumer standpoint.I sort of echo most of the stuff that Tracy says. I think maybe the Basecamp guys are in a unique position, whether they realize quite how unique their sort of position with the fame and their whole… It feels to me their whole marketing approach has been contrarian takes as marketing. That’s sort of been Basecamp stick, so it doesn’t surprise me that a pricing effort like this comes from Basecamp. As much as I love them, I know that they probably get a lot of attention every time they say something unusual or different, so that fits in with that pattern more than anything else, I think. I don’t think it’s a winning formula for your average startup indie hacker, bootstrapper, TinySeed founder to be like, “Oh, screw it. Let’s not charge $250 a month or whatever. Let’s just do $300 once.” We’re already struggling hard enough to get founders to charge enough money of the value, like charge enough so that they capture some of the value that they create. If this becomes a, this is our standard, then that becomes even harder, I think.Rob Walling:Yeah. For me as both a founder and as a customer or consumer of software, I don’t want ONCE. And I get it, my opinion, I’m doing mere research instead of market research, but I used to own downloadable software that ran on a server, it was called .NET Invoice. And I will never go back because the headache of support was brutal. People would install it. And people would install it on their own server or on a GoDaddy shared hosting account and it wouldn’t work and it was their problem. They didn’t care it was their problem. They would flame me, they would charge back, they would ask for a refund, they would do whatever. Even though I was like, “Look, it’s your thing.” So then I’d spend an hour or two troubleshooting finally be like, “Oh, your server’s misconfigured here,” and they’re like, “Oh, sorry,” and then they’d fix it. And so two hours of my time for a $300 one time, although it was-Einar Vollset:Rob the IT consultants. That’s great. I’m sorry. You missed those days, don’t you?Rob Walling:Not at all. And it wasn’t recurring, right? It was 300 one time and then I got 20% annual maintenance, right, so $60 a year per. And I don’t want to do that ever again. I know this long slow SaaS ramp of death is a thing, but also it’s recurring and it’s my servers. And if there’s a problem, I’m responsible for it, but it’s my servers and I know that they’re configured. I know that ONCE says, “Minimal support,” but it’s like, yeah, but come on, people are still going to flame you. They’re still going to charge you back. They don’t give a [inaudible 00:07:10] when you say minimal because they’ll be convinced that it’s your bug. It’s your bug, and then guess what? It’s not, but they don’t care, right?Einar Vollset:Right.Rob Walling:Because people are idiots on the internet. And so I don’t want it as a entrepreneur, I also don’t want it as a consumer. I would prefer to just please just handle this. I don’t want to spend above, like I have enough trouble. We have a couple apps written in Python and I’m always like, “Where are those hosted, dude? Does anyone have access to those? What if they go down?” It’s like, enough that we’re be… Tracy [inaudible 00:07:38]. So, I don’t know. For me it’s like, as you said, I think it’s a contrarian thing. I think it’s an interesting experiment. I do not at all see that it’s where the market’s going.Einar Vollset:Basically, the way that I think about it, you’re basically building in a 100% monthly churn. I spent so much time thinking about how to reduce churn. The fact that you would design your software business model in a way that, “Hey, let’s have a 100% churn every month.”Rob Walling:And with .NET Invoice, the first of every month I had zero in revenue and I was like, “I got to start from nothing.” The only thing that worked was if I had ads running or SEO or some recurring traffic source, that was the only way to maintain. For me it was single digit thousands in revenue. Tracy, back to you.Tracy Osborn:It doesn’t make sense as a business model in our opinions, I guess for 37signals. It doesn’t make sense for large teams that are using Slack or Teams to switch to something like this because of the lack of supports. And I have some issues with the user experience. I’ve tried it out, I didn’t like it. So this product really only works for maybe small, very savvy tech teams that want to have control of their software and how many of those are out there and what’s going to stop those people from doing something else like Slack free or Discord or anything else? It just doesn’t seem like this is a problem where we’re like, “Okay, Slack is super expensive. It’s awful. People don’t like it, they want a solution for this,” but I don’t see this one being the thing that fixes that problem.Rob Walling:I heard Ian Landsman on a podcast, I forget what it was, but he was talking about the launch of this Campfire launch with ONCE. And I can’t find the source of this, but he said that they had sold 800 copies in the first week. 800 times $300 is a quarter million dollars. With 37signals reach, 800 copies just isn’t that much, and it’s not… Look, I know how one time sales go. The first week is the big week and then it goes down from there. It usually doesn’t go up, especially if it’s audience based. So it feels to me, I mean, $250,000 in revenue for them is a rounding error and it doesn’t feel like a success. That doesn’t feel like a success. It’s like, I don’t know. I would think they would need to move a lot more copies for them to be over the moon.Einar Vollset:You should get the Basecamp guys on here to ask them how it went.Rob Walling:Yeah.Einar Vollset:That should be, come on. Yeah, just invite them on and talk about it. Why not?Rob Walling:Yep, they’re TinySeed mentors and investors, so.Tracy Osborn:Yes, and we love them. We love them for that. I want a product like this to work, but it’s like when you really dig into the focus that would use it, the product itself, the way it’s sold, there’s a lot of issues they’re going to run into and they probably have our already run into at this point. Because I actually haven’t heard many people talk about it since it launched either.Rob Walling:No. For a second topic of the day, I go to fundablestartups.com. The headline is, Sell for Half a Billion \u0026 Get Nothing, and the summary is that FanDuel was acquired for 465 million in cash, but due to liquidation preferences, the FanDuel founders and most employees received nothing in the massive deal. And I’m going to kick it to you first on this one. Can you let our listeners know what liquidation preferences are and what happened in this deal?Einar Vollset:Yeah, I don’t know specifically what happened in this deal, but as a general concept, liquidation preferences are basically this notion that if an investor invests in your company, say they put a $100,000 in and they have a 1x liquidation preference, what that means is basically that when you sell, they get at least a $100,000 back if there is at least a $100,000 back if it’s a 1x liquidation preference. If there’s a 2x liquidation preference, then they get at least double their money back. And if it’s 3x liquidation preference, then they get three times their money back. And there are some nuances beyond that too in terms of like, is the liquidation preference participating or non-participating? So a non-participating 1x liquidation preference means the investor basically has to choose, do they want 1x their money back or do they want to participate in relation to how much they owe of the company?So obviously, if the transaction is at less than the valuation, they’ll exercise their liquidation preference and get their money back. If it’s larger than that, then they will choose to participate alongside the investors and not get a liquidation preference back. If it’s participating, then they get both. So that means if it’s a 3x participating, liquidation preference means you get three times your money back as the investor and then you participate based on your pro-rata share of the equity. If you don’t know what you’re talking about, if you don’t know what you’re doing, then it can be to the point where sort of unintentionally you didn’t even realize that actually the investors are getting their share plus 3x and you didn’t know that, and that might materially impact the actual money that you put in your pocket at the end of the day.With this one, I saw this come around for some reason it was back on Twitter the last couple of weeks and I was always like… The headline was this, “Here’s how you sell your business for a billion dollars and make zero.” And I was like, “There’s just no way on God’s green earth that’s actually accurate.” So usually what happens in these kinds of situations is you’re selling for less than the liquidation preference or your latest investors. But a lot of the time, most of the time, and also in this case you want the existing management team and team to stay on because if truly all the money does go directly to the investors, then what’s the point of keeping working there? You might as well just quit and then the company gets run into the ground.So usually, there’s this notion of a founder or management carve out as part of the transaction. So if they’re selling for 500 million, they might carve out 50 million of that and say, “Okay, 450 goes to the investors and they’ll do whatever they need to do in terms of their liquidation preference or whatever, and then 50 gets carved out as retention bonuses or whatever for the executive team.” Now what seems to have happened here is that the people who truly got zero are the original founders, but those original founders were no longer with the company. And that I can believe, if you are a founder and you basically signed a deal like this and you brought in whatever money, I think it was 275,000 in their latest Series E round and then you walk away, then yeah, I can definitely see how with the 2x liquidation preference, which is high but not [inaudible 00:14:10] or anything like that. I can definitely see how you end up with nothing.But I think what’s also been lost in that situation is there’s also no way that those founders didn’t get a bunch of money at that Series E. So the founders who walked away, I just do not believe that you get in a situation where you’re raising a 275 million Series E from private equity and family office money and you give up control. And so basically, you agree to 2x liquidation preference and drag along rights and then you take no money off the table as part of that transaction, that I don’t believe. I’m sure that the founders who are now suing already got paid a reasonable amount of money in 2015. I’d be shocked if not, and if not, then they are stupid and their advisors are even worse.Rob Walling:And so people listening might say, “Well, there should be no liquidation preferences. Those are predatory,” but they’re not, right? So when TinySeed invests, if we write you a check for $120,000, we have a 1x liquidation preference. And what that means is if tomorrow you were to sell your company for $200,000, we get our 120 back and then you get the rest. And it’s to protect us, because let’s say we invest that 120 for 12%, if we didn’t have a liquidation preference, you could sell it tomorrow for $200,000 and we’d only get 12%, we get 24,000 back, so you could just screw us. So that’s the case at least I know why they exist.Einar Vollset:Yeah, there’s a balance there, right? You have to have some level of investor protection, and different investors just have different rights and different approaches to things. We have zero liquidation preference in part because we invest in so many founders. So we have the full spectrum of personalities among our founders, and it just doesn’t make any sense for a professional investor not to have at least a 1x nonparticipating liquidation preference, which is what we have. But there are other investors who basically have 3x liquidation preferences. Yeah.Rob Walling:Tracy Makes, what are your thoughts on this?Tracy Osborn:I wish I had Einar on my team when I was back the day at my startup and I was joining a accelerator and trying to decide whether I was going to take outside money. I talked about this in MicroConf 2016 is how I met Rob because I started this startup and I bounced back and forth on raising, thinking I was like, “Oh, I’m going to raise money.” And then I was like, “No, I’m going to go back to bootstrapping.” And what actually happened is I raised money from this accelerator. A friend told me that this accelerator had, I want to say at least a 2x liquidation preference might’ve been three, and they were like, “FYI, this could cause trouble in the future.”I was dumb back then. I was like, “Okay, I’ll sign this anyways,” deciding not to raise money and going to bootstrapping. When I wanted to shut down the business and ideally I would like to sell the business so that I can move on and do other things like join TinySeed. Because of those terms and liquidation preference, and because I hadn’t raised money and because the company was, I couldn’t just as a bootstrap business be like, “All right, cool, I’m sticking myself a $20,000 sale and have some money from that,” but no I had this liquidation preference, I had this investor on board, all these old terms. I would have to pay back two or three times what they invested in me before I would see anything.So I just had to shut down the business at that point. I got so many emails from people being like, “Why can’t you just sell the business for peanuts and get a little bit of money?” And I was like, “Because I won’t because of this prior investor and the liquidation preference and all that stuff.” So it’s anecdotally, but it’s now I know more about terms and what to look out for when raising money. And hindsight being 2020, I wish that I heard for the great [inaudible 00:17:46], I could have negotiated that in some way, shape, or form, I didn’t do that. I just didn’t know back then. And now I understand how I got into that situation.Einar Vollset:Like a lot of founders they just look at the top line number, how much money am I getting in?Tracy Osborn:Yeah. Money.Einar Vollset:What’s the valuation and the story? And then they’re just like, “Whatever. Everything else will work out. We’ll just make a ton of money and then it doesn’t matter,” but it does matter. And really investor behavior and their terms particularly early on really matters. It can materially impact your ability to fundraise. It can materially impact your ability to sell the company. There’s lots of things with just making sure that the terms that you’re getting are reasonably balanced. It doesn’t have to be super founder-friendly because that 0x liquidation preference doesn’t make any sense either. But finding the right balance there I think is key.Rob Walling:And I could see an indie hacker posting this on Twitter and saying, “See? Funding, never raise funding. It’s the devil.” And it’s that’s not the lesson either, right? Funding is a tool. You don’t say that a hammer or a shovel is a tool, but understand when they work and when they don’t and understand what you’re getting into, understand which strings might be attached, educate yourself, hire a good lawyer and don’t just sign paper because funding can get you there faster. And we see this with TinySeed companies every day, so it’s not that it’s good or bad or indifferent, it is just a thing. And yes, there are predatory investors out there. There are really [inaudible 00:19:12] founders who try to screw their investors too. It cuts both ways. And so, that’s where liquidation preferences are a thing that’s part of the ecosystem.Tracy Osborn:I think it’s not just understanding the term, but also understanding different scenarios about what those mean. Because there are scenarios where a certain term could make sense and there’s scenarios where certain terms that don’t make sense and just being aware of where those are or will make the future less. Make it easier to plan for the future because you know what direction to go to based on the terms that you have. There is a book… Einar, don’t talk about books later, but I want to talk about, what was it, the book Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist by Brad Feld, that was something I read post my investment in my prior startup that I wish I had read before I took that investment. Because people told me it was predatory. I thought I understood it, but that broke things down in a way where then I really understood what those scenarios meant for me.Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

And for me, I mean, it’s an interesting story. Most people who started an open source project are not able to build a business around it. I believe it might even be supporting him full time, but the interesting part for me was he had the open source project and then it was under the AGPL license, which is extremely permissive. And then if you wanted an MIT license, then you had to pay him and it was €250 per year and basically he was making nothing. Like a year and a half, he made €750 in total revenue.The big shift was basically saying, you need a valid license within 15 minutes after the app where it stops working. So he actually implemented what we would think of as a time-limited SaaS trial, and that instantly changed the whole game. He changed it from almost a donation model, right? It’s like, “Hey, can I have tips? To like, you need to pay to use the software?” Oh yeah, I guess he says at the end, the current MRR is €6,100 and growing steadily, which in Estonia where he lives allows him to pay himself a decent salary. So it is a full-time income. So Tracy, what’s your take on this story?Tracy Osborn:This is a fun topic because I have a lot of friends that are in the open source industry and I actually read this article and decided to ask a few friends, and I honestly don’t think that the licenses were the biggest factor here. It’s actually the founder or the creator of this service moving from a, “If I build it, they will come type,” of product to doing essentially sales. Because they talk about raising, they setting the price and they set a way for that they can get that money in and then they increase the pricing. And it’s all those kinds of things that we’ve talked about with founders just in general about, you can’t just build something and hope that people are going to send you money at some point. You have to be thoughtful about your pricing and how people are going to be using your product and do that sales stuff. That was the biggest difference. It wasn’t the changing of the licenses, it was the changing of how this person was selling and looking at the product through their own eyes.Rob Walling:Einar Vollset, what are your thoughts?Einar Vollset:My thought this is still probably vastly underpriced and he should probably 10X’s prices overnight. That’s what I think.Rob Walling:That’s what it feels like to me too.Einar Vollset:I mean, stuff [inaudible 00:23:35] around here. He already says it in the thing, 250 a year became 495, became 695, became 795, and finally 895. I’m like, “Brother, how about trying adding in a zero and see how that goes?”Rob Walling:There we go.Einar Vollset:Why not?Tracy Osborn:It’s [inaudible 00:23:47].Einar Vollset:What’s the worst that could happen?Rob Walling:Inspiring words from a man who knows SaaS pricing. Yep, that’s part of the TinySeed playbook, the not-so-secret part of raising prices. As we move towards wrapping up, I would like to get a book recommendation from each of you, and then we’re going to do a lightning round called Agree or Disagree, and it’s based on the Twitter thread that I started, which is what’s your most controversial opinion about building startups? I got 150 responses to that. I’m probably actually going to cover some of them in depth on a future podcast episode, but we’ll bounce through some of the spicy takes, controversial things, and I want to hear from each of you. Before we do that, Tracy Osborn, do you have a nonfiction book recommendation for folks?Tracy Osborn:All right, so in addition to Venture Deals, so if you ever want to raise money or you want to learn about these terms and things that go into taking a venture capital, definitely get Venture Deals by Brad Feld. But the other one I wanted to mention is a negotiation book by Chris Voss, Never Split the Difference. I have so much trouble with negotiation. I don’t like being in a position where I’m arguing against someone for my own benefit because my brain melts into a puddle and I get anxious and all that stuff. And I think this book really helps redefine how negotiation works in a way that really works for my brain, where a lot of it is taking that negotiation, having empathy for the person across the table, but then using that empathy to get what you want and that resonates with me.So it’s not a fight back and forth when you’re negotiating. It’s seeing from their perspective, bringing up that perspective to that person as you’re going through the negotiation, finding that middle ground. It’s called Not Never Split the Difference, which I think is anti-middle ground, but it was a book that was really useful for me to understand a better way of negotiation.Rob Walling:And you also had a fiction book that you accidentally pasted in because you misread it. We might as well just throw that out as a bonus.Tracy Osborn:I read more fiction books than I do nonfiction because that was my way of turning off my brain from work, and I probably read about a book a week. Best book I’ve read fiction-wise recently is the Anomaly by French author Hervé Le Tellier. I hopefully I’m saying this correctly. If anyone wants a cool fiction book with beautiful writing, I would recommend just trusting my recommendation and don’t read the description of the book because it has a spoiler, and I think that the journey on that book is worth it to start completely scratch. Make sure you go through the first five chapters. It’s going to seem weird in the beginning, but I think it’s worth it. And I think it’s a good way to turn your brain off of business and read something fun and be transported to another world.Rob Walling:Einar Vollset, what’s your book recommendation?Einar Vollset:Oh, given that Tracy somehow managed to put three in there, I’m going to push with a combination of things. So, I really liked The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin, which is he was this chess wonder kid who also ended up becoming the world number two or world champion in some sort of an Asian fight sport thing that I don’t exactly recall now. He’s a very interesting guy. He’s this consultant to a high performers now and he talks about his approach to learning and how he coaches people on that. So I really like that one. And it is also just a good story. It’s pretty biographical about his growing up and him going through both the chess and the martial arts world.That one’s good. And then I like a more philosophical book, which is David Deutsch’s, The Beginning of Infinity, which doesn’t really have any takeaways shape or form, particularly as it relates to B2B SaaS. It’s just an interesting way to think about the world that I think counters a lot of the… I think there’s an inherent negativity bias in the world in general. People are pretty convinced that finally, now here we are, it’s going to end very soon because we’re all [inaudible 00:27:30], versus this is the opposite and antidote to that, so I like that a fair bit.Rob Walling:Well, since you each gave a few recommendations, I won’t give one this week. People have heard enough from me. I had one, but I’ll table it for now. Now, I want a lightning round this, agree or disagree with these controversial opinions about building startups. We’ll start with Tracy. It’s from Dominic Mon, “Most developers get a better deal sitting it out in big tech.” Meaning instead of becoming a founder, sitting it out and working for FAANG or something, what do you think?Tracy Osborn:I mean, is money the only thing that matters or is working on something that’s interesting and challenging and having time freedom and all those other things? It’s like big tech works if you want to just make a whole bunch of money and then potentially be in a situation where you’re working on 09:00 to 05:00 and that’s it. But startups and they’re riskier, but it might be more challenging and more fun in different ways.Rob Walling:Einar, what do you think, “Most devs get a better deal sitting it out in big tech.”Einar Vollset:Yeah, financially speaking, most likely, yes. I think the expected financial outcome for the median one probably is probably higher, particularly if you get a job at the FAANG in Silicon Valley. Those US type salaries. Yeah, I think so. What you don’t get necessarily is the freedom to do your own thing and potential for a significantly higher outcome than you most likely to get in FAANG.Rob Walling:Next tweet is from our very own Interval Set, “Product led growth is where founders too scared to do sales, go to hide.” Tracy, what’s your lightning round take on this?Tracy Osborn:I mean, I’m drinking the TinySeed Kool-Aid at this point, so that comes straight from Ainar. I can’t disagree with him.Rob Walling:Yep. Ainar, you care to elaborate on this?Einar Vollset:I just agree with myself. I think it’s a very wise thing to say. I think in general, this Twitter account really truly is just quality after quality tweet nonstop.Rob Walling:Where’s the thumbs down? It is next to the heart, there should be a thumbs down. I want to dislike this tweet just because you said that.Einar Vollset:There’s a mute button, surely.Tracy Osborn:This relates to the open source stuff where there’s folks who want to build something and are like, “If I build it, people will come. Ooh, product-led growth. My product is going to be so amazing that people are going to be throwing themselves at me to pay me money.” As we’ve seen with many, many companies in TinySeed that marketing and sales is incredibly important.Einar Vollset:Yeah. I mean, to elaborate just a little bit more fundamentally what I’m trying to say here is I don’t think people realize that how consultancy sales really is, how you can’t just throw things up there and be like, “Hey, go use it whenever.” Probably the highest value SaaS businesses actually requires the sales, which almost looks like consulting. That’s what I think a lot of the time.Rob Walling:Our next take is from [inaudible 00:30:21] and Speaker James Kennedy. His take is, “It is not actually that hard.” Implying that building a startup is not actually that hard. Tracy, what’s your take?Tracy Osborn:It’s just the bold. I guess when you look at-Rob Walling:Bolds statement.Tracy Osborn:The bold statement, when you look at something again in hindsight, I’ll go back to looking at my startup and I look back at what I did with Wedding Lovely compressing those nine years altogether, I would agree that it wasn’t that hard, but the day-to-day stuff can feel like the worst thing in the world. You can go through those dips that it does feel like it’s harder than anything else that you’ve done because you’re having a bad day, things aren’t going well. So I think it’s long-term perspective, it can feel not as hard, but in the short term it’s really hard to tell people that.Rob Walling:Einar, what’s your take?Einar Vollset:I disagree with James here. I think it’s extremely hard. I think mentally more than anything else. I see that with founders and we support this question and TinySeed, it’s a mental rollercoaster in a way that just going to work and just the stress of it too, particularly once you start having employees that you feel like you’ve got to look after and all that stuff. Yeah, I think it’s hard.Tracy Osborn:It evolves. It’s hard to say that hard because you’re looking at everything, but getting from zero to one is a challenge and then scaling that is a challenge. Then working with employees is a challenge. Then jumping into enterprise sales can be the next challenge. Then having your mindset, right, so you can sell your company is also a challenge. All those things do add up.Einar Vollset:I think in general, people underestimate. I think a lot of the time people think like, “Oh, as soon as I get to a million in ARR,” or whatever number or there’s some hurdle, then it’ll just be coasting and just executing more versus that’s not the case. There’s always fresh things. Start again, add new things all the time in order to keep growth up.Rob Walling:So do two of you know the definition of a lightning round? You’re not supposed to go back and forth. You’re supposed to just-Einar Vollset:Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, whatever.Rob Walling:… weigh in with a quick thought.Tracy Osborn:We like talk big.Rob Walling:I’m never doing-Einar Vollset:Whatever.Rob Walling:… a lightning round again with you two. I’m going to replace the-Tracy Osborn:I mean, to be fair, this is lightning round compared to our normal discussions.Rob Walling:Really, really? Yes.Einar Vollset:Yeah, I’m glad you just… Come on. This is superfast.Tracy Osborn:We like talking.Rob Walling:Our final lightning round is a tweet from Caesar Halmasian. “Startups are a trap. Businesses are way better.” Tracy, are startups a trap and lifestyle businesses way better?Tracy Osborn:I don’t like going first. If I’m going to be truly lightning round, I want to hear Einar go first.Rob Walling:Einar.Einar Vollset:No. You say, [inaudible 00:32:55]. No.Rob Walling:Care to elaborate or shall we just move on to…Einar Vollset:No. I mean, I think are startups are trapped? No. Lifestyle is way better. It depends what you’re optimizing for. If what you want to do is just futz around and start seven different an info product and some e-commerce drop shipping thing and a couple of SaaS’s and buy something and a newsletter that you monetize and just to start, if that’s what you’re happy doing, that’s great. But if what you’re wanting to do is something bigger, make most likely more money, then startups can definitely be the way. But there are different ways to do that too, right? There’s a difference between bootstrapping a SaaS business that you’re hoping to sell for 20 million bucks compared to starting Open AI where apparently you’re going to raise $7 trillion and build Silicon in the desert, right? They’re just different things. I don’t think anything is better. I think it’s a good thing that Elon Musk decides that he’s going to build Tesla and go to Mars or whatever. That’s fine. It just is what it is. For him, there’s no better or worse, I don’t think.Rob Walling:Yeah, I’ve done both, right? I’ve had great lifestyle businesses. I’ve had what I would consider startups. I mean, I would do consider TinySeeds a startup, MicroConf a startup, Drip certainly was, and I fall into the startup camp. Lifestyle business is great and it got a little boring and just working 10 hours a week for making my money was, I wanted something where I could be more ambitious about it and where I could really have a purpose around it. And that I think is what the startups that I’ve chosen to build have brought in addition to monetary rewards that were far beyond the lifestyle businesses. Lifestyle businesses in the short term, of course, you’re making income net profit on it. It’s taxed at income tax rates, and if you exit a startup, right, usually depending on where you live, you get that long-term cap gains and you accelerate, you get 10 years of net profit, 20 years of net profit if I’m talking SaaS. But it depends on multiples and such, but you can really accelerate that earning. Tracy closing thoughts on this tweet?Tracy Osborn:Ditto.Rob Walling:Nailed it.Tracy Osborn:Nice. I just wanted to go there. Boom.Rob Walling:Einar Vollset, folks want to keep up with you. Einar Vollset on Twitter, you work on TinySeed. You also are the principal of Discretion Capital. So someone’s listening to this and they have a SaaS company doing at least 2 million ARR and they’re thinking about selling. You’re a sell-side M\u0026A advisory, and they should reach out to you. Einar@discretioncapital.com.Einar Vollset:[inaudible 00:35:23].Rob Walling:Tracey Makes, you are Tracey Makes on Twitter. So your name is Tracey Osborn. So everyone knows, but I call it your nickname as Tracey Makes, so that is-Tracy Osborn:Because I couldn’t get Tracey Osborn on Twitter, so I’m now Tracey Makes, yes.Rob Walling:Yes. Tracey Makes on Twitter, tinyseed.com. Anywhere else you want to send folks?Tracy Osborn:I’m probably more active on the TinySeed social media accounts than I am on my personal one. So if you’re ever talking with TinySeed [inaudible 00:35:46] on Twitter, that is me. I hesitate to mention this because then people are going to look at it, but I am also trying to get a TikTok account off the ground and I couldn’t get Tracy Makes for that one, so I’m [inaudible 00:35:58].Rob Walling:What?Einar Vollset:Just in time for it to be banned.Tracy Osborn:I know, right? I need to get better at doing videos.Einar Vollset:If you get banned right after you launched this, then I’m going to blame you. I’m going to say Tracy, you brought down TikTok with you.Tracy Osborn:Yeah. Yeah, my little startup talking about negotiation and other little videos I’m doing took it all down. But itstracymakes on TikTok because that is another place I did not get my preferred username.Rob Walling:Oh, so it’s I-T-S-Tracy Osborn:Tracy Makes.Rob Walling:So, itstracymakes-Tracy Osborn:Yep, on TikTok.Rob Walling:… on TikTok.Tracy Osborn:Yep.Rob Walling:Amazing. And if you’re not following me @robwalling on Twitter and saasplaybook.com these days is probably my most recent effort that you should check out. Tracy, thanks for joining me for this Hot Take Tuesday.Tracy Osborn:Always fun.Rob Walling:Einar, thanks for coming around, man.Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.Rob Walling:Thanks again to Tracy and Einar for joining me on this week’s episode.

As always, I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in today’s very special episode, I’m going to be walking through some advice that I’ve been giving over the past 10 plus years on the show, in conference talks, even in some of my books that I’ve really started to rethink as new evidence has presented itself recently. The more conversations I get into on Hacker News and Twitter around these topics of being a founder and launching a startup, rules of thumb and things that I’ve made recommendations on where, look, I’m not the person who says always never. But I will admit with many of these, I’ve said 90%, 95%, 98% of the time, I believe that this advice is sound. And in today’s episode, I’m going to talk about how I’m rethinking that on a few key points. The first point that I’m rethinking and want to maybe offer different advice than I have in the past is around pricing. And you’ve heard me say that pricing is the biggest lever in SaaS, and I still believe that. And I know that if your annual contract value is $500 a year, you have maybe 5 or 6 B2B marketing approaches that you can do, and there’s a bunch you cannot because you just can’t afford to do them. And if you’re charging, I don’t know, it’s in the 5 to $7,500 a year, then you probably have 10 or 12 that you can do. And if you’re charging 30,000, 40,000 and up, then all 20 of the B2B SaaS marketing approaches that I talk about on the show and in my book, The SaaS Playbook, are available to you. And all that’s true and I stand by that. But what I’ve realized is I think myself and the rest of the MicroConf community have gotten a little too hung up on increasing prices and feeling like raising your prices, A, that it’s the solution to everything. But B, that it’s always good. And I’ve started to take the other side of that argument pretty seriously. Like, what would happen if you lowered prices? A lot of good can come out of that. Imagine that instead of having a product that you’re selling for 200, $300 a month, even $100 a month, you go down market and you charge $10 a month, $20 a month. So many benefits can come from doing that. Things like you’ll attract a lot more customers because how many people or businesses can afford to pay hundreds a month? Well, there’s obviously a lot more that can afford to pay 10 or $20 a month. And so this increases your potential market, your total addressable market, as the VCs would say. I always like to call it the term, the total reachable market because who cares if it’s a total market if you can’t reach them in the ways that you’re marketing. But as I’ve thought about it, I’ve realized there are so many benefits. It widens your market. I know that I’ve talked about lower prices increasing churn, and that is true, but realize that there’s a plus side to churn as well. It means that the people who don’t need your product will leave, and you don’t need to support them anymore, and you don’t need to provide them with whatever hard disk space respond to their emails. There are a lot of benefits for people churning out. And so what I’m saying is that 2024 for me is going to be the year of going down market, and that’s going to be my default advice for founders coming to me with issues in their startup. “Are you plateaued? Have you thought about lowering prices? Are you not finding enough customers? Have you thought about lowering prices? None of your marketing is working. Nobody wants to use your product. Have you thought about lowering prices?” 2024, the year of going down market. Speaking of down market and lowering prices, there’s another paradigm or piece of advice that I’ve been giving, it’s got to be 14 years, probably more than this, 15 years. And it’s that if you’re going to build software, whether it’s SaaS, downloadable, whatever, that you target businesses, that B2B is superior to B2C. And I’ve really started rethinking that based on evidence again, that I’ve seen Twitter, Hacker News and folks who are charging these $5, $10 downloads for sometimes they’re one time and sometimes it’s monthly. But think about the benefits of targeting consumers. There are a lot, and there’s a lot that I ignore and don’t talk about on this show, and I feel kind of bad about it, which is why I’m recording this episode and putting it out like this because I wanted to get it to you as soon as possible. But think about if your entire addressable market of businesses in your space is 20,000, 50,000, 200,000 businesses, if you shifted your focus and went after consumers, billions. Billions of potential customers. So why would you focus on a small market with tens of thousands or at best hundreds of thousands of potential customers when you can have billions of customers? And not only that, but B2C apps, they are just a lot more interesting than B2B apps. B2B apps are kind of boring. Who wants to build CRM software for realtors or the business operating system for gyms and fitness studios when you can build software that’s used by people like you and I, and my brother, and my uncle, and my parents? It’s a way to not only sell to customers, but also to get recognition from people who will finally understand what you do. Your mom will no longer say, “My son or my daughter who’s a startup founder, they fix computers.” She might actually be a user of your app. And think about how much cooler that would feel than trying to explain email marketing to someone who has no idea what you’re talking about. And then they basically summarize it by saying, “Oh, so you provide software for people to spam you” which is a response that I got when building Drip a little too often, especially at family reunions. But not only that, there’s one other thing that B2C apps have that B2B apps very, very rarely have, and it’s virality. And I have not leaned in nearly enough to that incredibly powerful marketing approach of going viral that B2C apps allow you where consumers just talk and they spread the word for you and you just build the product and you don’t have to market it. And what’s a better dream than building an app with billions of potential customers who market it for you and maybe even your mom or dad will understand what you do? So on this show, I am going to start embracing B2C. And look, I’m not saying it’s better than B2B, but it’s at least on the same level, and I’m going to see how my opinion shake out over the coming year. The third thing that’s been bugging me, and I finally was able to put my finger on it last week, is I’ve talked a lot about two-sided marketplaces and how bootstrapping them is difficult and how you shouldn’t do it. And on this episode, I’m taking that back. What I’ve realized is that a SaaS app is a one-sided not marketplace, and a SaaS app has to do a lot. The software is the value. The job to be done is whatever the software is doing. With a two-sided marketplace, not only do you have two sides and much like going B2B to B2C, you now have so many more options for customers. Going from a one-sided not marketplace to a two-sided marketplace gives you so many more options. You now have two audiences that you can market to and sell to. You now have two audiences that you can provide different value propositions to, and you now have two audiences that you can build your product for. So I’ve realized the error of my ways in thinking that just because something is simpler, I.E. a B2B SaaS app doesn’t make it better. In addition, the job to be done of a two-sided marketplace, it’s done just by connecting people. All you have to do is take an Uber driver, pair them up with a rider, and it’s done. You don’t need to build a bunch of software that’s really hard to build. You could almost do this with no code or a Google sheet. Imagine eBay and Upwork and how simple those would be to launch today in terms of the software you’d have to build. The value is in connecting the two sides, and that makes these much easier and in fact, much simpler businesses. And I want to apologize for leading you astray on that point for the past many years. The fourth and final point I want to cover today is again, something that I want to backtrack on that I’ve talked about. I no longer believe in the value of focus, and I no longer believe that you need to launch a product, solve a problem, find product market fit, and invest time and energy into an idea and iterate on it and get it to the point where you’re providing value. Some people call it product market fit. I call it building something people want and are willing to pay for. Instead, I think that we should all be launching a bunch of things to see what sticks. We’re makers. We should make. We’re builders. We should build. Since it’s all just luck anyway, why wouldn’t I make a bunch of apps and throw them out there and see which ones get traction? If I’m in Las Vegas and I’m playing blackjack and I know that it’s all just luck, why wouldn’t I just play 10 hands figuring one of these will win eventually. The best part is I’m now giving you permission as the builder, the coder, the developer, the maker to just go build. All you have to do is build and launch. That’s it. I’m not going to talk to you about selling, about talking to humans, about listening to people’s pain points about marketing. I mean, who wants to learn SEO, who wants to deal with ads and creating content and cold outreach and trying to figure out what to do next amid the pain of launching a startup? No one does. So don’t do it. Look inside and ask yourself, “What do I want to do? What fits my personality?” And I bet if you’re really honest, what fits your personality is to make stuff and launch it and not do any of the hard things. So 2024, along with being the year of going down market, B2C, and bootstrapping two-sided marketplaces is going to be the year of launching a bunch of things to see what sticks. Obviously, the show is going to change quite a bit, and I bet you’re super curious to hear what tomorrow’s episode is like in light of my recent revelations. But I do want to point one thing out to you in case you haven’t checked your calendar. Today’s date is April 1st of 2024, and in many countries, today is a April Fool’s Day. So I apologize in arrears and I can be held responsible for nothing I’ve said in this episode. The views expressed in this episode of Startups For the Rest of Us are neither the views of MicroConf, TinySeed nor of Rob Walling. They’re the views of April Fool’s Day, 2024. I was really trying to steel man those arguments though, trying to look at the bright sides until it just got a little crazy. I was going to go on. I have three more things. Shouldn’t you build a second product if your first stops growing? What about multi-language support? How about take investment in the launch of the products? What about defining a new category when you’re bootstrapping? No, there’s a lot, I realize. I think I’m taking the joke too far. So I appreciate you listening today. This does not preempt the normal episode of Startups For the Rest of Us this week, so we will be back tomorrow with your normally scheduled episode that will be on topic, super serious as always, not an April Fool’s joke. Appreciate you hanging with me today. If you thought this was funny or if I actually got you for even a bit, please hit me up on Twitter. You can send an email to questions@startupsfortherestofus.com. I’m curious at what point most people realized that this was a joke episode because I started getting a little crazy with some of the B2C stuff. And if this is your first episode, if you’re listening to this months down the line, I’m probably putting an introduction, a warning, a disclaimer if you will, not to listen to it, just to skip to the next episode. But if this is your first episode, you may want to go back and listen to the 2, 3, 4 prior to this to see what this show is actually about. If you liked this one, thought it was funny, hit me up on Twitter, and if you didn’t, don’t bother. I’ll be back again in your earbuds tomorrow for another regularly scheduled episode.

We’ve sold more than 90% of the tickets, and we will sell this event out as we have for many years. The event is April 21st through the 23rd in Atlanta, Georgia at the amazing Starling Atlanta. It’s a vibrant, upscale escape for creative souls. It’s going to be a great event.There are going to be 200-ish of your closest Bootstrap and mostly Bootstrap founder friends who are showing up to hear talks from folks like Rand Fishkin of SparkToro, Asia Orangio of DemandMaven. I’m giving a talk that has never appeared on this YouTube channel, and a talk by Dr. Sherry Walling on staying motivated as an entrepreneur.We have a special guest MC, Leanna Patch, and a very special guest who has never appeared on the MicroConf stage before, Ben Chestnut, the co-founder of MailChimp. He really doesn’t do many in-person events, but he has agreed to come on and do a fireside chat with me, I’m really looking forward to it.If you haven’t attended a MicroConf in a few years, we’ve changed the format. We used to have 9 or 10 speakers over two days, so it was a lot of content, a lot of sitting in seats, and we’ve completely reorganized it. We have about five talks, and the afternoons are reserved for interaction for workshops and for our excursions. We’ve done excursions like ax throwing, brewery tours, improv classes. I know we aren’t hosting all of those here in Atlanta, but those are the types of things we do to get you out of the building, a little bit out of your comfort zone, but to be around other founders and make friends because MicroConf is about relationships. And that’s the thing we have doubled down on over the past three or four years as we’ve re-engineered the event from focusing on content to focusing on the community and the relationships that are built between founders.So if you’re thinking about attending, you want to head to microconf.com/us and buy your ticket. Unfortunately, I’m going to be unable to help you out when we sell out and you email me asking if you can get a ticket, because once we’re done, we’re done. It’s Microconf.com/us, and if you want to meet up again with about 200-ish of your closest founder friends that from past MicroConfs, from MicroConf Remote, from MicroConf Connect, and of course the Bootstrap community on Twitter started around MicroConf. So many of those folks that you know are going to be attending. So you don’t want to miss out. Microcomp.com/us.

Welcome back to another episode of Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m Rob Walling, and in this week’s episode, I do a Rob solo adventure, where I’m going to talk through a few topics, always bringing it back to being a bootstrapped or mostly bootstrapped startup founder. Before we dive into that, I want to let you know it’s your last chance to get tickets to MicroConf Atlanta. The event is April 21st through the 23rd. Speakers include Rand Fishkin from SparkToro, Asia Orangio from DemandMaven, Stephen Steers, myself, and Dr. Sherry Walling. It’s going to be hosted and emceed by me and Lianna Patch of Punchline Copy. I’m also going to be doing a fireside chat with Ben Chestnut, the co-founder of Mailchimp. He does not do very many public appearances, and so I’m very excited to host him at MicroConf this year. MicroConf.com/us, if you’re interested in grabbing tickets. Again, tickets are going to sell out soon, so if you’re thinking about joining me and about 225 of your closest bootstrap founder friends, head to MicroConf.com/us. My first topic of today is how the startup world and the bootstrapper, MicroConf community, and I’m kind of breaking those. Those are overlapping Venn diagrams, but they really are two different things. I think of the startup world as probably being more of the Silicon Valley high growth stuff, and then bootstrapping, and MicroConf being maybe a subset of that with some overlap. But the idea is that the startup world struggles to not only learn from prior art, but to credit prior art. It’s two related things, but they really are different. So if you’re an academic and you go, let’s say get your PhD in psychology, or in computer science, and you’re writing papers or writing a dissertation or a thesis, it is 100% plagiarism if you claim someone else’s idea as your own, without giving credit. It doesn’t mean you can’t talk about ideas that you’ve heard elsewhere, but you give them credit. So if you go on Twitter and you say, “I had this great idea, it’s to do things that don’t scale,” or even if you don’t say, “I had this great idea,” but you go on and say, “Here’s a secret to success, little known, do things that don’t scale in the early days so that those will eventually lead you to be able to scale up,” but you never mention that Paul Graham wrote an essay called Do Things that Don’t Scale, and he wrote it back in, I don’t know, 2006 or 2007. And it is a very commonly known idea and thought that he came up with, and you don’t credit that, you are plagiarizing someone else’s idea, because the people reading that think you came up with it by default. If you say something and don’t credit, they believe you came up with it. Not a week goes by … Literally, not a week. Sometimes it’s more than that, that I don’t see someone on Twitter, or YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News, claiming a concept, or even not claiming it, but not crediting a concept that’s pretty well-defined, that either I invented or Paul Graham came up with, or Jason Cohen, or Hiten Shah, that has pretty obvious and clear prior art, and it’s not like someone saying, “Oh, work hard for success.” Right? That’s a pretty generic way of talking about it, but if someone says, “You have to work hard, and you need skills,” and then there’s a little bit of luck involved. Well, obviously, that is exactly the framework that I talk about for achieving success, is hard work, luck, and skill, and so you can rephrase those two things or whatever, but if you pick those exact three things, the odds of that being a coincidence that we both came up with it, that you came up with it on your own without the influence is pretty unlikely. And this is really common, like in the creator maker influencer space, the info product, info marketing space. People are just kind of plagiarizing, and I find it frustrating, I think, as someone who does a lot of deep thinking about this stuff and comes up with a lot of frameworks, and seeing things, whether it’s mine or someone else’s, it just never feels right that folks on the internet, in the startup space, I don’t know why they feel like they need to do that. I don’t believe that it’s an accident. I think it’s pretty intentional, but the thing is, is it’s not just crediting prior art and just saying, “Oh, yeah, that person came up with this idea, but here, I’m going to build on top of it,” or, “Here is how I implemented it,” or, “Here is how it impacted me.” It’s not negative to you to just say that, to just give the credit, but the other thing is not just crediting prior art, it’s learning from prior art, and I see so many folks trying to reinvent the wheel and justify it by saying, “Well, I’m going back to first principles,” or, “That’s rule of thumb, common wisdom, therefore, I’m going to go against that.” Like the teenager in the family, every what, generation rebels against the prior generation, right? There’s an example of Ryan Breslow, Breslow. I don’t know how you pronounce his name, but he was the founder and CEO of Bolt, and he was the guy … I don’t know, he’s a 20-something who just thought he knew everything, basically, and he went on Twitter, and what, flame Stripe and Y Combinator as being some type of mafia, or a cabal or whatever. Anytime I hear this type of phrasing, I’m like, “Oh, boy, someone really wants some clicks rather than fighting the good fight.” But anyways, Bolt was giving loans to their employees so that employees could buy stock options, and then Bolt lost 97% of its value, and so anyone who took out loans to buy their stock options now owes the company money, sometimes thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. At the same time, this founder, Ryan Breslow, sold millions of dollars of his shares in secondary, so he seems to walk away okay, but it’s kind of a disaster for employees who are now on the hook for these funds. The thing is, this was already attempted. If you listen to the All-In Podcast, you’ll hear David Sacks talk about this, where this had already been attempted in the ’90s, and it was proven to be a disaster, but he was touting it as this great new invention, this employee-friendly thing. A, did no one tell him this is a catastrophic idea, they tried this 30 years ago, and this same thing happened, or B, did people tell him, and he waved that off, right? He said, “Well, no, I’m going back to first principles. They did it differently. They did it wrong in the past.” I’m not saying we should be tied to every mistake that everyone makes in the past and never try things that didn’t work, but you have to learn from that art and do it differently. You have to learn from the failures and not just try the same thing again and expect a different outcome. If we are not as a community learning from prior art and reading books like Paul Graham’s Hackers \u0026 Painters, or the old blog post from Joel Spolsky, old posts from Peldi Guilizzoni, Patrick McKenzie, my books, my old blog posts and podcast episodes, if you just come on the scene and you don’t read any of that, then you can’t stand on the shoulders of giants. There’s a reason that in academics, you study and you go to school to learn what people before you have learned, so that you don’t have to reinvent everything from scratch every two weeks. If you come on the scene and you don’t read any of that, then prior to yesterday’s Twitter feed or Hacker News, do we just start over from zero every week or two, and we don’t drag anything along with us? Now, you could say, “Well, dragging things along is baggage,” and I want to, once again, go back to first principles, but at least know, “What’s been tried?” At least know, “What’s been talked about?” And you can make a case to disagree with it, but even that, just knowing what the common wisdom is, and then zigging when everyone else is zagging, at least make that a deliberate decision, not just a decision of, “I’m going to do this because I didn’t educate myself that I need to actually market and sell this,” even though, every week on this podcast I’m saying that. You go and start a B2C business, it has high churn, and you’re surprised everyone is price sensitive, even though every other week, I talk about that. You go and start a B2C two-sided marketplace, try to bootstrap it with no audience, even though I’ve said it so much, it’s become part of the Startups For the Rest of Us drinking game. And look, I’m not saying just me. I’m not saying, “Oh, I should say things, and everyone on the internet should hear it.” It’s not the case. There are so many smart people with experience that are talking about these things, and yet, there are so many people who are making the same mistakes over and over because they’re not doing any of the learning or the research on their own in order to stand on the shoulders of giants. As you start your journey, it’s hard enough already. Learn from the mistakes of others. You do not have to make every mistake yourself, and hopefully, if you’re a creator, if you’re recording videos, if you’re putting out podcasts, if you’re tweeting, that next time you mention someone else’s idea or framework, that you give them credit. My next topic is a concept I mentioned on a podcast four or five years ago, and then poof, it just disappeared. I had forgotten it. I think it was during an interview, and the idea of it … I want to bring it back up today because I’ve realized that there’s a lot of value in this framework. It’s about early stage product validation, okay? So if you’re a later stage founder, you may want to skip this section, but the framework I’m calling the 2-20-200 validation framework. So you know how I have the 1-9-90 rule, right? That’s where I think about 1% of tech companies should consider raising venture, about 9% should consider raising some type of funding, whether it’s angel, TinySeed, indie funding, whatever, and then about 90% should just bootstrap. It’s directionally correct. It’s directionally accurate. As Braden Dennis said on the show a couple of weeks ago, “This 2-20-200 validation framework is similar, directionally accurate.” The idea here is that there are three steps, three stages that can happen in order as you try to validate or invalidate a startup idea, and the numbers stand for the approximate number of hours that I think you’re going to spend doing them. So two hours, 20 hours, 200 hours. And the idea here is the first stage of two hours is something you can do relatively quickly. So if you have five different ideas that you’re thinking about evaluating, well then, you spend two hours each to do this very first step. And that first step really involves just implementing the 5 P.M. Idea Validation Framework that I’ve talked about on this podcast. You can Google that if you aren’t aware of it. I’ve recorded a YouTube video about it, and I am including it in my next book, which is about the earliest stages of building and launching a SaaS, and that book is already written, actually. I’m just going back and revising a few elements of it, but 5 P.M. Idea Validation Framework is something that, where you go through several steps and you can do it in literally a couple of hours. So if you have five ideas and you want to spend 10 hours over the course of a weekend, or a week, to just get a little better picture of which of these ideas might be the winner … And when I say winner, I mean better than the others. You go through the two-hour stage of the 2-20-200 framework. 20 hours is where you take it to the next step, and this is where you either do landing page validation, or you speak one-on-one with potential customers, or you do both. I tend to do both when I’m thinking about building a product. The idea, of course, is that if you’re going to have a marketing funnel and a low-touch product, then you put up that landing page and you try to drive traffic, and the way that you’re going to ultimately market the product, and you see what kind of opt-in you get, and you see what kind of traffic you get, and you see how many emails you collect, versus if you’re going to do high-touch sales, and obviously you want to have more conversations, I think doing both is always better. The idea behind 20 hours is, “How long does it take you to put up a landing page and/or reach out to your warm network for these conversations or reach out to your cold network for these conversations?” Set up ads. SEO takes a while, but cold outreach, whatever you’re going to do to start gathering qualitative and quantitative data around this. You’re not just sitting in a research modem like you are with a SEO keyword tool maybe within the two-hour section of this, but you’re getting out and spending more time. This is where, if you have five ideas, you probably don’t want to do all five ideas at the 20-hour mark. It’s just a lot of time to invest, and that’s where the first stage, where it’s only two hours into each idea, is helpful to maybe narrow you down to one or two, and then you move on to this second stage, where you spend 20-ish hours. And then the third stage is the 200-hour stage, and that’s where you think about building an MVP. And, of course, an MVP can be a no-code MVP. It can be a human automation MVP, like I talk about in Start Small, Stay Small, or it can be a full-blown coded MVP, and whether we call it an MVP or a V1 or something to get into the hands of people to see if they like it, what parts of it resonate and what don’t? And honestly, I’m putting together a video course right now for MicroConf that’s going to be out in several months, and I dive more deeply into this because there’s a lot to say about it. But the idea behind the 2-20-200 framework is to level-set in your mind that it’s not just this big amorphous cloud of “Validate.” It is there are specific stages that you can go through. I’m not saying this is the only way to do it. You can validate any way you want, but this is just a repeatable way to think about, “How am I going to go about being a little more confident?” This is the thing, right now, you’re probably 0% confident that this is a great idea. After two hours, are you 10 or 20%? After 20 hours, are you 30, 40%? After 200 hours, do you get to 50, 60, 70%? If it works, maybe. That’s kind of the goal, is to get a little more confidence before you invest a ton of time, tens of hours, if not, hundreds. You get a little more confidence, that the thing might work and that you might actually be building something people want, because that really is the hard part, right, building something people want and are willing to pay for. Credit to Paul Graham for saying, “Building something people want.” I added the and are willing to pay for, but doing that is really hard. I’m not saying everything else is simple, but there certainly is more of a playbook once you’ve done that, and my hope is that the 2-20-200 validation framework can be a sort of … It’s not a playbook per se, but sort of a compass or a guiding light as you think about validating your ideas. All right, my next topic of today is about design by committee and why I have always believed that it is by far the least efficient way to do things and that you just get bland, crappy output. Your art or your product or whatever it is usually sucks if a bunch of people have input into it. One example I can think of is every school project I ever did, where it was a group project, the more people involved, just the worse the quality was, right? Unless it was like a hand-picked group of people who are all on the same page and had the same vision, it was like the vision just tore everybody in different directions. And even at larger companies that I’ve worked at, after Drip was acquired, or with TinySeed, which isn’t a huge company, I tend to keep input to a minimum of, that everybody around here is really smart and competent because that’s what we like to hire, that’s who I want to work with, but I bring in one, maybe two people even to make really big decisions because the moment that I have six, seven, eight, nine people weighing in on a decision, A, it grinds it to a halt, and B, I find the output is subpar. And that two exceptional people who are on the same page with a similar shared vision can build incredible things, but the moment you get to three, four, five, it can often derail that vision. One example of this is a Metallica album called St. Anger. And if you’ve ever watched Some Kind of Monster … That is a documentary. It’s like two and a half hours. It’s actually pretty long, but it’s of Metallica almost breaking up. Is it 20 years ago now? Yeah, it’s probably about 20 years ago, and they bring in basically a therapist, like a … It’s like a marriage counselor. No, he’s actually a sports counselor, but if I recall, they’re paying him at 40 grand a month to be on call, and he’s trying to keep the band together. One of the things that a couple of the bandmates had an issue with was that two of the members of Metallica, Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield, had pretty much written all the songs up until then, and the band’s been together since what, the ’80s, since the early ’80s? So I mean, you’re talking 20 plus years, and these two guys had written almost all the songs and almost all the lyrics. Other people would come in with a riff or whatever, but then they would take it and they’d run with it, and there were some complaints, I think it was mostly from Kirk Hammett who’s one of the guitarists, that they wanted input. And so in this documentary, Some Kind of Monster, it’s pretty fascinating documentary, actually. If you’re at all into their music, it’s cool, but even if not, just seeing the dynamics and the craziness of trying to keep a band together, it’s a fun watch. I’ve seen it a few times, but one thing they do is they are writing the songs together as a group, and you can … It’s just painful. It is just painful to watch them come up with a riff and to hear the song be like, “This is actually a cool song,” and then they’re like, “Cool, so throw out lyrics,” and people are just throwing out random sentences that have nothing to do with each other, and they string them together as the lyrics to these songs. And so if you listen to the lyrics of that album, they’re terrible. They’re terrible, compared to the cohesive … Look, I’m not saying Metallica are the best lyricists at all before that, but at least there’s a story there. At least there’s poetry. At least there’s a cohesiveness to each song prior to that, but on this album, in particular, which … Look, a lot of people hate on this album, especially folks who really are into Metallica. I actually really enjoy the snare sound. It sounds like he’s banging on a beer keg, but kind of has this weird … It’s a different sound, and it has kind of almost a punk-ish vibe, even though they’re playing metal, but I don’t dislike the album specifically about two or three songs that are good, and the rest I would pass on, but even then, the lyrics are awful, and I don’t typically pay attention to lyrics that much in Metallica songs, but it is noticeably cringe. And I think 99, if not 100% of the reason, that is the case, is because they designed this by committee. They didn’t collaborate. They didn’t get two people or three people together and all with the same vision. It was, “You said you wanted to write, and the therapist said that we have to let you write, so let’s sit here and just write stuff out on a sheet of paper. Just call things out.” It almost feels half-hearted, and it certainly feels like they did not put out the best end product they could have because of this one or two people doing it could have done a much better job than the group doing it together. And so why do I bring this up, and why does it relate to startups? Well, back to my point earlier of, whether you’re on a big team or a small team, I feel like some folks are uncertain around what they’re doing and they feel like getting more opinions will add more certainty to that. And what I’ve found in rare exceptions is that the more people get involved, the more noise there is, and more chaos is created. Now, I will say that I’ve found it helpful to kind of semi-crowdsource some naming stuff recently, where I am trying to … I mean, I’ve had to name three books in the past. I guess it’s like maybe year, is that right? Yeah, probably last year, I’ve had to name three books and I’ll have to name a course, and I always want those names to be really good and catchy. And so I do brainstorming and I talk to some people and I go to ChatGPT, and I come up with a list, and then I narrow it down, or I come back three days later when it’s cold, and I start narrowing and narrowing, and then I start asking opinions, but I don’t go and ask 20 people’s opinion. I go to like … I’ll say my inner circle, and it’s like three or four people that I trust, that I know have taste and I know have an understanding of the space, and I say, “Hey, I have this handful of titles.” I don’t give them 50 titles to choose from, but maybe I’ll give them three or four, what I call short titles, which is like The SaaS Playbook, right? That’s the short title, and then I give them three or four subtitles. And with The SaaS Playbook, it’s build a multi-million dollar startup without venture capital. And so I have three or four of my tops that came out of like 50 plus, but it’s usually pretty obvious which of these I think are going to be great, and I get feedback there, and then I iterate, and I might even brainstorm again, then I go a little broader. I might go into the TinySeed Slack, or I might go to a MicroConf Slack, and get some input, and it’s always noisy, right? It’s always fuzzy. You’re guessing like, “Oh, all right, more people like this.” That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best one, I’m going to use it, but there’s a signal there, right? And then maybe after that, I might wind up on Twitter, and at that point, I’m probably trying to more confirm my own favorite pick or have two that are so similar that it maybe doesn’t matter, but I certainly don’t want to go to Twitter with 10 different options because you’re going to get 10% of the people liking each of the 10 options, and then how much good does that actually do you? So I do think that getting a lot of voices and input at a certain point can help, especially the further along it is, right? Let’s say you’re building a feature, you’re trying to figure out how it is complicated, how to build it, you get one or two people together, and you crank on this thing, and you put it out, and it’s art and it’s science, and you’ve got this amazing screenshot or this design that you’re using, then you bring it to some people who maybe kind of know how your product works, so they’re kind of in the space, right? And then you bring it to a few inner circle customers, and then you get broader and broader and broader, but you refine it as you go. So I’m not saying you can’t get other voices involved, but if you start with 10 people trying to design that same screen or that same idea, it is so difficult, so time-consuming to get everyone on the same page in a way that you can then be productive and actually move forward in a way that’s not just compromise. “Well, we all disagree, so let’s just do the thing in the middle,” and the mushy middle is like eating a mayonnaise sandwich. It’s very bland. A note to the listeners, I put mayonnaise on my turkey sandwiches. I also put mustard, and cheese, and often lettuce, and guacamole. I don’t dislike mayonnaise. Last time I said a mayonnaise sandwich, several people thought that I was ragging on mayonnaise, when in fact, what I’m ragging on is a sandwich that is made up of two pieces of white bread and mayonnaise in it. That is the analogy I’m going for when I say a mayonnaise sandwich. If it had turkey in it, I’d call it a turkey sandwich, but in this case, I’m saying, yeah, two pieces of bread with mayonnaise is just very bland. That’s the analogy. That’s all we have time for today. Hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you for coming back this and every week, listening to Startups For the Rest of Us. If you haven’t given a five-star rating in iTunes, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, wherever your greater podcasts are served, really appreciate it. If you have, could you please go to Amazon or Audible and rate The SaaS Playbook as a five-star? You don’t even have to leave a review, I believe, and it helps me continue to progress on my mission to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. I’ve been doing that since I’ve started blogging in 2005, so almost 20 years. Yeah, next year it’ll be 20 years, and each year, as I’ve pushed that boulder up the hill, I’ve been able to increase momentum and grow the audience and grow the number of people that are impacted by this message. At this point, I do it because it changes people’s lives. I want everyone who wants to be an entrepreneur to have the same freedom, purpose, and healthy relationships that you and I do, so I always appreciate any effort you can put forth to help me continue on that mission.

I’m your host, Rob Walling. This week I talk with Braden Dennis, the co-founder of FinChat about their long journey of launching a product with an existing audience. And in fact, if you’ve ever heard me quote the stat that of all the companies I’ve invested in, 170 companies, that less than 5% of them had an audience before they launched their SaaS. FinChat is one of them. And you’ll hear Braden and I talk about the pros and cons of having that audience in this episode. In addition, they also launched a second product and pivoted the entire company to that second product. They’ve been bootstrapped, mostly bootstrapped, and now, they’ve raised venture funding. He and his co-founders have taken a lot of big risks and made big bets, and they’re doing pretty well with it. It’s a really interesting conversation today. I hope you stick around. Before we dive into that, I want to let you know it’s your last chance to get tickets to MicroConf Atlanta. The event is April 21st through the 23rd. Speakers include Rand Fishkin from SparkToro, Asia Orangio from DemandMaven, Stephen Steers, myself, and Dr. Sherry Walling. It’s going to be hosted and emceed by me and Lianna Patch of Punchline Copy. I’m also going to be doing a fireside chat with Ben Chestnut, the co-founder of MailChimp. He does not do very many public appearances, and so I’m very excited to host him at MicroConf this year. Microconf.com/us, if you’re interested in grabbing tickets. Again, tickets are going to sell out soon. So if you’re thinking about joining me and about 225 of your closest bootstrap founder, friends, head to microconf.com/us. MicroConf is hiring a director of marketing and operations. You can come work directly with me to help me refine, and expand, and execute on our growth strategy. We have a lot of exciting things going on over the next one to two to three years, frankly, at MicroConf, including a lot of new digital product launches. So if you have a strong background in online marketing, marketing digital courses, course creation, managing a small team and you’re interested in working directly with me to help shape the future of bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies, head to microconf.com/jobs and you’ll see the listing for this as well as our community manager opening. If you’re interested, please apply and let’s have a conversation. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Braden. Braden, welcome to the show.  Braden Dennis:Rob, it’s so good to be here.  Rob Walling:So FinChat.io is your company. You started it with three co-founders. Your H One is the complete research platform for global equities. Do you want to give us an idea of where you stand today, what phase the business is at.  Braden Dennis:For sure. So we are a team of 11 people, soon to be 12 in a few days. Seven figures in ARR company, and the platform is for investment research. So we primarily serve professional, sophisticated institutional investors. And we’ve been going more and more kind of upmarket through that process.  Rob Walling:And you’ve raised a million and a half seed. Would you call it a seed or a pre-seed round?  Braden Dennis:Yeah. I guess, there’s no rules in raising money is one thing I’ve learned. I almost say that it was like a hybrid of a seed and a series A in terms of where we were in scale, but it was a tool for us to get to our next milestones. And we didn’t need more, we didn’t need less. It just felt like a really good number for us.  Rob Walling:We’re going to talk about a lot of things today. Building a second product, raising your round, venture versus bootstrapping. ‘Cause you’ve been through a lot in the past couple of years. I want to start by going back to when FinChat was initially launched, it was actually called Stratosphere, right? Stratosphere.io. And you have, is it one of the most popular personal finance podcasts in Canada? You started with an audience, and you built a SaaS, and one reason I want to touch on this is if folks follow me on Twitter or listen to me rant on this podcast, I often say, “Look, if you have an audience, great. That is a great advantage. But if you don’t, don’t go build one for SaaS.” If you’re going to do info products, or courses, or books, of course. But for SaaS, I think it’s more trouble than it’s worth and the time would be better spent doing SEO, or product development, or anything else. But roll us back there. Tell us about your podcast and then how Stratosphere came out of it.  Braden Dennis:Well, first I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. The podcast network owns two shows, and so I do run it as a separate business. It is an advertising business. If I was to dream up the best lifestyle business, it is truly that. It’s like a few hours of work each week. And I’ve been doing it now for a long time. I was looking at it the other day and I’ve been doing podcasts in various forms for 10 years now. And when we launched it for a while, there was basically no one listening. And then in 2019, since it was about investing, it was starting to take off. But it was taking off right before the big wave brought us even bigger in 2020 when people were doing self-directed investing. And so it’s been a fantastic project, it’s been every single week for 370 episodes now. So I think we’re about half of your catalog.  Rob Walling:It’s still a lot, man. Good for you.  Braden Dennis:But you can recognize that it is a grind, but I really do enjoy it. I get a lot of career satisfaction out of it. And then to roll that over to the product, to what you said, I say to people, “It gave me a great zero to one type of audience to show the product to, iterate on. Have like really forgiving users for your MVP was great, and I don’t take that for granted. I think it’s amazing to have that. But you do outgrow that audience, and as a business we outgrew it pretty quick because we are starting to focus on more upmarket B2B type clients. And so it gave us a great zero to one, but it is not going to be the thing that gets you 1 to 10 or anything like that. So I agree that it shouldn’t be a main priority for SaaS founders.  Rob Walling:And so you had this audience and it’s self-directed investors, kind of people interested in personal finance and investing and you built a SaaS. And what was it, was it like researching stocks?  Braden Dennis:It was the tool that I wish I had to save me time for the podcast research essentially, which was just how can I aggregate more historical financials from public companies across the whole world into one place that I can view them really quickly. And the whole concept was just like Yahoo Finance people were really familiar with, but it’s so ad invested and just really limited coverage. And just only has huge scale because they’ve been so good at SEO, and anytime someone searches up a company or a stock, they come up first. But I was trying to build just the MVP of how can I bring in financials from companies around the world in some sort of API feed, and then build Yahoo Finance on steroids to show my podcast audience. It was not some grand vision or product plan really.  Rob Walling:Right. And you mentioned you built it, you launch it, people are using it. You decide to go up market. Why was that?  Braden Dennis:Well, for all the reasons that you talk about in this podcast, anytime you have really low-price products, you face a lot of churn. It’s really, really hard to scale something when people are paying nine bucks a month, which was the original plan. Right? And so this should come to your listeners as no surprise that as a founder, it’s your job to learn and iterate. Your first plan is never going to be the concrete plan, and our plan right now moving forward is not going to be the plan in two, three years. It’s literally our job to iterate as we go. And so that’s kind of how we found ourselves here.  Rob Walling:Got it. And so the audience, as you said, was your zero to one, it got you started. And if I recall, we first talked when you were somewhere around 7 to 10K MRR. And I believe you had gotten bigger, and churn had done some damage ’cause again, $9 a month is, as you said, it’s hard to scale even when you have access to tens of thousands of people or whatever through a podcast. And it was maybe a year later, so I’m thinking, when did you think about start for the rest of his drinking game? When did you think about launching a second product? Because you and I talked about it and usually, as Ruben Gomez and I had spent an entire episode talking about… Usually my response is, “Don’t do that,” and you have to convince me otherwise, right? But you guys did and you executed on it really intelligently. I believe I actually used you as an example in that episode of people who had talked me into it. You were one, Jordan Gaul and I think there was a third. But walk us through that in how maybe ChatGPT going live had an impact on your thinking.  Braden Dennis:For sure. So the product was called Stratosphere, the company that we originally connected on and got into TinySeed with. Like you said, for context, around seven K in MRR at the time. Lots of churn… Growing, but not a venture scale idea or anything like that. And in the April-ish of 2023, last year, one of my co-founders was like, “We have been aggregating so much financial data. This product’s amazing. What happens if you just talk to it?” We had heard whispers of Bloomberg, the large incumbent trying to build BloombergGPT, but they just have a white paper. What if the small startup beats them to their game? And we did, and it went viral. And so we launched it, we bought the [inaudible 00:10:24]… I couldn’t have bought a domain name faster than FinChat because it was perfect, right? It was the domain for the space. And we launched it in April, and we had 65,000 signups on hour 46 or something of it being live. It had gone viral on LinkedIn, it had made its way around Twitter and stuff like this. And it had far surpassed just my reach. That’s when you really know. And we recognized, like, “Okay, this product’s cool. But everything behind it, investors want to know the source.” So when you search up, like, “What was Amazon’s revenue last year?” People want to know the source, and audit it, and go back to the filing that it came for. If people are doing this, especially at a professional scale, I was like, “Perfect. We already built that product. It’s called Stratosphere.” So we brought that in as the layer behind it, and it became one cohesive product. So it was more so just like we built two different styles of front ends and then realized, “Hey, if we just bring them together, this is actually the most compelling product that the market has right now.” And it was a scary decision. You and I talked about it. And we decided in an afternoon, we’re like, “This is too obvious.” Right? Like “This is too obvious, and there’s no sense of waiting another day to think about it because this is amazing.” There’s no risk in terms of we don’t have to dish the old product, we’re going to merge it over. And so I think I call it the low-risk experiment gone right, because we shipped that experiment in three weeks. I think it was like two to three weeks, we shipped it from zero to one to domain to live to 65,000 users in two and a half weeks. And so that’s really the key is if that took us four months, oh, gosh, that would’ve been a gigantic distraction at that time.  Rob Walling:Yep. And that’s the thing that I see with a lot of folks who do launch that second product is they’re launching it to escape. Usually, it’s to escape something that’s not working and they’re not putting in the hard work on the first thing. And then they take four months, five months, six months to build it, and launch it. And they think about it, and then it is not. You called it what a low-risk experiment gone right, it becomes a high risk experiment. And whether it goes wrong or right, now, you’re six months down the line and you have something that most people won’t have had the intersect. And you had hard work, luck, and skill that all took this. I don’t want anybody to think, “Oh, Braden got lucky. Stratosphere got lucky with FinChat.” It’s like, “No, it was all these things.” Because you launched it in two to three weeks, it wasn’t 30, 40 hours of dev. Somebody put in a lot of hours, your co-founder. And the skill, let’s talk about skill. That’s kind of how your preparation, it’s like, “Hey, you guys had the knowledge. You guys had the data.” Without all the data you pulled into Stratosphere, there is no FinChat. That makes sense. I couldn’t have built FinChat on my own in two to three weeks because I didn’t have all the background that you guys had. So I’m calling this out, so listeners who are listening don’t think to themselves, “Oh, well I can launch a second product too.” You are again a counter example, but with good reason because you could do it quickly. And it was a low-risk experiment that if it didn’t go right, you would’ve kept pushing on Stratosphere. Right? So FinChat took off in a way… It wasn’t just users, right? I mean, it was people clamoring for the data and you were like, “Wow, there’s revenue here whether we’re going to close it today or in a month.” And so you eventually just merged them. And so if you go to Stratosphere.io now, it redirects you to FinChat, right? And it tells you, “We’ve merged your account settings and dashboards onto FinChat.” Was that part a hard decision at all to merge it in? Was it like, “Well, do we shut it down? Do we run two products?” What was the thinking there?  Braden Dennis:Because we knew we were going to roll in that product with the exact same UI, UX experience other than the background, gray is a little bit different. It was an identical experience for those previous users and that’s why we felt really confident. And we even told people, like, “Hey, this is happening.” A lot of people replies on my Twitter being like, “Dude, no. I love the Stratosphere units interface.” And I said, “I promise you. When we launch this tomorrow, I’m going to reply to this thread and be like, ‘See'” And that’s exactly what I did. And they’re just like, “You know what? It’s actually better. You tweaked a few little things that actually improved it.” And as we should, right? As you get a chance to put a fresh coat of paint on stuff. But we didn’t change the experience and that’s really why our users were like, “Okay, the domain’s different. The URL is different. And now, I have all these new features with the AI chat as well.” It’s a no-brainer.  Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

There’s a lot of similarities between the two. But it’s a great split test, and you think about in any 10 successes or 10 failures, like, “Was it the founder? Was it the market? Was it the product? What are those magic factors that all come together?” I summarize them as hard work, luck, and skill, but we know it’s very amorphous. You had two similar products in one just up into the right. I’ve seen the graphs. Do you have any sense of why that happened the way it did?  Braden Dennis:Before, we were not truly bringing anything differentiated to the market to professionals. We were bringing something differentiated to the market for retail investors who hadn’t had a chance to get a professional accessible research interface. But for those who have been in the business a long time, paying 25 grand a year for each Bloomberg terminal. These incumbents have been building this technology for 30, 40 years and they’ve kind of thought of every use case. And so the expectation for those users is just so much higher. And now, it was something different. Now, I don’t even have to go learn Bloomberg 2.0 as I can just talk to it the same way that I talk to my associate or the intern to pull up a graph comparing these two companies. It’s like, “Hey, can you quickly compare Google Cloud’s business to Amazon Cloud’s business? Build a chart and also, layer in operating margins ’cause I want to know why there’s such a big discrepancy in profitability.” Those are very casual conversations that happen in the office for these people. And then they’re just like type it into FinChat and it creates it. And they just had this magical experience for the first time. And so I think differentiation is a roundabout way of saying that it was different for the first time and the timing was right. So I think that that’s probably what it comes down to.  Rob Walling:Timing feels like a big piece that people… Everyone’s talking about GPTs, and AI, and LLMs and so it’s going to tend to get noticed at least. And look, if it got noticed and it wasn’t a great product, then it doesn’t go anywhere. Right? As people look at it and blah. But it really is taking advantage of a moment in time that you were at the right place and seized the opportunity. You saw the opportunity, you seized it. You did it quickly. And you rode that wave is what it feels like, right? And sometimes, this is where I always say there’s some luck involved because you weren’t lucky in going viral. You were lucky in the sense that GPT just came out the moment that you had this product. Let’s say you had built Stratosphere five years ago, seven years ago, what were the tech waves that it was AR/VR and it was crypto. Maybe you’d have done a blockchain strategy, whatever. It’s like you did happen to have that, but you also had the ability to execute so fast that led you to raise your funding ground that we talked earlier. So you took money from TinySeed, right? So you’ve been bootstrapped. You’ve been, what I call, mostly bootstrapped, which is like, I don’t know, 100 grand to 500 grand is kind of mostly bootstrapped, usually. There’s no fine line, but that’s kind of in my head what I think about. And then now, you’ve literally raised venture. You want to talk us through that decision because as a entrepreneur, self-made with your podcast, and you’ve bootstrapped that, we know that you could have bootstrap Stratosphere/FinChat. But you decided to go in between and then take the full step. So talk us through your thinking there.  Braden Dennis:And what feels like a short time, I know it’s been several years now. I’ve seen all three of that bootstrapped, mostly bootstrapped, and going venture scale. And even on the same company, which is kind of even more bizarre. But there’s a couple pieces there, right? I say to founders who are thinking about raising money and you mentioned that, what is it 1, 9 and 90 rule? What is that one again? That’s the 1% should go venture.  Rob Walling:Should at least consider venture, they’re probably venture ready. And then about 9%, I think, should consider some type of funding ’cause it just makes it a little easier to get off the ground. And that maybe is angel friends and family, maybe it’s TinySeed type money, but it’s non venture money. And then I think about 90% of tech companies, startups, and stuff should probably just bootstrap. And again, you and I talked, it’s directionally correct. It’s not the exact numbers, but yeah, probably 10 times more should do this and 10 times more should do that.  Braden Dennis:Yeah, those kind of rule of thumb directionally correct things. I think that this one’s spot on, and it’s just kind of important to be honest with yourself because along that way… What we’ve actually described, the whole genesis of this. When it was a product for my audience, it was a bootstrapped business. It was not even a mostly bootstrapped business, it was fully… This is a cool side project turned main time project that we could generate a decent living for ourselves, basically. It’s not going to support a big team or anything like that, but a good bootstrap project. Two things are actually really working, we had a successful pivot up market to, “Okay, this is not a venture idea. But this could hit 1 million in ARR, maybe two,” that kind of thing. And so we were being honest with ourself about what that outcome looked like. And I even had angels and VCs reach out and I just said, “Look, I’m not getting on the venture route because this isn’t a venture company.” I’m an investor myself, it’s my job to be a steward of your capital. I became investor first before company operator. And then when FinChat happened and that explosion happened, our ambitions grew with the opportunity of recognizing it. If you were to see me and my co-founders call about level setting around the ambitions that we wanted to go to, they changed in a massive way in six months. In terms of what we thought was possible, the company we wanted to build, and the company that we thought that there was an opportunity on. So it’s really just being honest with yourself because if you put yourself in the wrong path for your ambitions, or the company, or the market opportunity, you get a lot of conflicting incentives with investors, yourself, what you want to build. And that’s not really good for anyone, no one wins in that situation. And when you’re raising money, I now, am a steward of capital and it’s my fiduciary duty to go for a big outcome. And so that’s what we’re going to do.  Rob Walling:Often, when I talk to folks similar who ask me, “Should I raise funding?” I know that you get that question. I tell them, “Look, there’s no right or wrong answer. Know what you’re getting into at each layer. Know that it’s not undoable. Once you take venture, especially like you’re on the venture track, you’ve removed some optionality and that’s okay. Just know that.” So in my case, if I were thinking about it, I can stay bootstrapped for as long as I want. I have all the options. The moment I take any capital, whether it is from a TinySeed, or friends and family, or angels, or whatever, I’ve made a choice. I can no longer be bootstrapped, I have now made that choice and it’s a one-way door. And then once you do venture, it’s similar. So that’s where bootstrapping as long as you can, as long as it makes sense. I think it gives you, not only the optionality, but I can help you discover about the business. Some businesses you’re two, three years in and finally you’re like, “Oh, now, I see there’s a venture opportunity.” Sometimes it takes that long. But if you took venture or you took a big round of funding early on, three months in where you’re still trying to find product market fit, you just burn through that cash. You’ve removed your optionality and you’re now like, “Well, I got to grow fast, so I got to spend all this money.” And then finally, a product market fit, no money in the bank. Right? So that’s why I tend to be pretty pro bootstrapping, not just because I don’t see venture as an incredibly viable option, I’ve never been anti venture, but I just think too many people think it’s the default. When I say 1, 9, 90, I want people to have an order of magnitude of when I speak at events, and I say that, people are surprised. I thought everyone raised venture. No, and everyone shouldn’t, right?  Braden Dennis:It’s ’cause those are the big headlines you see and those are the kind of vanity metrics that a lot of founders, especially in certain areas are showing off. Raising money in itself is not a milestone, it’s a tool. I love the Craig from Castos, it’s a tool to live in the future. Like that’s exactly… I don’t think I’ve heard of a better saying on what funding is ’cause in itself, it’s not a milestone. It doesn’t create any intrinsic value. And in fact, it might be destructive for intrinsic value for any potential for you to have a successful exit or outcome. Because if you try to sell it for less than what the cap you raised at, then there’s a lot of issues with that, especially if you’re signing traditional venture capital documents, you sign over a lot of control. You create a board, you create… it’s not a milestone, it’s really not. It’s a tool and decision for the company you want to build.  Rob Walling:Yep. I often tell people “It’s not the finish line, it’s the starting line. It’s a new starting line.” I’m like, “Okay. Now, we’re going to scale up.”  Braden Dennis:And to add on that, it’s one of the only irreversible mistakes is messing up your cap table.  Rob Walling:That’s for sure. We’ve seen some come through TinySeed, man. Where it’s like, “Wait-”  Braden Dennis:We fail, we make mistakes daily. It’s like in our culture to fail, to ship fast, to move fast, to fail fast. That’s the only thing you can’t mess up is your cap table.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s so permanent. When we got on the call today, you and I were chatting beforehand. And I had this whole outline of like, “Oh, let’s cover these things. I think these are the most interesting parts of your story so far.” And something you said to me is, “I just made a really hard decision as the CEO of this company and it’s to shut down our API business.” So do you want to give folks context around, you have a web interface, you have an API, and you’ve had a lot of traction with the API. But I believe yesterday, you just decided we’re not accepting new customers. Right? Just talk us through that decision because it’s a hard one. Being a founder is making hard decisions with incomplete information, it’s a big strategic decision. But it sounds like you’re convinced it’s the right way to go.  Braden Dennis:Yes. And to give you even more context, I basically realized the writing was all on the wall yesterday and made the decision this morning. That’s how quick I’ve had to make the decision. And some people say, “Maybe sleep on it. Maybe that’s too impulsive.” But as founders, we’re seeing signals for months, and months, and months, and months. It’s not like crap at the fan yesterday, I’m shutting it down today. Right? That’s that founder gut decision and making the decision fast and concisely. Whether it’s wrong or right, you’re going to navigate and you’re going to move forward with it, I think, is really important. ‘Cause the writing’s been on the wall for this for a while. Say six months ago, we saw a lot of interest from fintechs on, “Hey, can we bring FinChat into our platform?” Say, you’re like a broker, a stock trading platform. You’re like the Robin Hood of country X, Y, and Z. And we learned the wrong lesson really quick, which was huge six figure deals, quarter million… We signed a deal for a quarter million dollars a year. And for us, we grew up selling $9 a month subscriptions. This is star struck. We hit gold. This is product market fit. The inbound is exceptional, and so we ran with it. What we learned over the next six months and up including until this morning is every deal was very custom. The sales cycle, it was not just slow, it was impossible with the legalities around it, them being so regulated. And our ability to actually execute something that we’re really proud of, we became consultants. And what that did for a team of, at the time, seven, eight now, 12 people, is you completely lose focus on the company that we wanted to build. We know we still want to go up market. We tasted up market, we like it. We like going up market and we learned some good lessons, but we know it’s just not going to be that product. So we decided we’re not taking any more inbound for this. Also, I’ve had probably the worst six months of my whole time building this company during that time, and my co-founders agree. Even though we’re making lots of money from it, we were really not enjoying that part of it and we were really stressed out that we were going to be able to deliver that at scale. And so we just said, “Screw it.” There’s a larger opportunity upmarket for an enterprise option here on the FinChat platform, not off platform, which is way more scalable and it’s something we actually know we’re good at. So that’s kind of like my thought process around here, but the learnings and decision making at speed, I think, are what has gotten us here and will continue to get us forward in the future.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s a good way to summarize it is learning and decision making at high velocity, high speed. Einar Vollset and I talk often about what do the TinySeed founders that we talk to have in common, the ones that are really doing well. And there’s a decisiveness, there is doing a lot of things quickly. And usually, for the most part, working on the right things. Maybe it’s not 100%, but maybe it’s 75 or 80. And if you’re doing enough things at high velocity, something’s going to catch. And that is something that you and your team are exceptional at. And I don’t actually know if it’s you or if it’s your team ’cause I don’t see the inner workings of… You have three co-founders, we’re actually going to talk about that in a second. So four of you total. And the thing I’m surprised by, I’ll say this, let’s dive into the four-co-founder thing. One of the things we talk about in TinySeed or even just in MicroConf that we see in state of independent SaaS is that I believe the number is 90% of our MicroConf TinySeed crew is one or two-person companies, which makes sense. One or two co-founder companies, I should say. And then it’s another handful… It might even be more than 90. Actually, it might be like 92, and then there’s like 5% that are three co-founders. And then just one or two that are four people. Because usually, if you get four people together, they don’t make decisions quickly. There’s too many cooks in the kitchen, right? And there are other things that are, not a mess, but there are other things that make it an antipattern or an exception to what we see. That hasn’t been the case with you, with FinChat, with Stratosphere. Is that there are four of you, but it seems like you function pretty well, at least from the outside. And it seems like you move very quickly, you make decisions fast. And also, you execute very quickly. Right? Talk us through that sentiment of why start it with four? How has it worked out? And would you do that again? Just all your thinking around it.  Braden Dennis:Great questions. Well, first of all, my co-founders, there’s four of us, and these guys are my best friends, including my CTO, who we’ve literally been best friends since we were 10 years old. And so we have kind of complete alignment, and when I get everyone on a call this morning for making this hard decision, it’s just like, “Yeah, of course.” Like “Of course.” We’ve been in it, we’ve been involved. There’s no one catching up on the crap that’s been hitting the fan. There’s no one that’s just tuning in for the first time on making a really hard decision. And I think that that’s really important, just constant communication, constant talking. And one thing that we do is we have a monthly set founders call, which is important because it’s four of us. But every few months, sometimes more if it’s called for… I just call the guys together and just get a realignment of what we want in terms of an outcome. For those three different stages of raising money, not raising money, kind of raising money, it’s like, “What do you guys really want?” Because if we’re not all aligned on that, then you’re going to run into a lot of problems. Even if it’s just two co-founders, even… Four co-founders, three co-founders, two co-founders, you got to be aligned on what you really want to build in terms of the company size. Do you want 100 employees. Or do you want zero employees? These are really important decisions to think about before you start building. I just think we get along so great. Everyone has their own really unique talents to offer. At the end of the day, as my role as CEO, they’re leaning on me to make the hard decisions. And have built that trust over a long time that they know I’m going to do, at least, what I believe is the right thing.  Rob Walling:And what’s the distribution of work? ‘Cause one of your co-founders is a CTO, as you said. So we know he’s writing code and building stuff. And you’re the CEO, so you’re doing, I’m guessing, operations and a lot of the decision making and driving it forward. Sales calls too, it sounds like?  Braden Dennis:Lots of that. Too many of that.  Rob Walling:Well, can you ever do too many sales calls?  Braden Dennis:Check out my calendar and maybe. Yeah.  Rob Walling:What do your other two co-founders do?  Braden Dennis:So Adrian’s our COO, he’s done a lot of operations. He helped build out that data team. Since he’s an accountant, he was the perfect fit. I’ve been actually moving over a lot of the operations to unlock more of my time to him to move into a more COO type role. And then Kevin is chief product officer. But him and Ryan are basically CTO one and CTO two. That’s how it works. So two developers that are technical and have a deep understanding, but also have a lot of chops for people skills and building teams. They like that stuff and they’re good at it, so it’s helpful.  Rob Walling:Braden Dennis, you are BradoCapital, B-R-A-D-O Capital on Twitter. And FinChat.io is what you’re building. Thanks so much for joining me, man. It was a great conversation.  Braden Dennis:No, thanks for having me. I’ve been listening to the podcast for… Oh, shoot. I don’t know. Years and years, and I’ve enjoyed it very much. So happy to be here.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s great to have you on this side of the mic. Thanks so much to Braden for showing up this week and giving his time to help educate the mostly bootstrapped founder community. If you haven’t checked out our YouTube channel, it’s youtube.com/microconf. I’m releasing a new video there every week. It is completely custom created, bespoke, as they might say across the pond. And it’s different content. It’s similar to the podcast, but it’s tighter focus, right? It’s 10 or 15 minutes focused on a single topic, and it’s like having a second podcast. That’s youtube.com/microconf if you want to check it out. Thank you for listening. This is Rob Walling, signing off from episode 705.","PublishedAt":"March 19, 2024","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-705-from-bootstrapped-to-mostly-bootstrapped"},{"Title":"Episode 704 | Landing Pages, Buying a SaaS, the Right Tech Stack, and More Listener Questions","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 704 | Landing Pages, Buying a SaaS, the Right Tech Stack, and More Listener Questions\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t35:27\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 35:27 | Recorded on March 12, 2024\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 704, join Rob Walling for another solo adventure where he answers listener questions.

I’m Rob Walling, and in this week’s episode, I’m going to answer some listener questions. I’m going to mix it up this week. I’m going to break all the rules, going crazy, running with scissors up in here, and I am going to answer only text questions. I have text questions dating back to May of last year, so that is eight or nine months, if I’m doing math correctly on the fly. So, I’m going to dig in to a few of those just to get into the backlog. But I’d imagine that in the next listener question episode, I’ll get back to the old way of doing audio and video questions first. As always, head to startupsfortherestofus.com, click ask a question in the top nav if you want to send a question into the show. But before we get into the episode, I want to invite you to MicroConf Early Stage SaaS Sales Strategies. It’s an online event we’re hosting March 12th and 13th of 2024. It runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Time on those two days. And there will be sessions all focused on early stage SaaS sales led by Rachel Leow, Craig Hewitt, Daniel Ebert, Sam Howard. I’ll be MCing, and we’re going to cover strategies to boost your close rate, build a sustainable sales process, and figure out how to overcome the challenges of selling as a technical founder. We’ll also have daily Founder mixer sessions where you’ll get to meet other attendees to network and chat about what you’re working on. Tickets are inexpensive and they are available at microconfremote.com. And with that, let’s dive into the episode. Let’s dive into my first listener question. This one’s from just a few weeks ago from Lee. Lee says, “Hey, Rob, on a recent episode of Startups For The Rest Of Us, you mentioned that you don’t like when people use Apple or Basecamp as examples for comparing to their startup. Comparison to Apple seems obvious to me. But why Basecamp/37signals? They seem way more of a model for bootstrappers to emulate. Thanks for that question, Lee. So, the reason I don’t like when people use any type of outlier company is usually you are not in their position. The issue with Basecamp is not that they’re not a solid, mostly bootstrap company, they took a small bit of funding in the early days from Jeff Bezos. I’m not sure if you heard that whole story. But the problem is that Basecamp or the founders can come out and say anything. And they can say things like, “We don’t market,” or, “We don’t have any type of marketing analytics,” or, “We don’t check opens on our emails.” They could say, I don’t know that they’ve ever said this, “But we don’t do cold outreach. We don’t focus on SEO. We don’t care about marketing. We just built a great product.” And some of those things they’ve said, and some haven’t. I’m not trying to put words in their mouth, but they can say whatever. They have built one of the most successful bootstrapped businesses of all time. People estimate it’s doing what? A 100, 200, 300 some hundreds of millions a year in ARR is estimated. Jason Fried on the MicroConf stage said it throws off tens of millions a year in net profit and that was six, seven, eight years ago. And you know it’s probably grown since then. But the problem is they, as Jason Fried said, I said, “What were the keys to success?” He says, “We did some things right, but timing and we got a little lucky. Luck and timing were one and two.” And I think that’s a great and honest assessment of why Basecamp succeeded. If you started your SaaS in what ’04, ’05 and you get a little lucky, then you too cannot market and not check email, open and click rates, and not check analytics numbers. I don’t remember all. But it was things like this that I’ve heard them say. And so, then developers who don’t want to market, or who don’t want to focus on email opens and click rates, who don’t want to do blocking and tackling that 95% of the successful businesses I see doing, they use these quotes or that sentiment to justify it because they say, “Well, look, Basecamp’s successful and they didn’t do it.” The problem is you’re not Basecamp. It’s the same thing with Apple. Hey, Steve Jobs said X, Y, Z. And it’s like, but you’re not Steve Jobs. Keep in mind when he said that he was worth a $100 million. And he already had a massive company and he was co-founder with the guy who invented certainly the invention of that decade. But you could argue that the invention of one of the top few inventions of the past 50 years, the personal computer. So, that’s why I have an issue with it. But keep in mind I like and respect Jason Fried. And DHH sometimes says things that are pretty inflammatory that I don’t agree with, but they’ve built a hell of a business and I have respect for what they’ve built. The issue is they have really strong opinions about things. And I sometimes think that they would’ve been successful either way, whether they had or had not done those things, but most people are not. Most founders, especially those that “just want to build a great product,” need to get out of their own head, they need to get out of their basement, and they need to start talking to customers, asking them what they need, trying to solve a problem, building shipping iteratively. There’s all different ways you can do it. Basecamp never did that. And that’s cool. They truly scratched their own itch. And that was a thing early on where they were saying, “We scratched their own itch so everyone should.” And it’s like that is one good approach. But there are seven different approaches for finding ideas and problems to solve. I actually outlined all of these in a recent YouTube video. They’re doing really well on the MicroConf YouTube channel, Microconf.com/youtube if you want to check it out. And I think it’s something like seven ways to find SaaS ideas or proven ways or something. I have written that up as well. It’s going to be a chapter of my book that is the precursor of The SaaS Playbook. So, it’s the earlier stage stuff of finding ideas and validating. But anyways, that’s why I don’t like it when people use Basecamp as an example because usually it’s to justify an opinion or justify an approach to business that I just don’t see working for anyone else. And I want to state like DHH, Jason Fried, they are TinySeed mentors. They invested in one of the TinySeed funds. So, there’s nothing against them or the way they handle things. It’s just I think as someone just getting started, imagining that since they did it worked and it will work for you, I think is a mistake. I got a really nice note from a reader of The SaaS Playbook. He says, “Hi, Rob. This is not a question, but I wanted to send you a big thank you for The SaaS Playbook. I just read it in one go and I’m sure I’ll come back to many of the topics when relevant. I absolutely loved the book and how succinctly and to the point it’s written. I’m a B2C founder myself. Most of the insights are still very relevant. Although you’ve convinced me that my next company should probably be B2B. I’m trying to do that one founder at a time.” One B2C founder at a time trying to convert you. So, thank you for that note. If you haven’t read The SaaS Playbook, it’s available at Saasplaybook.com. It has actually just crossed 20,000 copies sold, which just feels incredible. And it’s picking up momentum. And probably every day, every other day I’m seeing folks talk about it on Twitter or Reddit and recommending it. And it’s that word of mouth that really drives book sales at this point. So, I appreciate it if you check it out. And if you have already purchased the book, would love it if you’d head to Audible or Amazon, and just give it a five star review or five star rating. You don’t have to type in a review because that also helps people find it. My next question is from Anonymous and he says, “Hello, Rob. I admire your work in the small SaaS space. I find myself stuck in a comfortable and happy job and I’m wondering how best to join the scene. I’m living my childhood dream at my day job. It’s a stable job, lucrative and enjoyable. It’s in a hobby I really enjoy. It’s basically the perfect fit. Between ambition, a desire for more money, and an earlier retirement, and seeing the success of some friends and family who were entrepreneurs, I would still love to own something. I could buy something and focus on automating the activities away, but MicroAcquire looks to have turned into a bit of a wasteland of cheap AI flip jobs.” Wow, I haven’t been on there in quite a while, so that’s interesting to hear that is as his sentiment. Back to the email, “I could be a consultant to bootstrap businesses, but my day job is more lucrative on an hourly basis and there are zero missed invoices. I have considered booking a ticket to MicroConf. I’m highly confident I can be of value to the community. I am sure I’m not the first person you’ve met who is interested but tempted by comfort aside from just take the leap of faith. Any thoughts from your experience?” A couple thoughts. I think you should come to MicroConf and you should be around founders. One of the reasons MicroConf is so different is that the vast majority of people have a real business. It’s not a bunch of wannapreneurs like so many of the SaaS or startup conferences you go to where it’s people walking around looking for permission, asking for funding. MicroConf is real entrepreneurs building real products to sell to real customers for real money. It’s our people. It’s the folks who would listen to Startups For The Rest Of Us, and take that leap and buy a $1,000, $1,200 ticket, and fly somewhere and make a hotel reservation. These are people who are willing to take action and do it. And so, I think if you’re looking for some motivation, being around those types of people for two and a half days, hearing the talks, having the conversations, I think is highly motivating. If that doesn’t get you unstuck, I don’t know what will. I don’t know you and how you work mentally or how you process all this, but I think that would be a big win. And there are still some tickets to Atlanta here, and it’s just about two months. That’s at MicroConf.com/us. That event will sell out. So, I wouldn’t wait if you’re going to do it. The other thing is something that I’ve said when I’ve had similar questions like this in the past. I guess from my perspective, it was a burning desire and need, and that got me through the hard times because it’s going to be a lot of work. And it’s going to be a lot of things you don’t want to do in order to get to the place that you want to be. And so, if you’re not highly motivated to do it, I just don’t know why you would stick with it through the ups and the downs, and whether it’s nights and weekends, or watching your savings drain if you quit without a product already in place. I’m trying not to view it just through my lens of how I did it, but I’ve talked to maybe a handful of entrepreneurs, half a dozen, 10, 12 about this topic. Asked them, “Do you think you could have made it without a burning desire?” And everyone’s been like, “No, it was too hard. I wanted to give up, but X, Y, Z thing got me to the next stage or kept me pushing on this product, or pivoting, or whatever it is.” For me, it was a desire to quit my day job, to have equity, to see what it was like to be an entrepreneur, and I didn’t like working for other people. And that’s usually the story that I hear about folks who start as bootstrappers. And then at a certain point, the dopamine comes from doing interesting things, creating, shipping things into the world and having an impact. And you start to be like, “Oh, well a couple hundred grand a year isn’t as interesting as a million a year. Oh, @2 million a year, $3 million a year.” And you start to get good at it, and then you start to love it and need it. And if you went back to work for someone as just a director of something or other, a manager of something or other where you’re, I’ll just say more of a cog in a wheel. I’m not saying you are now, but if you went back to a job, it would be tremendously unfulfilling like the volume was turned down to two after volume being turned up to eight, nine or 10 for so many years. But I don’t know, there may be entrepreneurs out there who didn’t have that burning desire and just kept going because they just did. I just have a hard time myself with that paradigm. So, if you’re listening to this and you’re a successful entrepreneur, and you have bootstrapped a startup or done something super interesting, and you’re in a similar situation where you weren’t super motivated to do it, but you did it because you wanted to and then it worked out, please write in questions at Startupsfortherestofus.com. I’d love to hear about your experience and how you made it through. I would almost think that if there are folks out there, and there probably are that are out there that have this experience, they almost launched a side project that maybe took off and they got a little lucky. And it’s okay to get lucky. I’m not taking anything away from that. I wish I got lucky with more things I did. But that’s okay. So, maybe that’s what you need original poster. I’m keeping this person anonymous. But maybe that is what you need, is to launch some things that are fun that if they work out, hey, great. And if they don’t, then you just let them go. Kind of the typical indie hacker project where someone launches it, puts it on product hunt, Hacker News, Reddit. And then if it doesn’t catch, which most don’t, they just abandon it or they autopilot it and add their new things such that they have this portfolio of products each doing $300 a month. So, yeah, I think that’s how I would think about it. And I definitely, if you love your job, I wouldn’t go and try to freelance, or be a consultant, or whatever. I don’t think that’s going to make any happier. I think it’s going to be product income or starting an actual, a startup where you’re selling a product, not just dollar for hours, that would make any kind of difference in your life. So, thanks for writing that email. I think it’s an interesting question and one that hopefully I’ve learned some insight onto. But obviously there are folks out there, if you’re out there and you have had success when you were in his situation, I would love to hear from you. My next question is from Pedro about an early access landing page. “Hey, Rob, thanks for the great content. It’s been incredibly helpful for me right now. So, my question is related to early access landing pages and the development timeline. What are the pros and cons for using early access landing pages before any development? So, the page wouldn’t have a ton of content and it’d just have an email capture form. Versus a more dense landing page with screenshots, feature lists, and sometimes even pricing details. In both cases, the customer conversations would be done. There is a problem to be solved, the product is not done yet, and the goal is to get prospects beyond the ones we are talking to during validation. Thanks a lot.” This is a good question and I’m not sure there’s a right or wrong way to do this. I’ll tell you the way I’ve always leaned, but it’s just because it’s been the easier way to do it. I have tended to attack something, a problem that is pretty well-defined and that I can just have a catchy headline that says, “I plan to fix this.” I believe the headline when we launched TinySeed, which was just a landing page and email capture was something like, “Startup funding is broken for bootstrappers,” or, “Startup funding is broken. Here’s how I intend to fix that.” And then it was pros, it was 800 words or a thousand words of talking through how venture capital doesn’t support bootstrappers, but some people want to raise a little bit of money, but they don’t want to go on the venture track. And here are thumbnails of Anner and I looking intensely at things. And I realized that’s a different example because it’s not an app, and so I wouldn’t have included screenshots or features, but I did the same thing certainly with my books. My books were usually just… Well, my first book was a headline and two sentences, that was the whole thing. And then an email capture. And it was something like finally a book written for people where venture capitalists aren’t putting a bunch of money in your bank account. And I think it didn’t say people, it said startup founders or developer founders, or something like that. Books are also different. But truthfully, The SaaS Playbook, go to Saasplaybook.com right now and look at that. That is essentially what you’re talking about, which is it’s the cover, it’s pictures of me, it’s pictures of the interior, its features and benefits of the book. That is what we did this time. I had more money, I had more budget, and I knew what was going to be in the book. The book was done by then. And so, I did pay a design firm to design that whole website. And then I’ll go back to Drip. And Drip was just a headline, three or four sentences of copy and an email capture widget. And I think that’s what we launched with. So, all I’m telling you is that’s what I’ve done and I don’t want to act like that’s right or wrong. I think it’s easier when you’re first getting started, if you are tackling a simple problem like all CRMs suck and here’s why, here’s how ours is different. Or some other simple obvious pain point that’s pretty easy to communicate in a handful of sentences. I don’t know. I like to keep it simple. I like to keep it simple as well because then people might be intrigued by it and then I can talk to them and say, “How do you think I’m going to fix CRMs? What’s broken about your CRM?” If you give them screenshots and show them how you’re doing it, you are putting your opinion on that. At this point, it’s not customer development. So, I think that’s part of the question, it’s like the more vague you are, the more customer development you can do. If you are actually trying to pre-sell a bit more information is probably warranted. So, in all honesty, I could go either way. I think the danger of having screenshots and a lot of info is that means you are taking an opinion and is it a hypothesis that you are certain of? Because if you’re not, then I would tend to hold that information back and let people confirm or deny my hypothesis, confirm or deny my opinions before I become that opinionated about them. You don’t want to be certain of stuff that customers aren’t telling you that you’re just making up in your own head. But the more certain I am of it, I probably would start building out a landing page. You’re going to eventually need that full featured SaaS website. I say need. A 100% need it, but it’s a good thing to have. And I think as you’re developing the product and you become more confident in it, fleshing out that landing page to see if it’s resonating with people and to see if you’re marketing it well, I don’t think that’s a bad idea. So, thanks for your question, Pedro. Hope that was helpful. My next question is from EJ. EJ writes, “Dear, Rob. Hope this message finds you well. I’ve been following your entrepreneurial journey with great interest and your story about purchasing a Microsoft business has particularly piqued my curiosity.” I think he’s referring to HitTail, although I purchased several small products, but HitTail is the one I tend to talk about the most. And when I acquired it, I believe it was doing about 1,500 MRR and it was completely flat and had been for a long time. And I eventually grew it up to about 30K MRR At its peak. It was a high churn business, so it was in the 25 to 30K for, I don’t know, quite a long time until I wound up selling it. Back to his email. “I understand that platforms like MicroAcquire exist to facilitate these acquisitions, yet I find myself grappling with several questions about the entire process. My primary concern lies in assessing the value and potential of a Microsoft business accurately. In a marketplace where information asymmetry is prevalent, how does one ensure that they’re making an informed and fair purchase rather than falling prey to an overpriced or underperforming business? In your experience, what are the key indicators to look out for or the red flags to avoid during the evaluation process?” So, there’s more questions, but I’ll answer that. The answer is you don’t and you just have to get good at trying to identify red flags. In addition, these days, personally, I would buy through a broker, Quiet Light, Effy International, Empire Flippers. They tend to do, I think, a bit more vetting than MicroAcquire. I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy on MicroAcquire, which is now called Acquire.com by the way. This email is that old. It was before the rebrand. But yeah, there’s definitely going to be some risk. If there wasn’t risk, then it would be priced accordingly. I was buying stuff and getting a little bit scammed or lied to back in the 2005 to 2012, 2011 maybe. Was that when I made my last acquisition? Something like that. And sometimes I got lied to and sometimes I didn’t, and I just made sure that I paid a low enough purchase price that it really didn’t come back to bite me. And I also did a ton of due diligence and as much investigation of it as possible. Of course, it’s asymmetric information and I think it’s trying to learn the ropes of what do I really need to look for? The key indicators to look out for are red flags to avoid, there’s almost too many to list. I mean, I would look for a book, or an ebook, or an entire YouTube channel, or someone who is the Rob Walling of acquiring businesses. Is there a podcast or some resource? Because I could imagine writing an entire book on this process of buying micro businesses through either the brokers I’ve named or Acquire.com, or I used to… What was the other one? Flippa, Flippa.com. I don’t hear about them as much anymore, but that’s the thing. It is getting more experienced at it so you can gut feel. You start to read a business and you do see that, oh, this is why that one’s a piece of crap and hasn’t sold. The other thing is you’re talking about assessing the value and the potential of a SaaS business. Usually for me, the potential was how am I going to market this? The potential is that there’s a marketing channel that I see or an avenue I see that the current person is not exploring that I think will work, and that I have some confidence that I can learn, or that I know how to do right. And without the ability to grow it, I never bought a business. I always bought ones that I wanted to either take from flat line to going up or I wanted to accelerate their growth. The next part of his email says, “Furthermore, once the business has been acquired, the transition phase presents a new set of challenges. How does it want to effectively manage and grow a live product, especially when they’re still in the learning curve phase? Are there specific strategies or resources you found particularly helpful? During this stage?” No resources, but the strategies are you get in and you spend a ton of time learning the code base, learning what the existing marketing is, learning where the traffic is coming from, who’s converting and why, looking at the funnels, looking at the bottlenecks. I remember having the instrument several products because there was no… There may be was Google Analytics, but nothing else. So, you just had no funnel measurement. And so, I would see people drop off at this one signup forum that was 10 questions long instead of just asking for a username and a password. And I would see that the pricing was way off. So, no resources. I don’t know anybody who talks about this. Maybe someone can write in with suggestions. But the strategies are I would get in and learn the business and literally take ownership of it. Imagine coming into a new company and there is either a product or something else that you have to get in and start driving. And you don’t own it. Let’s say you’re the software development manager and you have to learn the code base. How do you dig into that? You start by one bite at a time, eating that elephant. And so, for me, I would tend to identify what are the things that need to be fixed first and then move through that list. And so, with HitTail specifically, it was unstable. It was buggy and the server was crashing. So, I was like A, I need to learn the code base enough to fix the bugs. And that took a lot of time. It did. It took dozens and dozens of hours digging in just to figure out how this thing worked. I actually did the same thing in DotNetInvoice. There were math errors in this invoicing software. And it’s kind of like you have one job and you can’t have math errors in your invoices, and yet there were. And so, it was going page by page through it and being able to figure out, fix the bug, ship new versions. And then, let’s see, with HitTail it was getting it on stable servers, so we did a migration. And then I wanted a redesign of the marketing website and of the app, and that took a couple months with a designer, and then I had to retrofit it onto this old code base, and then it was marketing. And that’s when I said, okay, now I’m going to juice up. I didn’t want to juice up SEO and ads, and whatever, content marketing, and integration marketing, and anything else until I felt like the product was stable and the design was amazing. And that one worked out. It’s not to say that that’s the plan for everything. DotNetInvoice had some bugs that I had to fix. That was different. That wasn’t SaaS. It was downloadable software that you ran on a web server. The product looked good for the time and it needed some bug fixes and better support, and then it was just marketing. And I was looking at all the avenues that I could to lmarket.net invoice and grew that from, it was doing a few hundred dollars a month, like three, probably two to $400 a month when I acquired it. And it was usually between about three and $5,000 a month by the time I was able to plateau it. I never got a pass there. But that was a great little side income while I was doing consulting and sometimes had a full-time job as well. So, yeah, you just have to dig in and do the work, honestly. I don’t know any other way. Maybe someone out there is smarter than I’m, and they can do it without digging in and doing the work, but that’s just what I did every time. But one thing I did like about it is once I spent money on it, my back was to the wall and that was a helpful motivator to me of like, well, I spent the money. Now I need to figure out how to make this work. And that is also why I bought in spaces that I had a little bit of familiarity with. Like HitTail was an SEO keyword tool. I knew SEO. And DotNetInvoice was invoicing software for .net developers. You got the source code. And so, if you didn’t, you either cared about privacy or you cared about having the source code. And so, I was able to talk with the developers and people who were buying it. And learn from them, and converse with them, and figure out how to grow the marketing funnel. And then the last question in the email says, “Lastly, I can’t help but consider the intentions of the current business owners. While I understand that there could be numerous legitimate reasons for selling, I also wonder if there might be instances where the business might have undisclosed issues or skeletons in the closet that the seller is keen to avoid. In your experience, how prevalent is a scenario? And what precautions can one take to safeguard against situations? I understand these are complex questions. Any insights you can provide would be immensely valuable.” Yeah, I’m sure there are undisclosed issues or skeletons in the closet, especially if you buy on a marketplace. I’m not saying marketplace buying is bad, but it is, I think, more risky than going through a broker. I’m not saying that brokers validate and verify everything, but there is at least some recourse with a third party involved. So, if something was undisclosed, I would at least know that I could go back to someone and this brokerage has a reputation to uphold. And so, even if the seller disappears, I have some recourse. Yeah, the idea here is probably the same answer that I said to the first question, which is you have to know what you’re doing. You have to know what you’re looking for. And that takes time and experience, which is tough because how do you get that time and experience? The time is looking through a lot of deals and learning what makes them good and bad deals. And the experience for me came from buying smaller. Well, my advice would be to buy smaller ones today and then you’ll learn what didn’t work and apply that to the next one. I actually started with an $11,000 acquisition, and that was in, I think it was ’06, 05, or ’06 when I made that. That was a lot of money. That was all the money I had in the business bank account. So, I should have done something smaller. I was building things on the side, so I did have some experience. But that’s how you want to do it. You want to take these small steps and really learn from others. And that’s where I think the information put out by these brokers by Empire Flippers, maybe Acquire.com puts out info. I don’t read their stuff. I imagine they have eBooks on the topics. And Quiet Light, and FE International, and anybody else you can get your hands on, information in that space that’s going to help you learn, is something that I would be consuming if I was actively thinking about this.  But yeah, it’s risky. There’s always a chance someone’s not going to disclose things and they’re going to screw you. You’ll never get to a 100%. It’s always scary. What I don’t know is do you get to 80% where you’re 80% certain you’ll be fine? 85%? I don’t know what that number is. But the only way that I know to get better at any of these things you’ve asked about is to put in the time and gain some experience. And without that, I think you’ll just be sitting on the sidelines. So, thanks for that question, EJ. I hope it was helpful. My last question for today is from Misha and they ask, “What are your thoughts on choosing tech to build a startup in the MicroConf Slack community, which is Microconfconnect.com? I keep seeing the same two to three questions asked in various channels. For example, my database is slow. The usual, very specific responses pile up, but the core of the question ends up being someone who is new to software development and is seeing a symptom. Often the tech stack is Node.js or some Python weirdness, not Django or some .net thing, et cetera. At this point, why are people not just using Rails or Django? Tons of educational material, plethora of people to hire and more being trained in bootcamps. A library for 99.99% of problems, one would face easiest way to deploy and scale, and most importantly, super stable frameworks. Is this just a matter of helping folks understand the technical and business challenges with making the right choice for what they are building?” This is a interesting question. I guess it’s like A, you can have database slowdowns with any tech that you use. If you’re scaling, if you have bad code, I wouldn’t always blame that on the technology. I will agree with you though that if I were to build a SaaS app, which I’m never going to do again, very likely be something like Rails or Django, maybe Laravel. These are probably the top three that I see. Node.js is fine, and I know there’s developers out there screaming at the speaker right now. But I really like these super stable server side frameworks. I don’t like JavaScript, NBC frameworks that… Like React and such that have a bunch of spinners. I know there’s unit tests and all this, but it seems like a lot of the problems that I hear about with bootstrap founders who hire developers to build things wind up in this front end. Maybe that’s what Misha is saying is, it’s not the technology necessarily, but there are certain technologies that maybe lend themselves to, well, just different types of issues. Whether it’s performance issues, or whether it’s writing spaghetti code, or whether it’s… Since there’s so many bootcamps putting out people who are less experienced, then that means maybe the code quality overall is lower. I don’t know what it is, honestly. But I really like HTML rendered to a browser and then some JavaScript sprinkled in. And I know it to say, “Hey, here’s a old man doing the old man thing.” But it’s like, no, there’s just some stability. That’s a personal preference. I think, Misha, your question of why wouldn’t everyone just use one of these two frameworks? It’s like, well, all the frameworks… These two frameworks don’t cover everything. I know they’re stable, but what if I know PHP? What if I’m a .net developer and I want to build something nights and weekends? That’s all I know. I can spend the time to try to learn a new language. I’m not going to be that great at it. Or I can use what I know and I can build quickly. That’s usually I think what’s happening. But that’s also another thing, and it’s non-technical founders starting a SaaS. It’s just hard. I’ve talked about this on this show many times where if I was a non-technical founder trying to start a SaaS, I either wouldn’t or I would try to find a co-founder. A technical co-founder who can head up and own the code. When I say wouldn’t, I mean I would go back and try to stair step my way up, certainly not by building SaaS, probably not by building software. Because thinking that you can just hire a developer to write code and build a product, is like thinking, I can hire a carpenter to come build a house. You can, but you also need an architect, and you need a designer, and you need other skill sets. And how do you know the architect is any good? And once the foundation is poured, it gets really hard to come back and undo that work. And the analogy is not perfect. I get it. But thinking that any developer can build a SaaS app is incorrect. In fact, the vast majority cannot. And yet, people hire dev shops that just don’t… They don’t build quality code. They cut corners because you are not going to know any different. That’s the problem, is you can’t evaluate whether the developer is good or not, and you can’t evaluate if they’re rushing. Because even good developers can ship crappy code, low quality code if they’re in a big hurry and they’re being pushed to hit deadlines. There’s a reason that the majority of the MicroConf community are technical. It’s not that we don’t want technical people. In fact, we want more non-technical people because, hey, we need more marketers here. How often have I heard of a developer founder who needs more marketers? So, I’d love to have more marketers in the MicroConf community. Same thing with TinySeed though. Last time I looked, I think it’s like 10 or maybe 15% of companies we funded with TinySeed don’t have at least one technical co-founder. It’s a super minority. And there’s a reason for that because getting to the point to where a TinySeed would fund you, it’s obviously not easy. And doing that without a developer who is heading up that side of the business makes it even harder. And in fact, probably the number one issue that tends to face companies that we funded who don’t have a developer co-founder, is they are perpetually dealing on and off, but perpetually dealing with the headaches of that with, “I had a lead dev and then they left, and now I have to replace them.” And it’s like, that’s not the best. It’s a tough situation to be in. And those folks are bearing the burden of having to be the ultimate where the buck stops for a code base, but they’re not a developer. Your tech lead leaves and now you have two juniors in a mid-level. And you now have to go find that next tech lead, but you don’t know if they’re any good. It’s an uphill battle. And as appealing as SaaS is, and the fact that it is the best business model on the planet, I believe it is just really difficult. And this is why I talk about doing the stair step method of entrepreneurship, not to go straight to SaaS. And this is why if I was a non-technical founder… I mean these days, I wouldn’t be writing the code. If I were to start a SaaS app, I would try to find the best SaaS developer I knew, whether they lived in my town or not, or I just knew them through MicroConf. And I would work my network. And maybe I would hire them, maybe they’d be a, they wouldn’t. That’s irrelevant. Probably if I wanted to keep them around for a long time, then they would get equity, because I would want us to have that shared motivation, because it’s hard in the early days. But I wouldn’t go hire a freelancer, or a contractor, or an agency, or I’ll say just a… Random is not the right word, but you get the picture of AW2 employee who can leave any time and leave this code base. It’s like leaving an open heart surgery patient in the middle of surgery. And SaaS apps unfortunately, you’re always performing open heart surgery on a living patient. And that’s one of the reasons why this is so challenging. So, Misha, I’m not sure I have the best answer of why everyone doesn’t just use Rails or Django, but I sure appreciate your question. And I do agree with you that I think there are some tech stacks that are better designed or better suited for building SaaS applications. So, thanks for writing in. And that wraps another episode of Startups For The Rest Of Us. Thanks for joining me today and every week.

It’s great to have you here this week. I’m your host, Rob Walling. This week I talk with Jordan Hansen, founder of Cobalt Intelligence, about his really interesting journey of becoming an accidental SaaS entrepreneur. Cobalt Intelligence is a SaaS that allows you to do business verification with Secretary of State data, using an API. And in the conversation you’re going to hear how Jordan just got there, almost by accident, that he really didn’t want to launch a SaaS. But he wound up building what is a pretty incredible business and has actually taken funding from TinySeed. You’ll hear us discuss that in the episode. I want to address that upfront, actually. I hope that, given this podcast has been going for 700-something episodes, I hope that you know that I don’t use this podcast as a commercial for TinySeed, nor for MicroConf. Obviously, I am motivated to promote things that I’m working on. If I’m running an event, I want you to show up. If I’m running an accelerator, and you want funding, I would love for you to apply. But the reason I bring folks like Jordan on and Matt Wensing, Derek Grimmer, Ruben Gomez, and other TinySeed founders I’ve brought on the show in the past several years is because their stories are interesting. They’re knowledgeable. They know how to communicate what made them successful. They’re willing to talk about both failures and successes. They tell their story well. There’s so much to it, and if a company or a founder has all that and can bring the thunder to this podcast, that I think can help keep you motivated or give you some strategies and tactics to succeed, I’m not going to exclude them from that because they happen to be part of MicroConf, or they happen to be part of TinySeed. Before we dive into that, tickets for MicroConf US in Atlanta next April 2024 are on sale. This event will sell out. If you’re thinking about coming to Atlanta, April 21st through the 23rd to see me co-host this event with Lianna Patch, and to see speakers like myself, Rand Fishkin, and several others, head to MicroConf.com/US to grab your ticket before they sell out. We had an amazing event just a few months ago in Denver, and I expect the event in Atlanta to be no different. So MicroConf.com/US to grab your ticket today. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Jordan. Jordan, welcome to the show.  Jordan Hansen:Hey, thanks, Rob. It’s good to be here.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s great to have you. So Cobalt Intelligence, your H1 is “Keep up with your pipeline. Automate and integrate SOS, court, and other public data into your MCA underwriting process” – wow – “so you can move forward quickly and confidently.” I-  Jordan Hansen:Does that feel long?  Rob Walling:Well, no. I don’t know what SOS and MCA is. So it’s like you have these obviously industry-specific terms in your H2, your subtitle in essence. So either that’s a really good decision because you’re speaking exactly to your customer, or you’re alienating people. But that’s for you to let us know. Translate that for us.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. The good thing is I can answer this with confidence because I hired Lianna Patch, and we worked together. She crafted these headlines exactly like this. Whether it’s the right decision or not-  Rob Walling:I’d feel pretty confident-  Jordan Hansen:I [inaudible 00:04:36] to Lianna.  Rob Walling:At that point.  Jordan Hansen:Exactly.  Rob Walling:Translate for me what I just said then, because there’s a bunch of entrepreneurs listening to this right now, who are like, “I am not sure what this product is”. It’s CobaltIntelligence.com, if folks want to check it out.  Jordan Hansen:What we do is we help people in the finance industry. I say banks, but most of the time it’s people doing alternative lending. They’re not banks because they don’t have the volume we look for. But when a bank or a business needs capital for a pizza restaurant, and their oven goes down, they need money to replace that oven immediately. If they go to a bank SBA loan, it’s going to be a long time to be able to get that cash. They’re going to go work with an alternative funder, which normally can get them that cash, working capital, something like that, a lot quicker. They have to do the underwriting on this business so they check things like the SOS, which is what we call, it’s the Secretary of State. When you start a business, you register your business. We’re going to do things that check. “Okay, is this business in good standing? When did it file? How old is it? How much history it has?” And then court judgments. Has there been a bad history of credit? That kind of thing, that’s where we’re going to help with these funders. Right now, they’re doing that manually, and we help them just automate that process.  Rob Walling:So manually, meaning I am a business in Maine, applied to get a loan from us, or 500 businesses in Maine applied today to get a loan. There’s a lot of volume, you were telling me about.  Jordan Hansen:A lot of volume.  Rob Walling:I’m going to go to the Maine Secretary of State website, which I know is one of your favorites, and I’m going to log in. I’m going to type in, oh, this business name. Do they exist? And are they in good standing? And do they have a tax bill? That kind of stuff. And you’re saying you have that data for all 50 states, that they can just plug into via – I know there’s a web interface – but it’s mostly an API. Is that right?  Jordan Hansen:That’s right.  Rob Walling:Your product is mostly an API, yeah.  Jordan Hansen:It’s an API. The fact that it’s public data, a portal doesn’t offer a whole lot to them because if they have to go to my portal, then they may as well just go to the state. Again, that’s why banks aren’t great. I remember just talking to a bank last week and they said, “A thousand a year, we could probably do that.” I’m like, “No, our plans start at a thousand look-ups a month.” And they’re like, “Oh, that’s a volume. We need higher volume.” They’re processing hundreds of applications a day.  Rob Walling:Okay. I want to get into a little later, because you’re a developer, and you built this yourself. I want to talk a little bit about how you get all that data, because I’m sure people are wondering, “Is this freely available? Is just JSON blobs that are on GitHub that you’re downloading?” But before we do that, talk about where the company is. As I often tell people, you can give revenue, you can give team size, just whatever you feel comfortable with to give the listeners an idea what stage you’re at.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. Right now we are three or a team of three, and we are profitable, so we feel pretty good. Two of those are US-based, both engineers as myself, engineer-founder, and then another engineer to give an idea of how much salary that is. We have one offshore marketing person. And we’re doing, thankful, thankfully, we’re profitable as of it’s been about, I guess, the last 10, 12 months we’ve been profitable.  Rob Walling:What’s your main channel for finding new customers? Seems like a pretty specialized market.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah, it’s interesting because I didn’t know this market existed before. I started building, I was building things constantly, and I just was building them in public, blogging about it, and then making YouTube content is where it started. And then people started reaching out and say, “Hey, I could use this data in my business.” That’s really what we’ve kept it doing. We just continuously are making YouTube content. It’s shifted how we focus that, but it’s still our main bread and butter is content, whether it be blog content or YouTube.  Rob Walling:Yeah. That actually takes us back to your origin story, is that you had a good job with golden handcuffs, working at Lenovo. Were you a developer, a senior engineer there?  Jordan Hansen:I was, yep.  Rob Walling:Yeah. You didn’t want to do a SaaS because you knew SaaS was a drag?  Jordan Hansen:It sucked. Oh my gosh, it was terrible.  Rob Walling:Because you built one within Lenovo, and it was just a fiasco. Is that what happened?  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. It was fine. No, the product was good. We had built a good product. That’s why they hired me in fact. They didn’t have any, they only had on-prem software they were selling. They wanted to build us a cloud-based software. I had done that before. They hired me to focus on that, and they built the whole team around us to build this software. But it was a good product. We did a good job. But it was so hard. They’re Lenovo, so they had a lot more security restrictions, a lot more red tape that we had to get through. But I was like, “I’m never building a SaaS, never.”  Rob Walling:That’s why I say stair step. For folks who haven’t built one, they just don’t know how hard it is that first time. And being at a big company doesn’t make it any easier because you have, like you said, all the security, there’s just so much more. Paul Graham had this expression when they got acquired by Yahoo, and he said, “We got in there.” I don’t know, they’re 20-somethings at the time. This is in ’90s. He said, “Once we started working at a bigger company, it felt like running through water.” Have you ever tried to run in the ocean?  Jordan Hansen:It’s so hard. Oh, yeah.  Rob Walling:I can’t get anything done. What would take a week at a startup will take two months at a big company, and it’s infuriating. I’m not saying Lenovo is good or bad. I’ve just worked there.  Jordan Hansen:That was a good team. Honestly, we were probably almost like a little company within the bigger company, so I feel like I loved it. They were good people and a really good team. And we made a lot of really awesome stuff. But it still was, like you said, there was still a lot of, we had to go security checks all the time.  Rob Walling:It’s challenging, yeah, yeah.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah, it was hard.  Rob Walling:So you’re working the day job at Lenovo. Am I right that you were creating blog and YouTube content around web scraping just as a hobby?  Jordan Hansen:Yeah, I needed something. I remember listening to a book by John Sonmez. I don’t know if you’ve heard of him.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Jordan Hansen:Anyway, he has this book, Soft Skills for Software Engineers, and he said, “You should write a blog.” And I was like, “Everyone says to write a blog.” But I was determined. I really wanted my own business. I had one in college, and I was like, “I know that’s where I want to be eventually.” But I didn’t want it to be just a dream. “I got to take some action.” So I just started writing a blog post a week about web scraping, about getting data publicly. And the blogs, they sucked at the beginning, and they probably sucked a lot during the way too. But it forced me to find the cool stuff. I had to like, “Okay, what am I going to write this week? Let’s find something I can web scrape.” And that really is how it started.  Rob Walling:Why web scraping? Is that something you had done at a job, or you just decided to do it?  Jordan Hansen:I had a friend that hired me to do a contract job for his business, and it was around web scraping. I thought it was fun and interesting, and I was trying to pick something that wasn’t, a little more on the fringe. It wasn’t something that everyone was doing. I felt maybe intimidated to do just software because there’s really good software engineers. I’m pretty good, but I don’t know if I’m the best. But I felt like this was something a little more, that not every single software engineer could say they were good at.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that, picking a specialty, a niche from the start. So you’re blogging, and were you doing YouTube?  Jordan Hansen:Not for a while. I did probably blogging for a year, every week for probably a year plus. And then I switched over to YouTube as well. I just started… Honestly, my YouTube videos at the beginning, we were just down doing that Tennessee retreat, and we had breakout mastermind groups, and people talked about some wins you had. And I just harped. YouTube is so, so good. My videos at the beginning, it literally was an hour and a half of me writing code. That was it. Now, I wasn’t entertaining, definitely not, and I probably had 30 to 50 views on it. But I just kept making them. Because I was building stuff every day, I’d wake up early in the morning, it was like 5:00 A.M. or 6:00 A.M. I’d record before my day job and just code whatever stuff and put it all, just throw it up on YouTube, no editing at all. The thing is, it just builds. People started following more and more. And then I get people reaching out, like, “Hey, I need this data”, or “I need different things”. Why not do it?  Rob Walling:That’s interesting. How much… Just hearing you say, “I shipped a blog post every week for a year”, that’s something most people won’t do. 52 blog posts is nothing. That’s nothing easy. And then to create videos, you’re like, “Oh, I was just recording.” You kind of matter-of-fact it when you say it, but it’s a lot of work. You weren’t making money off it. You didn’t have a huge audience, not like you had tens of thousands of people. You probably had hundreds, I’m guessing, reading and following. So it’s not that much. Why did you keep doing it for that long? What was the internal motivation that kept you going?  Jordan Hansen:That’s a good question. I really think it was because I was that determined to find… I wanted a side business. I wanted a business. I wanted my own… I wanted to be a Rob Walling one day. I didn’t know who you were at that time, but sorry, don’t be offended. But no, I wanted to have my own business, and I felt like I love the people I worked with, but I wanted to be my own boss. I did not like being told what to do. Lenovo was probably as good as it could have gotten for a software job, but I wanted that, to have built my own thing.  Rob Walling:You have the genetic flaw we call entrepreneurship.  Jordan Hansen:That’s right.  Rob Walling:I often call it unemployable.  Jordan Hansen:That’s right.  Rob Walling:I remember becoming unemployable. I still had to work for a few years after that. But the moment where I was like, “Oh, I’m never doing this again. The moment that I can quit this job, I’m done, and I’m never going back.” Okay, so you’re doing it nights and weekends. You’re shipping these videos. So how does that turn into launching a SaaS that you said you didn’t ever want to do?  Jordan Hansen:Again, I was there at Lenovo, and I had a plan. I was like, “I’m going to get to a point eventually where I can quit.” I started saving my money more. As the videos came out, I would start to get some people doing one-off contract work. They’re like, “Okay, can I get this done? Can I get this done?” And I occasionally signed people up for recurring… They had me on retainer, essentially, to collect data for them. So I had some income coming in. I was making some money there, and I was selling occasional things. I would get some sponsored videos and posts too occasionally. So I probably had, I don’t know, 10 grand to 20 grand a year on the side that was coming. Not a lot, but I kept saving the money, and I was like, “Okay, with the goal to quit.” That’s kind of how it took me. Now, I didn’t get to the SaaS part. Even when I quit my job at Lenovo, I was like, “Okay.” I told my wife, “Hey, we have enough money in the bank that we should be good to live how we are for two years, I think, with the revenue we have coming.” And so she’s like, “Yeah, totally, let’s do it.” I quit. Again, no intention of doing SaaS. I was just going to do contract work, build something. But recurring revenue was really, I wanted that. I had done things before where I had sold a one-off, and I hated it, just because people came back to you, especially when it’s software, they want tweaks. I hate getting in that pricing discussion. I just wanted recurring revenue is really what I wanted.  Rob Walling:Was that 2021?  Jordan Hansen:That was 2021.  Rob Walling:This was going on, yeah. You took the leap with two years of savings in the bank. Congratulations. I know a handful of entrepreneurs that have done that. I was never able to do it, just to pull together that much cash to be able to do it. I would be super… For me, watching my savings burn down would be pretty tough. How did that feel? I’m sure the first day you quit, and you show up for your new job, which is working for yourself, got to feel amazing.  Jordan Hansen:It was amazing, right. Oh, so good. It was the best feeling ever.  Rob Walling:And did you, over the course of the next weeks or month, did you start to feel a little bit like, “Oh man, I got to make this work fast because I’m going to be losing tens of thousands of dollars over six months,” or whatever.  Jordan Hansen:There was stress. I don’t think it was intense stress. I had enough. Again, when I quit, it was a mix of savings, plus I had money coming in. I was like, “Oh, I’ll just keep having to build these customers, and I’ll have enough to take it over”, whatever it is. The problem was I was building products, but they weren’t really software products. It was more like a weird mix of, “Hey, I’ll send you an email a day with data.” It’s probably a SaaS kind of. I didn’t have any login. I’m just going to send you a CSV and invoice you once a month, and you’ll just pay me. That’s what I wanted to build. I was like, “No login, no SaaS, and we’ll just go from there.”  Rob Walling:You applied to TinySeed, and you were pretty early. I’m not sure I remember. I saw you sent me some notes, and I didn’t remember you being as early as you were, but…  Jordan Hansen:I don’t know. Maybe you read it wrong, and that’s what got me in because I felt pretty lucky.  Rob Walling:Did you apply in ’21 or ’22?  Jordan Hansen:I applied in ’22. In fact, I didn’t even know what TinySeed was in ’21, didn’t know what you were in ’21 until the very end.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Tell us how you got there then.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. I started actually building a software business. It was just these products that I was building. As I got to more of this public data, I was just building up connections, and I was like, “You know what? This would be kind of cool to use and sell.” And then I had some people reach out and say they wanted it. That’s what exposed me to it. “So, okay, I think this is something where I could actually charge as a software as a SaaS or a software as a service business.” I started looking around for podcasts. I’m a big consumer of podcasts, and someone recommended yours. They were like, “Hey, this is one of the top ones you should listen to. I started listening to it like crazy. That’s where I got exposed to TinySeed, and it drew… I’m married with three kids. I’m 39 now, so when I quit, I was mid-thirties. I wasn’t going to be someone that’s going to go venture and work 80-hour weeks. I’m never going to do that. It was really a decision of… Funding was never on my radar, didn’t want it. But what you kept talking about, this lifestyle, you were saying, the type of business you were building, what TinySeed showed, promised that really appealed to me. I was like, “Maybe.” But I felt very imposter. Again, I didn’t want to be in the software business. I wasn’t someone who had been doing software since college. It was a whim. It was 2022, spring of 2022. I think you probably had said, “Hey, the application’s a piece of cake. Check it out.” And it was a piece of cake. You or Tracy, I don’t know who built that. I think Tracy built the application.  Rob Walling:Tracy did.  Jordan Hansen:It was so easy. I went and looked at it, and I was like, “Really? I can answer these questions.” I had to look up, I think, some of the definitions because I was like, “I don’t know what these software terms are.”  Rob Walling:Right, right. See, that’s something that I want folks to keep in mind. If you’re listening to this, and you feel like an imposter, but you have a business that’s doing revenue, and you’re like, “Oh, I should never apply to TinySeed because I don’t qualify”, or whatever. That’s not usually true. I also want to call out, this podcast and my interviews are not advertisements for TinySeed. You just as well could have gotten involved with the MicroConf ecosystem, never applied to TinySeed. And that’s okay too. The reason we have all this stuff, we have mastermind matching for people who want to pay for that. We have TinySeed funding and the accelerator for folks who want to participate in that. We have the state of independent SaaS for people who want to… We have in-person events. Some people want to go, some people don’t. I don’t have an agenda with… You’re not on here because you got into TinySeed. You’re on here because you have an interesting story to tell, and I think it can inspire people who may not want to build a SaaS, and you did, or may have a SaaS, but think they’re an imposter, which you did as well. You know what I mean? Now you’re much further than that down the road, with full-time employees and profitable and growing and all that. That’s the point of the conversation is to inspire folks to follow the path that you followed. You must’ve been surprised then. Do you remember what your revenue was?  Jordan Hansen:Yes. I had been selling, like I said, I had been selling other products. I had some recurring revenue, but it wasn’t the SaaS revenue. I had about $4,000 a month in that, which felt okay. But I felt like it was cheating to almost list it. I had to put a disclaimer because I only had $300 of actually the SaaS revenue. Had just launched it, very pre-beta, so barely anything was coming in there.  Rob Walling:We funded a few companies like this, where there’s a mix of revenue. But if it’s recurring, if the 4,000 was one-time, or it was truly consulting revenue for dollars for hours writing code, we would’ve said, “Get the SaaS further along. Please reapply.” But I remember there being… It was like, “Well, it’s recurring revenue, and it’s heavily related. It gets you to Ramen profitability, close to default alive.” We’ve invested in a handful of businesses like that, where it’s like, “Ooh.” Actually, we really like APIs anyways, just as a business model. We’ve had some pretty big successes within TinySeed. So we like them anyways. We like you, we like developer-founders, which you are. And we liked that you had traction in this space, where we’re like, “This is a niche of a niche. We don’t have any other A, no other TinySeed companies in it, but you can dominate.” I really like vertical software. We do at TinySeed because you can dominate it. You’re not competing with whoever – Microsoft, Google, Facebook. You don’t have to be the best marketer. You just have to be better than the other five in your niche. Obviously, you are. I want to give folks context, who think, “$300 MRR? How did he get in?” There’s more to it than that. You had more than 4,000 in revenue. It happened to not all be from the SaaS, but there’s nuance. This is when people say, “Should I apply to TinySeed?” And it’s oftentimes, if you’re in doubt, do it. And we’ll just talk. We’ll talk it out. I want to figure out here more about what the revenue’s from and just more about how the business breaks down. Now, as I said, I don’t want to make this a commercial for TinySeed. But I know you’ve gotten so much out of TinySeed, and I want to give you the opportunity to say that because it seems like you were… I don’t know if you were surprised by that, or maybe you’re surprised by how much you’ve gotten out of it. Just talk us through it.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. I want to say Rob didn’t pay me. He didn’t ask me to come on and talk about TinySeed. If you’re listening to this podcast, you probably know not the hard salesman of this. He’s very low-key, and that’s how this was. But before this, I was a solo founder, feeling like an imposter, did not have a history of… I was a corporate job guy. There’s entrepreneur guys that I feel like they’ve been in software forever doing these things, and they were really comfortable with his ecosystem. I was not. Whenever I was having a decision to make, I was questioning it, even should I even stick with this product? That was a big decision I had all the time. And it was constant. I was asking my wife, but she didn’t know either. So I had no one I felt like I could trust to talk to about it. And I wanted a co-founder, but I had had co-founders in the past, and so I did not want a co-founder. I wanted the dream co-founder that would work. So applying to TinySeed, the money was good, but I needed someone to talk to. I wanted a community to talk to and say, “Hey, is this crazy? Is this not?” Honestly, it’s probably been a big… Getting into TinySeed was A, validation of my idea, that, hey, this actually is something I could focus on. I thought this, gone back and thought about this a lot. I don’t know if I would’ve focused on it. I probably would’ve chased another shiny thing. “Oh, someone else asked me about this, so I’m going to try to build that now.” The fact that I could now focus on it, which I feel like most businesses, when you focus on one thing, that’s where the growth happens. You just have to keep going. It’s going to suck for a while, and it’s going to continue sucking, probably for a long time. But keeping with it really just, that’s where the dividends come.  Rob Walling:It sounds like it made a big difference. And it’s not, as you said, the money’s the money. It’s fine. The community, the mastermind we match you in, the other folks that you can hit me up… You and I just had a call about your strategy for the next six months right before recording this podcast episode. You can just hit me up, get on my calendar at any time.  Jordan Hansen:Huge difference, yeah.  Rob Walling:And there’s 250 founders in TinySeed. We have 40 or 50 mentors, and you can hit them up. That’s really the value, I think, of… And to be honest, as an entrepreneur myself, I’m still a startup founder. TinySeed and MicroConf are startups. We have found product-market fit, but we have to worry about pricing. We have to worry about moats and this and that. That’s one of our moats. Anybody can raise money and hand out checks. Who can build a community like TinySeed? Not that many. And who has the alumni network? And who has the mentor network of the B2B SaaS founder  Jordan Hansen:It’s a special thing. It really is. They’re some of my best friends now, fellow TinySeed founders. When I go to the events, it’s a blast. You hang out with them. We just had the first one where we could bring some family, and my wife came. And she’s not really the most social person sometimes, but she was loving it. She was like, “Oh, these people are amazing.” I’m like, “Yeah, this is what I talking to you about. This is why I come home, and I’m like, ‘Hey, that’s my best friend, Jason. Hey, that’s my best friend, John. These are my guys I hang out with all the time.'”  Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

In true Startups For the Rest of Us fashion, I have a question for you. When did you know you had product-market fit?  Jordan Hansen:Product-market fit, that’s a tough one. You hear people, I heard your podcast with Noah Kagan. I don’t know, this came out just before we were, the last one I listened to anyway. And he’s like, “You’re going to know.” I guess I kind of know. People are paying me, and I’m living. I feel very lucky for where I am. But man, I’m just constantly faced with doubt. What else can I do? Am I there enough? I don’t feel like we’re exploding yet, but since we joined TinySeed, we’ve probably been four to six, so a lot of growth since we’ve joined, which has been amazing. It’s easy to have those multiples when you only have $400 when you join. Doesn’t take much to multiply. But I would probably say when I knew I had product-market fit, it’s never, not yet.  Rob Walling:See, I think you’re being modest. The fact that you have people paying you thousands or tens of thousands a year means that you’ve built something that people want and are willing to pay for. Now the question is, you usually have product-market fit with your core customers who are not canceling. The question is how many of those exist in the world? And can you reach them at a scale? And what’s the switching cost? There’s all this other stuff. We might say, and as we usually say, their product-market fit is not a binary. It’s not a one or a zero. It is a continuum. Product-market fit also, per my conversation with Ruben a few weeks ago, you can have strong product-market fit with a certain group or with a certain product. And then you launch this second piece of it, and it’s like, “Oh, we don’t have it with this new customer type. There’s multiple ICPs, ideal customer profiles.” I think you have it strong with a certain group of folks, and I think you’re just in the process of figuring out can you expand that? Yeah. Or can you strengthen it with them?  Jordan Hansen:Certainly, maybe some of the things you’ve noticed is when you get on a phone call with someone, and it’s the easiest sales call of your life. They’re just like, “All right. I’m ready. Let’s go.”  Rob Walling:Oh, yeah. Yeah, that’s what it is.  Jordan Hansen:Then you know okay, okay, there’s something here. I don’t have to convince these people, I don’t have to sell the vision. They get it. They’re already looking for it. When that happens, that’s probably what it feels like.  Rob Walling:I teased it earlier, about you have all this data, you have an API. Where does this data come from that you have in your database that you’re basically selling access to?  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. Like I said, it’s mostly public information. Pretty much all of it is public information. Our customers, they do buy data from places that aren’t public, but I worry… You worry about credibility of that data. Anything we get, it’s something that we have some kind of integration with a state. A lot of times we even purchase the data from the state. Sometimes we just have integrations built into those states. But it’s all public data in fact. And we also have where we do Freedom of Information Requests, where we’ll just ask the state, they provide that data. Legally, they have to provide it. It’s public data, all this business data. That’s the data we’re providing to our customers. We’re just automating it and maintaining a large software infrastructure that goes through automating that collection and that data.  Rob Walling:I want to talk about what I think you’ve told me has probably been the hardest part of the journey, and it’s about YouTube because you had traction. You were publishing videos. You still have traction, but that was a nice source of customers. And then someday, somebody comes a-knocking. Walk us through that story.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah, it’s a tough one. I showed you this graph early, before this conversation, and there’s a notable spike. Like I said, most of my videos before a certain time, they were not very big. Most of them were just I got a hundred views here and there. But at some point, I started gaining traction, and the video… It was earlier last year, in 2023, in the spring, it just started. I don’t know what it was. It was a video had already been out for probably a year plus. But YouTube picked it up in the algorithm, and we went from 800 subscribers to 2000 subscribers to 3000 to 8,000 subscribers within two months. Usage went up like crazy. But some of the problem that happened was the data, the stuff we were talking about, did not overlap very well with our target customers. We had to make the business decision.”Okay, this is more distracting than it is helpful.” It was so hard because you build up some ego and pride and the fact that people are reaching out to you. We were getting a lot more comments, and they were saying… It was just at the beginning of this rise where we started to take… We took all the videos down. We had 350 videos published. We took probably 300 of them and put them down. They’re private now, and I feel bad. People still comment, and they say, “Hey, can we get access to these videos?” And I say, “I had to make the business decision to take them down.” It was a source of leads too, because while most of it wasn’t overlapping, most of it was distracting. The overlap existed. We probably lost a little bit of source of leads as well. It felt good to be the man that knew stuff, that could talk about things, and just that little bit of credibility. It disappeared for a second. I remember discussing it with my wife, and I think with you too. Yeah, we did. You and I met and talked about it, to say, “Okay, I think I need to make this decision.” But I was really proud of myself that… It was a hundred percent the right decision for the business, and I’m proud of myself that I made it, even though it really ended up in being… Since then, we were 8,200 subscribers, I think, and we’ve lost subscribers. Now, we’re still making YouTube content, but it’s a little bit shifted and focused more on our customers. Now those people that subscribed originally for a different type of content, they’re churning out, which is fine. I understand. Not offended at all, but my pride takes a little hit.  Rob Walling:Sure. Because these numbers, this is the thing with vanity metrics, and I’m going to say YouTube subscribers are vanity metrics more so-  Jordan Hansen:A hundred percent.  Rob Walling:Email subscribers are not vanity metrics, unless if your open rate’s really low, whatever. Certain people beat their lists up. But email subscribers are the highest form of audience in my opinion. And podcast subscribers are actually very, very high because it’s usually, it’s podcast listens, it’s downloads. If you have 30,000, then you get 30,000 downloads, and we approximate those as listens. YouTube subscribers are like Twitter followers, where you can have 30,000 YouTube subscribers, and you publish a video, and you get what? A thousand views on it or something. That’s pretty common. Unless it catches the algorithm, it doesn’t even get shown to all your people. That’s the problem with Vanity metrics is you have these 8,000 subscribers, and that’s a number. And you’re like, “I want that to go up into the right, because we want all numbers to go up to the right.” But you realize that there’s this focus problem, there’s a mismatch. That’s something that most, especially with content, I don’t think people think about that enough. “Oh, my content is getting eyeballs, but is it achieving? What’s the end goal?” The end goal is bringing more people into the business, assuming it’s a business channel. On YouTube, it’s Cobalt Intelligence. So it is truly your business channel. It’s not like you’re building a personal brand around Jordan. You’re building it around the business. The goal really is to promote the business. Now, some could argue, “Well, look at HubSpot”, or “Look at Salesforce.” Look at these other companies. They do just put out broad, broad, broad stuff. Well, that’s because they’re public companies with a deca-billion dollar valuations.  Jordan Hansen:And they sell to a huge horizontal audience.  Rob Walling:Huge swath.  Jordan Hansen:They catch one little person over here, over there, and it could be someone valuable.  Rob Walling:Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of customers versus Cobalt, which has a fraction of that number. You don’t need that many because you charge so much more. So you know that lack of focus can actually be, it can be detrimental to the marketing, just because you have people seeing it.  Jordan Hansen:I had to make the decision because I love those subscribers. It felt good, and it was nice, the ego, the pride. Like you said, it’s a metric, it’s a vanity metric. While I did like that, I decided I liked money more. Really, that’s what it came down to. It’s like, “Hey, do I want the subscribers? Or do I want more dollars?” I like dollars more today at least. Maybe one day that changes.  Rob Walling:Jordan, as we wrap up, if you can describe your journey, because your journey feels, I guess, I say it’s unusual. But it’s probably not. It’s actually not that uncommon for folks to… It’s like accidental entrepreneurship almost. You knew you wanted to be an entrepreneur. Maybe accidental SaaS founder. Reflect on the last several years and how things have panned out for you.  Jordan Hansen:Yeah. That’s what I would hope the most. Whenever I talk to people, I just don’t think it’s as hard as people think it is. More importantly is that they take action and actually do something. So often, at least that I’ve visited in that trap, where I didn’t do anything. I just feel lucky, even meeting with other TinySeed companies. I didn’t choose this industry really. I stumbled upon it, and I’m just feel grateful that I have people that are willing pay. But not only that, the biggest way that we are increasing our revenue so quickly is the fact that we can charge a lot of money. Honestly, people are willing to pay for it. If we had a product where we could only charge $15 a month or $20 a month, revenue growth, it would just be insanely difficult. Now I can land one customer, and we add 20% to our revenue. I just feel really lucky that I happened to be in this, not only with TinySeed that’s been helpful to focus, but also just happen to have a product that’s good. And I don’t take that for granted at all. I recognize that I’m lucky to be where I am.  Rob Walling:Jordan, thanks so much for joining me on the show. If folks want to keep up with you on Twitter, you are jordbhansen with E-N at the end. And of course CobaltIntelligence.com if they want to see what you’re working on. Thanks so much, man.  Jordan Hansen:Thank you.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Jordan for coming on the show. If you’ve bought my book, the SaaS Playbook, and haven’t yet left a five-star rating on Amazon or Audible or wherever you get your books, it would mean a lot to me. If you log into the site, and click that five star, I don’t even think you have to write a review. I think you can just rate it, and it goes a long way towards helping more people discover the book. The book has crossed 20,000 copies sold, which feels amazing. As you know, my mission is to multiply the world’s population of independent, self-sustaining startups. The more folks I can get this book into the hands of, the more I can continue leaning into that mission. I hope you enjoyed this week’s show.

You’re listening to Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m your host, Rob Walling. Thank you if you responded to my tweet about episode 700. That was very meaningful. A lot of people weighed in on that thread and I just really appreciated all the well wishes and all the folks who said that this podcast has impacted you on your journey and it’s made a difference in your entrepreneurial career because that’s why I’m here, that’s why I do this every week. Today, for the first time in quite a while, I’m doing a solo listener question episode. I have some voicemails piling up. I’m going to be covering topics ranging from which episodes of this podcast are good for beginners, whether someone should focus on revenue or profit, how to compete in a competitive space and being concerned about that, as well as when do conditions warrant lowering your prices. But before we get into the episode, I want to invite you to MicroConf Remote: Early Stage SaaS Sales Strategies. It’s an online event. We’re hosting March 12th and 13th of 2024. It runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Time on those two days. And there will be sessions all focused on early stage SaaS sales led by Rachel Leow, Craig Hewitt, Daniel Hebert, Sam Howard. I’ll be emceeing. And we’re going to cover strategies to boost your close rate, build a sustainable sales process, and figure out how to overcome the challenges of selling as a technical founder. We’ll also have Daily Founder Mixer Sessions where you’ll get to meet other attendees to network and chat about what you’re working on. Tickets are inexpensive and they are available at microconfremote.com. Let’s dive into the first question of the day. As always, voicemails, audio or video, go to the top of the stack. You can always send in a question by going to startupsfortherestofus.com. Click Ask a question in the top nav.  Samuel:Hi Rob, Samuel from Sweden here. I’ve been following you the past years and you’ve inspired me to build my own products and launch some stuff. But now also I would like to introduce this thinking to some of my friends who are really skilled but not into this entrepreneurial bootstrapping thinking. So I wonder what episodes would you recommend me to introduce them with? You’ve done a lot of episodes, but maybe you have a few that could summarize it and get them going. Thanks.  Rob Walling:It’s a good question and my answer is, it depends, of course. Honestly, is a podcast the best way to introduce someone to a concept like this? I think it might be a book or a blog post for that matter. So if you want to send them a blog post, I would Google The Stair Step Method of Entrepreneurship and send them that. If you think a book would be better for them, and obviously that can be audio or PDF or Kindle or a paperback, it’s going to be up to you. Start Small, Stay Small is old and it’s a bit dated, but the philosophy is really laid out well in that book. And I’d say 75% of what’s in there still holds true today. It’s the mental side of it. It’s transitioning from developer to entrepreneur. And that book is cheap. It’s 10 bucks on Kindle. And there’s an audio version on Audible. So whatever they like to learn in, that might be the starting point. The Saas Playbook, in my opinion, is a much better book. It’s, I’m a better writer. I have more knowledge. It covers more topics. It covers topics I think are overall maybe more relevant to today’s space. And again, that’s similar, it’s 10 to $25 depending on which format folks want to dig into. Now if instead they watch a lot of YouTube, then you could go to microconf.com/YouTube and we have a playlist called Building Your First SaaS: The Ultimate Crash Course. It’s a lot of videos, but it kind of gets you in the mindset of what we do here. I personally think books are just, they’re a more compact way to do it and they’re probably a more approachable way than recommending episodes of a podcast. With that said, if I really wanted to dig in and recommend episodes of the podcast, I would go to the greatest hits tab in the top nav of Startups For the Rest of Us. There’s some interesting solo adventures in that list that I think do a decent job of communicating what we do and how we think. I know it looks like there is episode 222, this stair-step approach to launching products that’s back from 2015, so it’s almost 10 years old. But that’s certainly going to be kind of the podcast version of the blog post I recommended earlier. So thanks for that question. I hope my answer was helpful. Now for my next question about focusing on revenue versus profit.  Cat:Hi Rob. My name is Cat Wildman. I run a startup called Powered by Diversity. We’ve been running since September 2020 and I went full-time in 2022. We closed 2023 just shy of 200K pounds profit. Not profit, revenue. My question is about profit though. So in 2024 we’re targeting 500K and we’re tracking to meet that target already. Now my question is about valuations and profit. So I have been going on top line. So you know you’re ready for series A when you’re at 1 million pounds recurring revenue. We’re tracking to get that not this year but the year after. And we’ll get there. However, I had an acquisition offer in 2023 and they were valuing us on profit. My question to you is, we are growing, though we are never going to have a massive batch of cash in the bank because we’re spending it all to grow.We spend everything that comes in on achieving that top line revenue target. So what is the startup to do? Are we going to end up… Is this world of SaaS up moving away from top line valuations and into profit? Do we hit our top line valuation and then sit and become really profitable and then sell? What is going on with this profit versus top line? Because I really don’t know what to do because when you look at our P\u0026L, we’re not very profitable at all. I think our profit, our cash at the end of 2023 was like 8.5K because we spent it all in order to get to the 200K top line revenue. And it’s going to be the same in 2024. Please help me.  Rob Walling:It’s a good question, Cat. It’s something that we have touched on in the past on the show, but it’s not something that I think I’ve covered probably in a couple years now. And so here are the rules of thumb. These are just rules of thumb. There’s always exceptions to this. I am going to give an exception almost right at the start. But in general, once you get past, it used to be a million ARR, this is SaaS only. I’m not talking about building info products or courses or building a gym or a coffee shop. I’m talking about building B2B SaaS. It used to be north of a million ARR, now it’s, I’m going to say it’s closer to 1.5 million. It’s somewhere in that range. That’s when buyers will start to evaluate you based on revenue and growth are really the one and two. Actually, growth is number one and revenue is number two and churn I think is number three in terms of what they’re valuing you based on. Not everyone will do that though. And in fact, there are these micro private equity firms or value buyers that will buy you based on net profit no matter what because they know that you haven’t been going for profit and they want to push the price down as much as they can and get a deal on it. When you’re sub a million ARR, I don’t know that I’ve heard of very many. There’s exceptions, but as a rule, you’re going to be selling for a multiple of net profit. I have an exception already. We had a company we were looking to back with TinySeed, we made him an offer. He verbally accepted and then he got an acquisition offer. I’m going to make up numbers here, but say he was doing 80,000 ARR, so it’s early stage, a pretty good fit for TinySeed still. He sold for 10X that, and it was just a top line thing. And why did he sell for 10X that? Well, the multiple’s almost irrelevant at that point because that’s what he needed to give up on the business. And he got all cash. It was a good offer. So it’s not an always thing, but it’s kind of the general rule of thumb the way it works is net profit up to about a million and a half ARR. And above that, if you’re dealing with the right buyers, so it’d be strategics or the bigger private equity who are not value buyers, they’re going to look at you at a revenue multiple based on growth. And if you are looking at value buyers or you’re below a million or a million and a half ARR, then yeah, you’re going to be looking at net profit. And that’s why if I was growing a company looking to exit in the next few years, I would not be worried about profit. I would be pumping every dollar I had back into the engine to get it to grow faster and grow bigger. And even if I wasn’t looking to exit, even if I was looking to pull profits out in the long term, if you can get that in a healthy, organic, sustainable growth and you can get your company to 2, 3, 4, 5 million, you do have so much more leeway there to then pump the brakes to back off on the growth and just get a lot more cash out of the business. So thanks for that question, Cat. I hope my insights were helpful.  Speaker 4:Absolutely love your podcast. Such an eye opener to so many questions that I’ve had and continue to have as I progress down this journey. Can’t wait to attend my first MicroConf conference when you are next in Europe. I know audio recorded questions get bumped up to the top of the queue, so hopefully you’ll be able to answer this one soon. Similar to yourself back in the day, I’m currently a consultant looking to scratch my own itch and create a SaaS platform for myself and my peers. But let me be honest, I’m crapping my pants. I really work in a fast-paced world of business process automation and AI and the niche solution on delivering is even faster. I’ve built some sort of following, a few thousand people on LinkedIn through blogging and newsletters and talking to my peers in depth about their challenges and I’m developing an MVP of what I know what I think is going to solve their problem from the conversations that we’ve had. The solution logic is a little tricky for me and that’s taken quite a long time, quite a few weeks to get this MVP up and running. I’m constantly looking over my shoulder as the market seems to be progressing at the solution that I have. But I feel that this solution really hits the nail on the head to solve my problems, my client problems and my peers. But do I continue developing myself or do I find some developer resource who can help me arrive faster at a workable MVP to present to my first potential client who’s a huge corporation, 33,000 employees? So there’s someone I have contact in there that potentially could buy this solution if it works and I can demonstrate it. And also, what are your top three elements to be differentiating myself in this market full of startups and companies with lots of backing and funding?  Rob Walling:All right, so there’s a lot there. I appreciate you sending that question in. So to answer the first part, which is, “Do I bring a developer on or do I continue building it on my own?” Without more details, I just can’t tell you what to do. The way I would think about this decision though is, “Am I making enough progress on my own and do I think that the code I’m writing or whatever I’m doing to build an MVP, because an MVP does not have to involve code at all, but is the solution I’m building going to satisfy these needs in a way that I could quickly transition to a scalable solution if I needed to? Or am I writing (beep) code and it’s going to crash or not scale because I’m kind of teaching myself, I’m a hobby developer as I go?” And it just depends. Without knowing your market and your space and more information about your financial situation, if you don’t have the money, don’t bring a developer on. Just let it take longer. Teach yourself. I used to go to library and check out books on Perl and PHP and HTML because I didn’t have the money to hire someone. But if you have the money, then maybe. And at that point, then you need to look for a reputable developer because the worst thing you can do, and the thing I see non-technical founders make over and over, is hiring developers to build stuff and they don’t know how to hire developers because they’re not technical and the code is crap and then it’s not scalable anyways and they’ve spent a bunch of money. So my answer is, I don’t know. It depends on too many factors. I think this is where you have to make a hard decision with incomplete information. And if you’re making progress on your own and you’re building it, if you feel like you’re going to build something that’s going to solve their needs, then I don’t know why you wouldn’t keep doing that. So many people build nights and weekends. However, if I had a bucket of cash and you know some developers or you can find a referral to a reputable developer or an agency, is it something you should consider? Possibly. It’s really hard to know and it depends on a lot of factors. Your second question was about differentiating yourself in a competitive space. And frankly, as a startup, you don’t want to punch pound for pound at big competitors. What are their biggest weaknesses? Their biggest weaknesses are they don’t listen to customers if they don’t move fast enough. Usually, they don’t have the best developers, designers because they don’t want to work there. So their software is usually pretty crappy, there’s a lot of politics. And usually, their customers don’t like their software, don’t like how much they charge, don’t like how they sell, don’t like that they get locked into these contracts. There’s all this stuff that big companies do that you need to figure out how to use against them, use their biggest strengths against them. So you need to move fast. You need to build amazingly easy to use software. You need to sell it in exactly the way that your early customers want to buy it. Not forever. You’ll adjust that eventually. You’ll raise prices eventually. Right now, I would come in, I’m assuming if they’re big players in the space, that big brand names that they’ve raised their prices over and over and over because that’s the playbook and it leaves a ton of room below them, to be cheaper. And cheap is not your number one value prop I would say, but it is part of that package. You have to do all this stuff. And you find these hated competitors and you basically look to recruit refugees from them who just want out. So that is the number 1, 2, 3, and 4 things I would be doing to use my big competitor’s strengths against them. My next question is from Dylan about when it’s warranted to lower prices.  Dylan:Hey there, Rob, this is Dylan Pierce from Cleveland, Ohio. Thanks for taking the time to answer my last question. It’s been a few months and your answer was really helpful. So my new question for you is, have you ever had a scenario where you realized that you had to lower your pricing? I know the mantra is to always find ways to increase your price, and that makes sense. Differentiation your bootstraps, you can’t necessarily compete in the race to the bottom. But what are some signals where you found that your market, you just absolutely need to lower prices to be competitive? So some background for me, I’ve built a product that integrates with eCommerce platforms. This product uses computer vision and it’s typically reserved for banks and FinTech or startups that have a developer team that they can integrate over APIs and have that complexity to onboard. Whereas my solution is a simple plug-and-play app and it adds this functionality with the eCommerce use case in mind. I’ve been noticing recently that there’s been churn due to competitors that have much lower pricing but take a different approach than I do, less quality. But at the same time, I also rank number one for the key terms I care about. So I am considering lowering pricing just because of the pushback I’m getting from new leads as well as retaining existing customers due to a lower priced, in my opinion, a lower quality approach. But in the end, it seems like the sensitivity to quality isn’t so high. So at what point would you consider lowering prices? What are your thoughts on that? Thanks.  Rob Walling:I love this question because it’s not something that we tend to talk about very much on the show, because frankly it is so rare in my decades of doing this and then advising and investing. I can think of definitely two companies. I mean, I’m talking thousands and thousands that I’ve seen and that I’ve advised to raise prices and all that. I think two for sure that I can think of by name, and there’s got to be at least one or two more. So it can happen. There is absolutely a time when the signals are pointing to you lowering prices. And usually, the signals are pretty much what you’re saying. If you’re getting a lot of churn because your customers are going to a competitor and they’re siding price as the number one issue, or if you’re losing deals, if you’re doing more high-touch sales, sounds like you’re not doing that, you’ll get a sense that like, “Ooh, we’re too expensive.” Now, you’re always going to have complaints about price. And in fact, if you’re not getting any complaints about price, then your price is too low. But in this case, yes, can there be signals? There can be. And it sounds like you might be in that position right now. Churn and losing deals are the number one and two, right? It’s people putting their money where their mouth is. And if their switching costs are low out of your product to another one, that makes it even more painful. If switching costs are high, it’s a little less motivation for you to need to lower prices. But obviously, you can either raise prices too much. You can just keep increasing, increasing to where you kind of lose product market fit or where you’re the most expensive product in your space in your category and you don’t provide any additional value, then yeah, you’re overpriced. Especially the more of a commodity you are, it really is a race on price. The more of a brand you are that people just know you and you’re the best and no one gets fired for buying IBM, these days it’s Salesforce or HubSpot, Intercom. These are these expensive tools and it’s like, “Well, how can they charge so much?” Because they can. Because they’re a brand and they’re trusted and they integrate with everybody and no one gets fired for using them. So in your case, would I lower prices? I would certainly consider it if I was losing deals and if I was churning to these other competitors. Even if it’s an inferior product, I would certainly try to figure out a way to better communicate that. But if you’re doing low touch sales and you are viewed as a relative commodity to these other apps, it’s something I’d consider. Here’s the other thing, is can you think about lowering prices on the low end? So your entry level plans, the published plans so to speak, such that you are an obvious… You’re at parity with these other solutions or maybe you’re 10% more or whatever. But then as folks graduate up to tiers, as they get more value from your product, as they get more usage out of your product, that the price does increase with the value that you provide. That’s how I’d be thinking about it. Thanks for your question. I hope that was helpful. My next question is from anonymous about pursuing career growth versus staying and building on the side.  Speaker 6:Hi Rob. I’m relatively new to the startups for the rest of this universe, but I’ve been loving the podcast and the SaaS Playbook. They’ve helped make what has long been an abstract goal of self-employment seem realistic, actionable, and attainable. Now to my question. I’ve been at my current company for almost a decade, which as I’m sure you know is an eternity in software time. I’ve learned a ton and I’ve had lots of opportunities for growth, which is why I’ve stayed. Lately though, I’ve been feeling like I’ve reached the extent of my growth potential here and the grass is starting to look greener elsewhere. I think a move to a different company would let me learn a lot more about how other businesses function and grow and might help spur more of my own startup ideas by exposing me to other teams and industries. I’m also concerned that staying at the same company for much longer will limit my future employability. Startups don’t seem to like seeing 10 plus years of tenure on a resume. On the other hand, I have stability, flexibility, and institutional knowledge here, which means more free time to develop my own ideas and hopefully start on the stair-step approach or start bootstrapping something meaningful. If I make a move, that means that I’ll have to put in more intense time at work learning about a new product, code base, and team, and I’d be starting over on trust and stability. I know it’s hard to give specific advice based on a high-level overview, but I’m wondering if you have any general thoughts on this type of situation. Pursue career moves that might pay off long-term or use the current stability and flexibility to focus on building on the side right now? Thanks for your time. I really appreciate your work.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I appreciate the question. And you’re correct, I can’t give you direct advice about this because it’s your life and it’s your career. The way I think about it though is timing and timeline. If you move to another job now, I think in the long run it will benefit you. It’s likely to benefit you for the reasons you said of being exposed to new ways of doing things and new code bases and all that. The question is, do you have the months? I don’t think it’s years, but you’re definitely going to lose months of building back that trust and learning code bases and this and that in your life right now. I don’t know how old you are. I don’t know if you’re planning to have a child in 12 months. And so you have some kind of timeframe. Or if it’s like [inaudible 00:21:36], it’s looser, like, “I have 3, 4, 5 years to make this work,” then I think playing the long game, I probably would look for another job. You’re also likely to get a raise when you do that. You get exposed to new things. So all things being equal, I tend to want to do the thing that’s going to expose me to new experiences. That maybe makes me a little uncomfortable because I don’t love change myself and changing a job always came with uncertainty. Sometimes that uncertainty was a good thing and sometimes it wasn’t. Sometimes the job change was good and sometimes it wasn’t. I would lean towards being exposed to new people, expanding your network because now you have your old network, all the people you work with at your old company, you have the people you work with at your new company. It’s beneficial. But again, to me, it comes down to what is your time pressure in terms of your life timeline that you need to fit within in order to have enough revenue and what timeframe to quit the day job. So I hope you don’t take that as direct advice, but just a thought experiment of how I would think about it. My next question and the final question for the day is about cap tables.  Steve:Hey Rob, this is Steve Davis, a long time listener and a periodic correspondent. I was wondering if sometime you could do a deep dive into cap tables. It seems to be something that can cause people trouble later in their business. And I know you’ve had some great ideas like everyone earning in and such. So I hope you cover this sometime. And again, thank you for years of both insight and entertainment. Have a great holiday season. Bye-Bye.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Steve. It’s good to hear from you after emailing with you a bit over the years. So for this one, I don’t know that I need to do a deep dive. It honestly doesn’t feel that complicated to me. I think I have three rules that I’m going to give you. First, I’m going to define what a cap table is for those who don’t know. It’s short for capitalization table. All it means is who owns what shares in your company, who owns what percentage of your company. And at the start, it’s one line. You can put it in a Google sheet. Most startups that I’ve seen are managing it in an Excel sheet or a Google Doc and it’s like, “This founder owns this much or we just know that that it is in the operating agreement” or whatever. When it gets complicated is if you take outside investors, if you create a stock option plan, if you take safes, which are a promise of future equity at a certain cap, then it starts to become muddy of how much. It’s not muddy per se, but it can be confusing if you don’t have it all mapped out of how much you and everyone else on the cap table owns and will own when that equity converts. So my simple, easy to remember, Rob’s patented rules to managing your cap table, number one, is everyone vests, even founders. So if you start a company with one other co-founder, both of you should vest into your equity. That just means that you have to work there for years in order to receive 100% of your equity grant. Usually, it’s a four-year vesting period. Standard is four with a one-year cliff, meaning you get zero equity until 12 months. Sometimes with founders, you wave the cliff and people get it from month one. You can talk to a lawyer and see what they say, but a big mistake that founders make with their cap table is not having people vest. You start a company with one other person, they walk away after six months. If they own 50% of your company, company’s DOA at that point. You will never raise funding for that company. You’ll be working to put money in the pocket of that founder who left. It’s catastrophic for the company and it’s not something you want to do. So everyone vest. Number two is, it’s a loose world of thumb, but don’t sell more than 10 or 20% of your company in a single round. So for example, we have seen companies apply to TinySeed that we wanted to fund. And if the founders, by the time they reach us between one, two or three of them, however many there are, if they own less than 80% of their company, we start to ask questions. And if they own less than 70%, it’s a bad sign. So we’ve seen some folks come in where it’s a single founder where sold 70% of his company to an early investor for not enough money to be honest. That’s tough. It’s really tough, because again, it makes the business… I’m not saying it’s DOA, but it’s like do you want to put in five or 10 years of work into this thing to basically line the pockets as someone who wrote you a check several years ago for not that much money? So loose rule of thumb, even tight rule of thumb is I would be super suspect if I was selling more than… If you’re doing a bootstrap or funding round, it’s like 10 or 15%. Sometimes you can sell 20%. I’ve seen it venture, it’s more 20 or 25. But in our space, in the MicroConf indie space, it’s in that 10 to 15% ranges where I would be sticking if I was going to raise funding. And the third point or rule is understand your safes and your convertible notes. So this is where you understand what it is and how it works. Safe is a promise of future equity. Convertible note will convert in the future and give whoever gave you that loan. Convertible note is technically on the books a loan that you’re paying interest on, but then it converts to equity at a certain point. Usually it’s your next funding round or it’s after X amount of years. We’ve seen a founder, we’ve seen multiple founders who didn’t understand their safes and were telling us, “No, I see. I own 90% of the company.” And we’re like, “No. When that safe converts, they own 80%, 90%.” In one case, I think it was actually 100%. It was a bizarre case. But really understand, like don’t DIY your own legal. This is where you don’t do your own legal yourself. Here are things I don’t skimp on. Tattoos, LASIK surgery, and legal, and shoes actually. Those are the four. I’m sure there are more than that. But these are things that are important to get right the first time, because if you screw them up, it’s not good down the line. So if you’re going to raise any type of funding, but certainly if it’s going to be safes and convertible notes, understand what that’s going to do to your cap table. And when you’re in these early stages before you’ve… Let’s say you’re going to raise venture down the line, you really need to own the vast majority of your company before you get to that pre-seed and seed round because if you don’t, you’re going to get diluted down to nothing by the time you get to the point where you have a liquidity event. So thanks for that question, Steve. I hope it was helpful for you and for other listeners. One of the callers today mentioned the SaaS Playbook and I realized the other day it’s crossed 20,000 copies sold. So it is quickly catching up to my best-selling book of all time, Start Small, Stay Small. What’s interesting is I posted to Twitter probably six or eight weeks ago that the SaaS Playbook had crossed 10,000 copies sold. Turns out, I did my math wrong. I actually missed an entire swath of books that had sold and it was probably closer to 14,000 or 15,000 when I posted that. And since then it’s crossed 20,000, which is incredible. Start Small, Stay Small, I had always had in my head that it had sold like 15,000, 16,000, 17,000 in that realm. I logged in to just Amazon KDP and it was well over 20,000 just there. It doesn’t include Audible, it doesn’t include all my direct sales. So I’ve now realized that I should probably keep better track of this just so I know. I like to know the numbers. Start Small, Stay Small as a self-published book has now sold more than 30,000 copies. Pretty incredible. I want to get an exact number on that. I need to go back through my records. But as a self-published book, I’m going to be honest, it feels pretty incredible. Now, that book has been out for 14 years now. So for the SaaS Playbook in eight months, 20,000, so it’s catching up quickly and still selling, I don’t know, 800 copies a month, 1,000 copies a month right now. It feels really good. And it feels like I talked about playing the long game in episode 700. This is all that coming to fruition, right? To be able to write a book, given the years of experience that I have and both the hard knocks that I’ve learned, but also now learning through the hard knocks of others to be able to put it in a book and then be able to get the distribution and get the word of mouth. I mean, not a day goes by that I don’t see some type of mention of MicroConf or the podcast or SaaS Playbook somewhere out there on social media or Reddit, Hacker News. So I really appreciate you being part of this community, this community of misfits as we call it these days with MicroConf, and this community, this audience of this podcast, and just taking it all in and helping promote. I guess it’s this mission that bootstrapping is actually, in a lot of cases, in most cases, is the right call. We don’t have to be prisoners to this narrative that the venture industrial complex tells us that we’re not important if we don’t raise funding, we’re not important if we don’t sell for a billion dollars. That we are actually changing a lot of lives for the better. Whether you’re bootstrapping or you’re helping others bootstrap, this community is incredibly supportive and I find it incredibly motivating to be part of it. So thanks for showing up this week and every week.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I talk with Matt Wensing, the founder of Summit, about his long journey, multi-year journey, finding product market fit. While I’m not recording a series of podcast episodes about product market fit, this does remind me of Ruben Gomez’s episode maybe, what, four or five ago, where he talked about the long journey to finding it and then finding it with a certain subset of customers and certain features and then realizing, oh, the API is a completely different product I now have to find product market fit for. And in this episode, Matt Wensing and I just talk about his journey with Summit over the past. I think we talk about it in the episode. It’s took four years, four plus years of building, talking to customers, launching, finding out he kind of hit the mark, made some revenue, found out that wasn’t the right tool. So then he went back to zero basically and started again building new features. You might know Matt from Twitter or from his podcast that wrapped up just a few months ago called Out Of Beta. Before we dive into that, applications for TinySeed are opening on February 12th and close on February 25th. If you’re not familiar with TinySeed, it’s the accelerator I run for ambitious, mostly bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders. Even if you’re interested in applying outside of the window of February 12th to February 25th, you can join our mailing list to be notified when applications open again, visit TinySeed.com/apply to get on the mailing list or to apply. I want to invite you to MicroComp Remote Early Stage SaaS Sales Strategies. It’s an online event we’re hosting March 12th and 13th of 2024. It runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Time on those two days. And there will be sessions all focused on early stage SaaS sales led by Rachel Leow, Craig Hewitt, Daniel Ebert, Sam Howard, I’ll be MCing. And we’re going to cover strategies to boost your close rate, build a sustainable sales process, and figure out how to overcome the challenges of selling as a technical founder. We’ll also have daily founder mixer sessions where you’ll get to meet other attendees to network and chat about what you’re working on. Tickets are inexpensive and they are available at microcompremote.com. So with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Matt. Matt Wensing, welcome back to the show.  Matt Wensing:Thanks, Rob.  Rob Walling:It’s great to have you, man. So last time, I think you’ve been on the show two or three times, but last time was in November of 2022, episode 633 titled Building SaaS Plus A Two-Sided Marketplace. And in that episode we talked through how you started Summit was originally Sim SaaS and it was SaaS simulation and forecasting tool. You renamed it to Summit, which is a really good call by the way, usesummit.com if folks want to check it out. Then you pivoted or narrowed focus or whatever you want to call it into low-code calculators, simulations, forecasts. Then you were calculators for sales and marketing I believe. And today your H one is everything you need to start scoring leads and you have just, it’s been like what, three years, four years? And you’ve traveled a lot of H ones, sir. So that’s what I want to talk about today is how you’re feeling about where you are, how it’s working, how it’s been, how it’s going. Yeah,  Matt Wensing:That’s great. I love that Traveled H ones. Yeah, I’d like to think that the way back machine would be an honest way to look at everyone’s H ones through that light. It’s a favorite thing of mine, but it’s been a while. And during the last, I guess call it 14, 15 months since we last talked on this show, we have really done two things. First of all, we added sales and marketing as our target market. Sales and marketing are gigantic. I mean each of those words contains millions of people and hundreds of job titles I would say we’re even more focused in marketing now. And what we learned in 2023 was shortly after we talked, I started doing sales and selling really to those teams that we had found in the sort of early days of figuring out sales and marketing as a use case or a target market, and working with them just realizing that what we were doing was relatively high touch. It was working with some pretty strong brands, et cetera, that have pretty robust marketing teams. And when they do things, it’s a project and they take it on as a project, and that just means that there’s a lot of collaboration needed, a lot of conversation, et cetera. And so in that sense, what we had was a good fit because it was this broad platform for sales and marketing. As I said, calculators that are low code, no code, you can build them without an engineering deployment or degree. And that was a really great fit for that sales motion. But what we decided at the end of the year, and this was just a short three months ago now, was we look back at 2023 and said, okay, we’ve done this work for these clients. We want more customers and we want to acquire more customers more quickly. How do we do that? And that meant we wanted to reopen self-serve. And what we found was just this broadly appealing, broadly positioned and broadly expressed platform. It was perfect for those sales again and those conversations. But when you come to a website and it says that if you go through self-service, it’s not really clear what you’re getting. It’s not really clear what’s on the other side. So we really needed to really pick a lane to run in for self-serve to be viable.  Rob Walling:So that was just a few months ago. And I guess how is it because everything’s an experiment until it’s not, right, and so how’s it going today? How do you feel about the H one? How do you feel about the move back to self-serve in terms of growth, in terms of your confidence in that decision?  Matt Wensing:Yeah, so what we were trying to fix, maybe we’ll talk about that. What we were trying to fix ultimately was a top of funnel challenge, I would say. And what that meant was, and there’s a lot of ways to solve that. So in some sense we just said, “Hey, we can just tweet more buy ads, LinkedIn, whatever it is, we can get the name out there and we can send people to the site.”  But then it was sort of then what? And so we didn’t have a lot of confidence that if we invested in those grow the funnel activities, that people would come to the site and they would have this eureka moment around, I know what this is, I know what it’s for. And in fact, I was kind of thinking about wanting one of these. It wasn’t an existing product category. That’s how some people would put it. And so by choosing an existing product category, which is lead scoring now, we solved a bunch of problems that really I think would’ve wrecked the ship if we had opened up self-service without doing that. And that means that what we’re seeing now is okay, people come to the site, they comment on our posts on LinkedIn saying, I know what this is sort of thing, and this is really cool and I like this. And they tag their sales team member in on it and say, “Hey, we were just talking about this. That’s really exciting.” And we’ve had enough people go through the onboarding, at least in the first, we just announced this, I think January, let’s call it 15th or so ish. We waited for Christmas. So we launched it literally three or four days before Christmas. We didn’t tell anybody because it’s not when you want anybody either filing a support ticket or struggling to onboard themselves. But we also didn’t want to come back to, I mean, you know the feeling. Coming back the first week of January to an unfinished project is just a terrible feeling. So we got it out there and it’s been live, it’s been announced for about a week. We’ve had a few dozen people I’ll share go through the onboarding and we are learning where they stop, where they continue, et cetera. Now we also have a seven-day trial, so very early in terms of data, but so far the data is this, people come to the site, they click the try it free button, they start going through the onboarding, and that’s awesome because that wasn’t happening before. So now it’s like, okay, great, we have some volume coming in now it’s an optimization game or a what’s broken game or a leaky bucket problem, whatever you want to use to say let’s get them all the way through now. And now I’m kind of in a world, it’s funny, we’ve known each other for a while, TinySeed batch one. And so in a lot of ways now that we have this existing product category and people are coming and they’re coming through our funnel in some sense, a lot of the advice that I was hearing my batch mates get in the first batch, TinySeed, where they’re like, oh, got this many people signing up, but this many people are completing whatever, what do I do? That’s all very relevant for us now in sunset.  Rob Walling:And that’s the perfect time for people to join TinySeed is once they have a little bit of traction. You were in batch one and we took some flyers, we backed people. You were one of the early, you didn’t even have a product in market, I don’t think.  Matt Wensing:No.  Rob Walling:And what we realized pretty quickly is, A, it takes a lot longer than we all think. You thought you’d have product market fit in six months and it’s a few years later. And then as TinySeed, the advice I can give, give someone an early stage advice, but it’s like what’s the advice? It’s like go learn stuff until you figure it out. And once you figure it out and you’re at five grand a month, maybe six, seven, eight grand a month, TinySeed I think is really designed for that stage, which is why we do that. The SaaS playbook is 100% written for that as well. It’s like you have some customers, you have a loose, loose product market fit and you’re trying to strengthen it. And that is the more I can be really prescriptive at that point stuff before that, I have this whole book, it’s like 30,000 words written. It’s called Idea to Launch or Idea Attraction, something like that. But it’s a lot of like, and then you have to go with your gut feel and there’s a founder vision that you then have all this noisy noise coming at you and you’re trying to figure out which of these do I listen to? And it’s hard decisions with incomplete information, really incomplete.  Matt Wensing:So that’s the data side. Empirically, I don’t have results that I’m going to be doing flips about. It’s not sales zero. We have some trials going on, which is great. But the bigger thing is as a team, and maybe this is more of founder CEO hat on, for the team to have that clarity around this is the initial sort of killer app or use case that we’re bringing to market. We can run that prescriptive playbook, if you will. We can look at problems and we don’t have to question, well, maybe no one in the world needs this. Right? That’s a very sick thought to have or makes you sick sort of thought to have in the early days. So you’re like, I just don’t know if people even want this thing. So to have that in the rear-view I would say is the biggest benefit. And honestly, now the only thing that comes up is people, past customers or people who’ve heard this story before will go, “Wait, wait, I thought you were way broader. I thought you did way more than that.” And I have to just tell them, and I’ll use this podcast as an opportunity to say, we still have all that. But we just realized that if that was the front door, people were just going to stand there and go, “Wow, I don’t even know where to begin.” And that’s not good.  Rob Walling:Right. And niching down to either roles, like you said, marketing or sales or niching down to use cases is because the paradox of choice or even the paradox of understanding of how do I come to the website, I read the H one and I’m like, that’s not a category. I don’t … What is this? And then I have to read your H two and then I have to read your, and that is not, that’s like death because people aren’t going to spend the time to understand it.  Matt Wensing:Exactly. And I think what you get is when you’re very broad, you get people who are just, I’m willing to try anything. So music is a fun category. It’s like imagine if you were like, we help you create awesome music. If that was your H one, you’re going to get some cool kids if you will, to try out whatever the heck it is because they’re musicians. But it’s not until you say like, oh, we improve the quality of your audio tracks specifically at this frequency or whatever. It’s like, okay, now the mainstream who uses Ableton Live and all these other things, GarageBand, they’re like, oh, I know where that fits in. And actually I need one of those and then go back to Wayback Machine. And I love this. Look at WP Engine, great example. They’re like the experiential platform for blog hosting on the internet now or whatever. But back in the day, it was safe, fast and secure WordPress hosting, and I think they might’ve even gone back, but they had to be narrow to start. I think we all had to be narrow to start. We were broad to start to find our narrow, if you will, to find that use case. And then we had about four days of meetings in Q4 and said, you know what? This use case makes a lot of sense. Let’s go all in on that. And so far so good.  Rob Walling:So there are definitely people listening to this right now who are where you were six, 12, 18 months ago, which is I’ve launched something and it’s not getting the traction that I want fast enough. And people don’t quite get it. And there’s 100 different paths you could go down. There’s 20 different things you could try. You have customers telling you stuff, you have advisors telling you stuff, you have your own gut, you have team members, you have all, I said it earlier, noisy noise, which is a dumb phrase, but you just got a bunch of noise and a bunch of coming at you that you have to filter and then make decisions. So how did you do that? Because I’ve done a couple talks about this, about it’s very fuzzy and I like to hear different people’s takes on it because much product market fit, everyone seems to have a different definition of it. Everyone seems to have a different approach for what you’ve been doing for the past couple years. So what was your process like and who did you listen to and how did you know who to listen to?  Matt Wensing:Yeah, we started out the year, I would say customers obviously number one. And that came from, I would say there are actually times to not listen to your current customers. And I say current, underlining current because those customers are not the ones that are going to get you to your dreams or where you’re trying to go. Forget dreams, the next milestone. It’s like, oh shoot, we’ve got to change customer base. We didn’t have to do that. So we got to say, great, whatever we’re hearing from customers, obviously they’re humans. We have to deal with the fact of their current priorities are not tomorrows and it’s all changing, but we got to read between the lines, do a good job of interviewing them, really understand how they work. And being in Slack channels with a dozen or more customers all year last year, I learned a ton about how marketing is being done in 2023 and now 2024. So that helped. And then I would say the other thing we did, and I’m just going to add, there’s a wide variety of frameworks and ways you can think about this. The one that really helped us here was follow the workflow. So what we found was it was, okay, we’re building lead magnets for people in a high touch way. They’re using our platform to build these magnets. We’re helping them. It’s a mix. It’s high touch. What we really said after that is like, okay, we know we want to launch self-service. We know we want this to be turnkey. Let’s follow the workflow. And what happens after a lead gets captured by a lead magnet? What’s the very next thing that people want to do with it? And we say, oh, well, they have to triage, they qualify it, right? Is this a good lead? Is this a bad lead, et cetera. So for us it was sort of like it’s just the next step in the workflow for us is where we found this. And then we started to look at that. Okay, okay, is that universal? Is there an app there? Is there a use case? Oh yeah, lead qualification. Oh, is there a mathematical component to that? We’re all these calculator … Oh yeah, scoring. Well shoot. It’s kind of like right there. And then the more we ask, we’re like, okay, existing category, it’s kind of sleepy, meaning I like to say it’s the Baltic Avenue of the monopoly board. It’s not the boardwalk or the park place where there’s just obviously it’s super fancy and everybody’s in on it and it’s super competitive. It’s kind of like, okay, yeah, it’s a category, but it’s not super competitive. So it felt like also a step in the workflow where we could bring a better product to market and stand up well in any kind of comparison with other products that are out there, differentiation, all that. So I would say the three things really, customers understand their workflows following those to a step in the journey that was adjacent to us and then saying, can we compete at this step? And once we said, we were like, okay, that’s really cool because that step is actually very narrow by comparison to build a lead magnet from scratch, which is like a no-code exercise of a blank canvas. This is, hey, I’ve got an email address and I need to turn it into a score from zero to 100. And everybody basically needs to do the same thing. And the only difference is you have a different definition of a ideal customer than I do. So you’re like, okay, that has a nice scalability to it. So in this case, it was following the workflow. In other cases, it’s a different tool. That’s why these things are fun. It’s like just have a toolbox full of these ways of looking at it.  Rob Walling:And so lead scoring, if folks aren’t familiar with that, can you tell who uses that and what the purpose of it is?  Matt Wensing:Yes. This was another interesting thing. There’s actually two things people think about when it comes to lead scoring. First is the traditional definition. If you have HubSpot or something and you look at an article that says how to do lead scoring or close partner of ours, you’ll see an article that says, hey, somebody came to your website, they sign up for a webinar that’s 10 points. They downloaded an ebook, that’s five points, et cetera. And you build a score based on the behaviors of visitor or prospect, and that score just grows over time. The other one is what we just hinted at. Hey, Rob comes to my website. I need to know if Rob is a qualified prospect, should I even reach out to Rob? Is he worth my time? Just based on what data is in Clearbit or what data the world knows about Rob. And so Summit offers both. So we can both take an email address and you define your ideal custom profile. We match them up and we say, Hey, Rob is a great fit based on what you’re looking for. Actually Rob is not who you’re looking for because it’s a Gmail address. Or he works works at a massive company and you’re selling to SMBs, whatever it is. So I like to put those on two axes. One is behavior scoring. Is Rob acting like he has the intent to purchase something? And the other one is just persona fit scoring is Rob the shape of person we’re looking for? And obviously the best case is high intent, high fit. And then you can kind of think from there of low intent, low fit.  Rob Walling:And I’m familiar with lead scoring because we built it into Drip. It was a feature for us, but it wasn’t like this. So you actually go out to Clearbit and you augment the leads and then you get job titles, this and that. Since we were an email marketing platform, we basically did it based on folks interactions with your website. We had JavaScript on your site, how many emails they opened and clicked. And you could define, we had predefined lead scoring of like, hey, for every open, it’s one point added and for every click it’s three or whatever. But you could then go in and change that. So it’s pretty configurable, but that’s different. That’s activity based lead scoring. It said nothing about your ICP, it’s just their really into what you’re writing. That’s what we had and we had planned to go out and augment and we never got there. It wasn’t important enough for us. But the reason I bring that up is it was a feature of Drip, and I’d imagine it’s a feature of CRMs or HubSpots or Salesforce. I don’t know. I’ve never used it, but I’m sure it’s in them. So how are you thinking about that as this is your whole product as lead scoring, but it can be a feature of other. Is there danger there?  Matt Wensing:Yeah, there is danger there. And I’ll say that if our company, if we didn’t still have that broad platform in the background, this would be a risk. And the risk is, I raised venture money, we raised venture money, we’re going big. I don’t think you can build the kind of scale company that I want to build based on just this product category, which as you said, is for many people as a feature. Now there are companies that are out there, competitors, you can look them up if you type in lead scoring, you see a lot of their ads where they’re charging 500 bucks a month, a thousand bucks a month, $3,000 a month for lead scoring. And frankly, we’re doing kind of the same thing for a lot less and more scalably. We have that benefit of releasing something recently and all the modern tech that you get to bring to bear on the problem. So it is a category, it’s not just a feature, but it’s pretty small. It in terms of it is not a venture scale category. So if somebody came to you and said, “Hey, I want to build an entire company, the lead scoring, I want to raise five million bucks.” That doesn’t make sense. It’s not big enough. But given our goals as a company right now, the way I talk about it internally is, Hey guys, we want to be, we are a platform, but what good is a platform without a killer app or game or use case? I said up until now, we’ve basically been the, hey, here’s a PlayStation and we also include this ability to build your own PlayStation game. And you’re like, very few people-  Rob Walling:[inaudible 00:20:51] this is not fun at all.  Matt Wensing:And some people think it sounds extremely fun, and that’s like the 0.0001% and then 99% repeating of people go, I was looking for a game I could just play. I’m just looking for fun. So I said, look, we’re selling our first game. We hope this is a killer game. It’s bundled into the platform. It’s like the cartridge that comes included, and that’s enough. We think we can sell enough of that game, if you will, to drive enough console sales to extend the metaphor to get ourselves to the revenue milestone we have next. And that means that, hey, when we get to that milestone, it’s sort of like, Hey, what game do we want to create next? Do we want to create something completely different? Probably related, but then we can branch out. But the risk would be, yeah, hey, this is the whole platform is about this. And fortunately we didn’t have to do that. Believe it or not, the lead scoring product, if you will, is literally just an app that we built using our own platform and technology. So when you get a license or a subscription, you’ll see that app suddenly show up in your own library of things. And it’d be like having a file included with Figma or a song included with iTunes or whatever it just comes with. And that means that we really, the product itself to build probably took two or three weeks using our own platform. What took a lot longer was a lot more work was the marketing and the messaging and the positioning to narrow that focus.  Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

And so how big’s your team for context?  Matt Wensing:Three.  Rob Walling:Okay, so you’re pretty small and lean then. And you’ve mentioned that you’ve raised venture and you want to go venture scale. I want to call that out. I don’t know, 80 plus percent of the listeners are folks who want to bootstrap and probably about 80, 75% and 20, 25% are open to raising some kind of funding, at least according, I think it’s a state of independent SaaS where we ask that. But even most of those would do more of a TinySeed round or an angel round and don’t want to go venture scale, but there’s that 1% or 3% folks who want to go venture. I want to call that out because if you’re listening to this and you’re thinking about bootstrapping, this is a tough path to go down to build a big platform. And you have different goals than someone who maybe wants to exit for 10 million. And so you want to go, like you say, venture scale and it means like, no, this is 100 million, this is a billion. No, whatever. It is a huge number. What brought you to that decision? Because you bootstrapped your first company. We’ve talked about that here on the show. You had an eight figure exit. Congratulations, sir. And so why in this new one, you took TinySeed funding in the very first batch and then you’ve raised one or two rounds, I believe from venture. What was the impetus for you to make that decision?  Matt Wensing:I think I practically swore off the idea of venture when I first left my last business. I think a lot of people do because they go through it and they go, wow, it wasn’t a short journey. A lot of stuff happens downstream of it. I think with certain investors like yourself with Bryce Roberts who have more of a revenue focused mindset, fortunately you can actually leave a lot of that thinking, let’s say behind, but for me it was, okay, I’m just going to build this thing. And the more I investigated the market and the more I built to address what I found, I sort of found that gap and I realized this gap is actually really, really big and it’s very horizontal. And so now actually when I look at it, I go, okay, we’re solving lead scoring, which is a mathematical problem in the marketing space, if you will, but the need for math in the marketing space is kind of endless. And so it’s this really thin layer that just goes out forever, if you will. And I really spent the first several years of this, well, I say I spent the first six to 12 months of this going, I’m not doing that, I’m not doing that again. I’m just going to have my little nice little shoe store in the corner. Or as others say, my nice little Italian restaurant, there’s a coffee shop, that’s what we’re going to do. But then I found this thing and it was really broad and horizontal, but then it took raising venture capital and it took years of market discovery to figure out, okay, how big is it? No, really, how big is it? Who needs it? Where do they need it now? And really to deliver something to the market that can create revenue today but still holds onto that big vision. I think that’s the challenge of going the venture path in 2024 even is, unless you’re going to be the raised gobs of money and [inaudible 00:26:40] this doesn’t matter, I think that’s gone. I think the real challenge even the venture folks have now is how do I have a gigantic vision but then ship something quickly that gets to revenue quickly? And that’s a whole different muscle right? Now we know how challenging that is. Doing both is, it’s very hard. It’s very hard.  Rob Walling:And I want to call out that you have raised venture, and when people hear that, usually they think scale up, hire a bunch of employees. That’s usually the path for it. You have not done that. And in fact, if you had, you probably would’ve run out of money. I mean, the odds are pretty, if you’d scaled up to 10, 15, 20 employees too early, that’s the problem with, so some people say, well, don’t raise funding too early. And I say, but you can raise it early. Just don’t scale up too early. Because if you’re still trying to find product market fit and you’re still kind of narrowing or pivoting or whatever term we want to use for it, and you’re at 15 or 20 people and you have to just reorient the Titanic every six months, it’s not even that many people, but 15 versus three-  Matt Wensing:Way different.  Rob Walling:Worlds apart, right?  Matt Wensing:Yeah, I agree. We stayed small. I mean, the most we’ve ever had is four people, which was contractors and a couple employees working on it. And that has allowed us to explore this market opportunity for years. It’s allowed us to build a technology, a no-code platform from scratch, which just takes time. It’s not even just that it takes time to write the lines of code. It’s knowing what lines of code to write based on the market, and there is no one source of information out there that you can just go to get all the answers and then build the thing to spec in three months. And so the bigger the opportunity, you kind of need more time to steep in market and in those conversations and ideas to figure out where is it really? Because when we go in, we want to go in, we want to go all in, but we’ve got to be really sure. And I think the going all in part is just like you said, you hire enough people, you’ve basically created this complex system of scaling that back is super hard. Imagine you have 10 or 15 people and you’re like, I don’t even know if we can reduce this to two or three people at this point because I don’t know how to do seven of the things that are being done by other people. You’ve created, unfortunately, this thing where you remove one or a large enough chunk and the whole thing just kind of implodes. And that’s where these companies get, it’s not like when you have 1,000 employees, you can suddenly scale it back to 100 and still keep going. You can very easily set off a spiral.  Rob Walling:And so we’ve talked a little bit about ICP, you use that phrase ideal customer profile. Who is yours today? If someone’s listening to this, we have marketers who listen to this, sales folks, we got developers, we got whatever. But if someone’s thinking like, well, is something I could use, whether it’s your day job or in their own company, who do you think it’s ideal for?  Matt Wensing:Yeah, this is ideal for a company that is investing already pretty heavily in customer acquisition. So if you’re still not really doing that or you’re founder-led sales, I think when you’re doing founder-led sales, you’re sort of just, I’ll talk to anybody, right, at that stage. Beyond that, you get to the point of saying, we’re acquiring leads. And I’ll give you an example. Ideal customer who is a customer of ours already that I was talking to yesterday, they’re spending a good amount on paid acquisition. And they’re essentially, if you want to look at buying leads, buying email addresses to not have a quick and easy way to qualify those at scale. So you’re getting hundreds a month, thousands a month, you are going to waste resources in outreach, phone calls, discovery calls, et cetera. And you might be like, oh, what does an email cost you? Well, even emailing an unqualified lead cost you something because it’s not just the penny cost to send it or whatever, the micro pennies, it’s the, this is spam, this is irrelevant. I am not interested in this. Or even just somebody wasting your time with the call. So it’s companies that are, I would say, acquiring customers pretty aggressively in terms of paid acquisition or they have a lot of inbound organic and they want to give VIP treatment to customers that are just phenomenal opportunities, but they no longer have time to, you get a trial sign up and you’re at that stage, you get a trial sign up and you’re like, ooh, I’m going to go type in that web address. I’m going to look them up on LinkedIn. You kind of this manual little grunt work to figure out who this is. And you’re like, pop in champagne. It’s somebody that’s actually a big logo. You can’t do that anymore. When that doesn’t scale, then you’re a good fit for this. When you get to the point where you’re like, I have more email addresses than I can do that lookup for, I wish I had a way to just start to, again, sift through these and figure out which ones are worth my time, worth a personal touch. And I think these days with automation and AI and all the, it’s even more valuable then to give that personal touch to people who are really great fit and that’s who we’re a great fit for. So I would say put it on numbers perspective, scaling up. So million plus AR, probably sales hires have been there for a while. You kind of know what you’re doing and now you’re investing in SDRs or customer acquisition lead gen to get more people in the door.  Rob Walling:Matt Wensing, thanks for joining me on the show, man. People want to keep up with you. You are on Twitter, x.com/mattwensing. I don’t call it XI, I’m going to call it Twitter until, because they still redirect.  Matt Wensing:They do.  Rob Walling:I just want [inaudible 00:31:57] x.com and it goes to twitter.com. So I’m like, no, it’s still Twitter. I’m not changing this thing, the icon. You know what tripped me out is on my iPhone to get to Twitter, you pull it down and now if you search for T-W-I-T-T-E-R, it doesn’t show up. You have to type in X. So they’ve done it on the iPhone already and I’m waiting for the internet to catch up.  Matt Wensing:Out of my cold dead hands.  Rob Walling:I know, that’s how I feel. Anyways, man, thanks so much for coming back on the show.  Matt Wensing:Thanks for having me,  Rob Walling:Rob. And once again, usesummit.com if folks want to check out Summit. Thanks to Matt for joining me again this week, and thanks to you for coming back this and every week. As a reminder, I published a book middle of last year called The SaaS Playbook. It is selling really well. It’s about to hit 20,000 copies. I’m pretty stoked about that. If you haven’t bought The SaaS Playbook, you can buy it directly from me, SaaSplaybook.com or head to Amazon. And if you have bought it and you’ve read it and you think it’s worth a five star review on Amazon or Audible, I would really appreciate it. It helps more people find the book. It helps me continue to drive my mission forward of multiplying the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups, and it helps keep me motivated to keep writing books and keep producing the show.

I’m Rob Walling and I am your host for this momentous 700th episode of this podcast. Today I want to talk about playing the long game. And what’s interesting is it’s a thought that I had three, four weeks ago that I threw into a topics Trello board that I maintain, and it hadn’t occurred to me that episode 700 was so close. But instead of having my friends send audio into the podcast, having my son interview me, which I actually think someone suggested and I think I’m going to do that, couldn’t pull it together for episode 700 or any of the other stunt episodes. If you go back and listen to episode 100, 200, 300 of this podcast, we did a lot of those things and they were really fun. For this one, I just wanted to do a Rob solo adventure and talk a bit about playing the long game. Before we dive into that, applications for TinySeed are opening on February 12th and close on February 25th. If you’re not familiar with TinySeed, it’s the accelerator I run for ambitious, mostly bootstrapped B2B SaaS founders. Even if you’re interested in applying outside of the window of February 12th to February 25th, you can join our mailing list to be notified when applications open. Again, visit tinyseed.com/apply to get on the mailing list or to apply. I’m going to admit I’ve actually struggled to sit down and record this episode. Normally for these solo adventures, I make a couple bulleted points and I just go. I riff. This one, I’ve struggled with… I’ve actually outlined it quite a bit, and so this episode 700, I can do it just as a normal Rob solo adventure, but there’s something that I want to convey in this episode that holds perhaps more weight than that, and it’s about this concept of playing long ball, or playing the long game. As I came up as an entrepreneur, I learned direct response marketing, and back in the old days, they talked about two types of marketers, brand marketers, which is like Coca-Cola, Procter\u0026 Gamble, Crest Toothpaste and Dove Soap, and how those marketers could spend a kajillion dollars on a Super Bowl ad just to get the exposure, whereas direct response marketers needed to have a measurable return on their investment. So if they took out ads for 100 dollars, they needed to make 110 or 150 or $200 on those ads, and be able to measure that to stay in business or to convince themselves they were making money because they didn’t have infinite runway. And as a bootstrapper I, of course, without infinite runway, quickly became a fan of this direct response marketing, not the brand marketing that folks seem to have been talking. I mean, this is early 2000s, and in the startup space, everyone was talking about building a brand and having Kid Rock at your launch party and literally taking out Super Bowl ads. And I just couldn’t afford any of that. I needed to make $2 for every dollar I put into the machine. And so what that does for you is it gives you a short-term mindset, and that can be both good and bad, right? It’s good because it motivates you to build a viable business and a business that generates revenue and profit from the start. That is a superpower of bootstrapping. But it’s bad because it teaches you to think in the short term. And for me, I rarely looked out more than a few months in my entrepreneurial journey. I never looked out 10 years and said, where might I be? Where might want to be? I always looked ahead and said, what’s the payback on these ads that I’m running right now? Can I make my money back in two months or three months? When will the SEO traffic that I’m going for justify all the time I’m investing or when will I make it to 10K a month? I think it was 8K a month actually, so I can quit my day job. And if I’ve learned anything over the past, whatever, a couple decades of being an entrepreneur, it’s to hold two things in tension, that both things can be true at the same time, right? It’s to get away from my programmer mindset, very left brain, on or off, binary ones and zeros, and to think, you know what? I kind of need to do both. I need to think in the short term, because I need to make enough money that I can quit the day job or that I can justify all this effort I’m putting into it, not hanging out with my friends, perhaps not hanging out with my family, working nights, being tired around a day job. I have to think in the short term, I need to accelerate revenue so that I can quit that day job or do whatever the other goal is. And also now, and again, I should take a step back and think about what is the next six months, 12 months, 12 years look like? When I talk about playing the long game, I do think about it as a fractal. So if you’re familiar with the fractal, if you go to a tiny, tiny piece of the California coastline and you look at it from 100 feet up and then you go to 1000 feet, 10,000 feet, 30,000 feet, the idea of a fractal is that a small piece of it repeating can start to look the same. From 30,000 feet, it can look the same as at 100 feet. It’s a different perspective, but it’s essentially a never-ending pattern. And the idea is that fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are… I’m reading a definition now, self-similar across different scales. Self-similar is interesting. But you get the idea at 100 feet, 1000 feet, 10,000 feet, 30,000 feet, a piece of the California coastline can look different. I feel that way about playing the long game. And what I mean by that is up close, the long game might be a year spent getting your SEO efforts in order. Maybe it’s two, and that can be the long game in the short term. But then the long game might be a decade or two, as your whole career unfolds, and you realize as you go that there’s a single thread tying everything that you do together. And looking at that thread and being deliberate about saying, what do I like about this and what do I want to lean into? What am I good at? What skills do I have? What do I enjoy? And doubling down on that when you have the opportunity, you don’t always have the opportunity if you’re working for someone else, you may not, but as you have the opportunity to guide your own career, I think that that’s a higher altitude fractal looking at a decade or two versus a year or two. And one example I want to give in terms of SEO is Ruben Gomez with Seinwell. He’s an often requested guest on the show, and a year or two before he launched Seinwell, which is an electronic signature app, he started his SEO efforts. He didn’t have a product, he put up a landing page, he put up a small website, he started working his SEO Magic. There’s secret sauce in there, so I’m not saying everyone could do this, but if you’re just starting out, you don’t go after electronic signature, you don’t go after electronic documents, you go after a smaller niche. That’s why I talk about it and start small. Stay small. You find a niche where you can compete as you’re learning. My first SEO efforts were with Dot-Net Invoice, and it was invoicing software, so I was trying to compete for those terms, but also it was for Windows servers, it was for vb.net, C#. There were all these kind of long tail terms that no one was competing for, and I didn’t need to make a million dollars a month. At the time, making three or $4,000 a month was absolutely life-changing. It was a few hours a month I was spending, and while I couldn’t have won for electronic signature, I certainly could rank for the Dot-Net invoicing software or asp.net invoicing application or any of those long tail terms. And so I’m saying this because what I see a lot on social media, Eye Roll, Exhale is a folks bragging about how quickly their success came, probably not telling the full story when they do, but then other folks trying to model that and wanting to seek that. And nothing is wrong with that. I was once an opportunistic young founder as well, and I wanted the success next week or next month. But in most cases, that’s not the way it goes. In most cases, you’re going to put a year or two in just to get enough SEO rankings that when you launch your electronic signature or .net invoice app, it wouldn’t have taken two years to do that. But when you launch that app, you have looked ahead and you’ve planned ahead to set yourself up for success. Another example is from season two of TinySeed Tales where Gather, which was focusing on one in two person architecture and interior design firms, they went up market and they wanted to go to five to 20-person teams. And we talked about it and they knew it was going to take months and their estimate, I don’t remember time, I think it was six months or nine months, took them 18 months to get there. And it was a harrowing 18 months. If you go back and listen to that show and then the follow-up, they almost ran out of money a couple times because they thought that they would start to accelerate and grow faster than they did. And playing the long game is leaning into that and saying, “We are going to make it. We are making progress, and there is something up ahead.” Now, again, at a certain point, there’s a chance it just wouldn’t have worked, right? When should they give up? Well, we would’ve evaluated. I would’ve asked them, do you have any more ideas? Do you have any more cash in the bank? Do you have any? What are the alternatives? And at a certain point, you have no options, and that’s usually when you quit or when you give up. In the fractal, those are the 100-foot view, right? 1000 foot view where you’re down and you’re looking at a year or two. I think about things that I had no idea how long they would take. But one of them took seven or eight years, and that was an angel investment, my first angel investment I ever made, which was into WP Engine. And frankly, any angel investment, you should think, I’m not going to… it’s probably going to go to zero, and if I get anything back, it’s going to be 10 years. That just seems to be the thing. And I didn’t really realize that in 2010, 2011, when I scraped together a couple… 20 grand I think, which was an enormous amount of money for me at the time to write Jason Cohen a check, and I was honored to be part of it, and it paid out a tremendous payout for me. And it’s probably the third most lucrative asset I have ever owned. Maybe I’ll record another podcast about… I have them in order in my head, but angel investing specifically in WP Engine is probably the thing that made me the third most money. The first one, of course, is building and selling software companies. I bet you don’t know what the second one is. But I’ll be honest, I didn’t know it was going to take seven, eight, nine years. I did assume that when I wrote the check, it was going to go to zero. And the interesting thing is Sherry and I wrote a lot of angel checks around there. I think we I think it’s 20 or 21 private investments that we’ve made, and most of them are made between 2010 or ’11 and 2014/15. And it’s such a trip now to see those either shutting down or providing returns. I just had no idea, but it really did take that eight to 10 to… well, it’s almost 14 years now, isn’t it? Yeah, it’s incredible. It’s incredible just putting in the time and how things compound. But that leads me to the question of another long ball. Why did Jason Cohen reach out to me? It was a closed round. And if Jason Cohen approached you and said, “Hey, you want to invest my next startup?” Your answer is yes. You figure out how to get the money. Again, I had never made an investment. I didn’t really have the money to invest, but I just figured this was going to work. But how did I know him at all? Well, I’d been blogging since 2005, and this is what, six years in, because I wrote Start Small, Stay Small, and he ordered a copy of that book and read it. And when he emailed me about investing, we didn’t know each other. This is, again, 2011, this is before the first MicroConf. He had never spoken at MicroConf. We had never met, I don’t even know if we’d emailed. And he said, “I’ve been reading your blog,” which of course I was reading his at the time, and he said a lot about virtual assistants, “You know about bootstrapping. I’d love to have you in the round, it’s closed round, whatever.” You can scrape together. So how did I know him? Well, he knew me because I was putting in the work. I was playing long ball. I was blogging and writing books. How do I know Darmas Shah of HubSpot? Because today, if I emailed Darmas Shah and he didn’t know me, he’d be like… he wouldn’t respond, right? He has so much going on that if you didn’t know him from the old days, he’s not going to respond. This is the same, Ben Chestnut from MailChimp, why do I know him? Eric Reese, Patio 11. Sam Parr of My First Million. Why do I know any of these people? And it’s because I’ve been doing things for 15 or 20 years, and enough of them in public. That’s the key. Now, I’m not saying that you need to go build an audience, start a podcast, start a conference, write books. I’m not saying it’s any of those things. There are people like a Ruben Gomez, like Sean Ellis, Brian Balfour, who they aren’t the audience building folks. I know Brian Balfour now has a podcast, but that’s not how they got famous. They got famous by being internet famous in our circles, by being really good at what they do and talking just enough about it that we realized these people are really smart. They did conference talks where we would catch a bunch of new ideas, because they were thinking outside the box. We hear him on podcasts. There’s other ways to do stuff in public. Ruben is another example. Even like Derek Reimer of course was on the Art of Product podcast. Before that, people still kind of knew who he was because he built Drip. And now he doesn’t have Art of Product anymore, and people still know who he is. He’s not doing a bunch of blogging. He’s on Twitter, but you wouldn’t say he’s trying to build an audience, but people learn no and respect you by the things that you ship into this world, and that can be content, but it doesn’t have to be. And here’s the thing with doing all of this; you are putting value out into the world, especially if you’re teaching educating. And please don’t be obnoxious and start teaching and educating from day one and saying, “I’ve done this and this is how everyone should do that.” Like, “Oh, I tried freemium and it doesn’t work, therefore freemium doesn’t work.” And it’s like, come on, this topic, there is prior art. Can you at least read some of the prior art and not try something once and then write it off, or not try something once and then say, this is the only way to do it? Because it’s just obnoxious and annoying. However, coming at it from a beginner’s mind and saying, “Ooh, I tried this experiment and this is what worked. What do y’all think about it?” Or, “I tried this experiment and this is what didn’t work and I’m learning and I’m on my journey.” There are ways to couch this and talk about it, that as you do become an expert, you can then talk like an expert. But you don’t need to fake it till you make it. You need to fake it till you make it internally to feel confident, but you don’t need to fake it… I hate people when they fake it online, and I know it’s like that person doesn’t know what they’re doing and they’re acting like it, right? So all that said, I think doing some stuff in public, and it doesn’t just have to be content is beneficial for you in the long term. And you might be wondering; Rob, did you know that when you started blogging, blogging in 2005 podcasting in 2010, MicroConf, 2011, TinySeed 2018 and Drip was in the midst there too and hit tail. There’s all these other overlapping things. Did I know that the 2005 start of my blog that it would lead me to write four books, put out 700 podcast episodes, start micro comp, all that? No, absolutely not. And I didn’t know what this podcast would turn into when we started it 14 years ago. Almost. I think by the time this comes out, it’ll be within a month of our 14-year anniversary. And no, I didn’t, but I realized along the way that I was onto something. That’s the thing is there’s this book about a startup founder. I don’t remember the name, and the book wasn’t very good, so even if… I remember it not being great, but he built and sold a startup really quickly, and this is probably written in the early 2000s. And it might be even be called Lucky or Smart, that might be the title of the book. But in it, he has a quote that I’ve remembered forever. This is 20 years old, and his quote was, “People ask me, were you lucky or were you smart?” And his conclusion was, “I was smart enough to know that I was getting lucky.” I’ve always loved that. That’s how I feel about my career. That’s how I feel a bit about playing long ball is you’re going to wander, you’re going to put in hard work, 700 episodes of a podcast, four books, whatever you want to call it. All these events, 30, 40 in-person events we’ve run. It’s been hard work. Has it required skill to market and building on it? Yes, Of course. Have I gotten a little lucky? Absolutely. And along that way, I’d like to think that I eventually became smart enough to know that I was getting lucky. I’m going to admit Mike and I did… I don’t think we realized what we had with MicroConf for the first seven years. We started in 2011. It wasn’t until 2018 that it really hit me what we had built and how hard it is to build a community like that and how you unique of a community it is, and how many people’s lives we changed through this podcast and that event. It makes me feel very weird to say that sentence. I don’t want to feel like I’m bragging. I don’t want you to feel like I’m congratulating myself for patting myself on the back. But I think that was to my detriment for those years that I kept saying, “Oh, it’s nothing. No, it’s not a big deal.” It is like the person you compliment and they can’t take a compliment. That’s kind of how I was with MicroConf. It was just this thing that we did and we show up and the podcaster just show up every week and ship. And in 2018, I had left Drip, I sold it in 2016, left in ’18. And we received a seven-figure cash offer to sell MicroConf. And we seriously considered it. And I’ve talked about this on the podcast before, but this was a turning point because I had basically sold everything really to fund Drip and then sold Drip. And so the only things that I had left were a blog, robwalling.com that I hadn’t written an article for in years. This podcast. And those are the things that we had left. And so the idea of selling it all and just moving on into the tabletop gaming space, which is what I was going to do. It sounded kind of appealing a fresh start, and I think it would’ve been one of my deepest regrets in my life if I had done it. I took six months off in 2018 and I went on a founder retreat. I talked to Sherry a lot, but I gave a ton of thought about what is the next chapter of my life, potentially the rest of my life look like my professional career anyways? Do I want to be known in the tabletop gaming space, become a game publisher, whatever it is, whatever I was going to do there? It’s a hobby that of course, I would turn into a job so that I wouldn’t enjoy. But on this founder retreat, I went away for a few days and I realized this is what I’ve been doing for free. This is what I’ve had to do for now 13 years. Because I think about starting the blog in oh five as kind of the start of all this for me. I know it wasn’t when the podcast MicroConf started, but it was that idea of I want to be involved in this space. I love being an entrepreneur. I love talking about entrepreneurship. I want to talk with other entrepreneurs and just be around them all the time. And there was no community. And so first we built an audience, then we built a community. And it was at that moment in 2018 on this founder retreat where I thought, I’m going all in on this before this. People don’t remember. MicroConf was just an event. We ran once a year and then twice a year in the US and Europe. That’s it. We didn’t even have a Slack channel that lasted year round. There was no state of Indie SaaS, there was no MicroConf YouTube channel, there was no mastermind matching. All the stuff that we’ve launched that people now think about MicroConf as this community. All of that started in 2019, and it was that decision in 2018 that I made with incomplete information, by the way. But there was a bit of founder gut and there was a bit of founder vision, right? Hey, this is where I want to go. And also the realization of I think now this is my legacy. And over that next year or two, that’s where this statement of my professional mission in my life is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. That became the thing. And that’s when I realized, oh, MicroConf does that. What else can we launch out of MicroConf? And we started thinking about the video vault and the YouTube channel and all this and that. During that time, it became obvious. I was writing personal angel checks to Bootstrap SaaS founders, and that’s where the idea of, well, if we raised a bunch of money, we could do that at scale. Because again, in five, seven years I had written 20 checks, that’s kind of the money we wanted to put into startups. It takes so long to come back. TinySeed, we’ve written 151 checks. So you’ll see over the past four or five years, we’ve been able to help and impact so many more founders on that mission to multiplying the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. And so if you’re listening to this, you might be thinking, how do I know that I’m in the right game, that I’m playing the right long game in the messy middle days? If I’m in the middle of all this, is it obvious? In my experience? It wasn’t until it was, and in fact, in hindsight, it should have been obvious. Someone should have told me, “Dude, do you realize you’ve been doing this basically for free on the side as a hobby for more than a decade?” And by this I mean blogging, then writing books, MicroConf, which was essentially run at breakeven. It made a little bit of profit, but the podcast certainly didn’t take sponsorships, actually drew money. It feels like someone should have come along and told me, but eventually I did realize it right in the messy middle, I did this retreat and had this whole realization of like, oh, that’s where it is. And so is it only in hindsight that you can realize that you’ve been playing the right long game? I’m saying this to you as a listener. Are you thinking about what long game you’re playing? Whether it’s that fractal of I’m working on the SEO effort that’s going to pay off, or I’m working on this pivot or this move-up market, or am I thinking more about my career over the long term? What seeds are you planting today that can take you through for the next five, 10, or 20 years? What things would you prefer? What seeds would you prefer to be planting? Where do you want to be in that 10 or 20 years? And it’s a big question. It’s often hard to know. It’s that whole metaphor or the analogy. I forget which one of those it is, but it’s the airplane taking off from New York to LA, and making course adjustments along the way as you gather new information. That’s how I think about playing the long game, is you’re not going to know it at the start. And I don’t know that you… you could choose. I tell you what, consider yourself lucky if you choose the long game that you want to play. Because I don’t know that I did. It was more of like, eh, the people are blogging. I’m like, Paul Graham and Joel Spolsky are blogging. I’m going to start writing and see what happens and publish a blog. And I spent much time and it was super nerve-wracking. And eventually I took the next step. So I wasn’t choosing it along the way, but at a certain point I did realize, ooh, I really like this and this is fun, and I like this more than most of the other things in my professional career. And so, if you are very certain what long game you want to play, that’s awesome. Congratulations. I wish I was as lucky as you. It definitely took me many, many years to kind of realize that I was already playing a long game. I was in the middle of it, and I looked around and realized; oh, this is the one that I want to keep playing, right? It was really driven home for me in 2018. I will say that during those years though, really starting in probably 2002, 2003, I did start stacking skills. And when I think about playing a long game, I do think about are you acquiring new skills along the way, or are you stagnant? I’ve often used the metaphor of which tools do you have in your tool-belt? In marketing, it was like I learned SEO, and then I learned AdWords, and then I learned display ads. Is it a tool belt or a skill belt? Trademark 2024, Rob Walling. Which skills do you have in your skill belt? I hate that word already. I’m not going to be able to use it with a straight face. But you get the idea of… I was thinking back, things that I learned in order are the following hard work. I learned upfront that my parents taught me, “You’re not going to get anything without hard work.” So that was a skill that was instilled in me from time I was very young, and I’m glad they did. If you haven’t learned that yet, hopefully me saying it today convinces you of it. But then the next skill I learned really was web development. Two years out of school, out of graduating from… I went to public university in California, and then I learned how to hack together a UI and HTML by reading some books and some online tutorials, and then kind of launched some small efforts that didn’t do anything. And I learned how to blog. Five years after that, I then realized I needed to learn how to do conversion copywriting. I learned it from info marketers, but no one in the startup space was talking about it. And I realized in order to sell anything, I needed to know how to write copy to get people to click or buy or do whatever. So that was about a year later around the same time, how to structure a marketing website. I learned SEO. A year or two later, I started messing with pricing, because I had either built or acquired a couple products. I learned AdWords, then how to acquire small products, on and on, until… then, I started leveling up, right? Audience building, writing books, podcasting, in-person events and whatever it is I do today, just being on camera and such. All of this was me stacking more skills into that tool belt. And hard work, luck and skill. These are the three things. I can control hard work. I think most of us can. You put in more hours? Not to the point of being stupid, like a Silicon Valley startup, 90-hour weeks. That’s not what I mean, but you know what I mean. Focused, attention and just doing the work and putting in the time. Luck, much harder to control. Let’s just be honest. You can get luck, or you can’t. We can talk about making your own luck, luck surface area, yes, all that’s true, but that is the one you can least control. I think hard work’s probably the one you can most control, and then skills are in between. If I’m playing a long game, am I building skills and learning along the way and getting better at something? Like I just described that long series of things that I learned. Those all point towards me playing this game of building startups and then teaching others, encouraging others, educating others, and now investing in others who are doing the same thing. So I never could have guessed 20 years ago that this is where I’d end up. But I do think that as you’re going along on this journey, thinking about does my next step tie into my last step? Or am I just bouncing all over the place and not building new skills that relate to each other in a way that if I do look ahead five or 10 years, that I’ll be better off playing this game? All that to say 700 episodes of a podcast. When I get interviewed, people ask me, how have you done it? How have you never missed a week? And the answer is, I don’t know. I just kept recording. Once we were six months a year in, it was just a thing we did. And I know that’s not helpful, but I will say the feedback loop, what was helpful is there was a feedback loop. We didn’t just record into the void. We didn’t record a podcast over and over with no comments, no feedback, no listeners, no responses. There were signs along the way. The audience was becoming a thing. Hundreds of people after the first year, it wasn’t a lot, but I think we had maybe 600 listeners after the first year. And I had 25,000 RS subscribers at the time and a few thousand on my email list. And I was like, this is so not worth our time. But it was fun. I enjoyed it, and people were listening and that had an impact. And then at a certain point, it just became, especially in… I think there were several times between 2010 when we started this in 2018, where I thought just throwing in the towel and ending it. And I have never thought that since 2018, since having that big reckoning with this is what I do now. And I don’t think we should feel that way necessarily about companies we start. I think all of us exit, right? Everybody sells eventually. And I don’t think that we should be so attached… like starting a software company and then being that attached to it, I think see the talk from Dr. Sherry Walling a few years ago where she talks about how founders look at their logo and it stimulates the same part of their brain as when they look at pictures of their kids. So kind of literally lending credence to the idea of, oh, my startup is my baby. And it’s not super healthy. It leads to emotional entanglements that I think are not the best. But with a podcast or with something that I do think I’m going to do for a long time, am I going to sell the podcast? It’s not a SaaS app. So I think I’m able to manage that. It is more a reflection of me than I think a SaaS company should be for most founders. All that to say, thanks for being along on this journey. I almost didn’t record a special episode this week, because it just happens to be an episode with two zeros at the end. But I do feel like reflecting on progress and giving thoughts are warranted, and I think celebrating your victories… As much as I tell you to celebrate those victories, whether it’s on your own or whether it’s with that spouse or significant other who has been by you, your original investor, your first investor, as Sherry says, if I tell you to do it, then I need to do it too. And so here’s to 700 episodes of this podcast. Thank you so much for being along with me on the journey from the early days of Mike and I recording them together, to the transition that I thought might implode the podcast back in 2018, through the interviews, the solo episodes, the format changes, the audio quality changes, all manner of craziness. I really appreciate you sticking around. It means a lot to me. I wouldn’t keep recording if it didn’t impact people. These days, I don’t do things that I don’t think are impacting the broader entrepreneurial space and that are impacting folks like you. So thanks for being here this week and every week.

I’m your host this week and every week. This week I speak with Derrick Reimer. He’s a fan favorite guest on this show. He’s the founder of SavvyCal, what I call the best scheduling link on the internet. And today we answer a handful of listener questions from a single listener, a bit about UX design, how to prioritize and build features that scale. We talk at the end. There’s a bonus question about podcasting and just how to get better at that. All in all, it’s I think a really informative and casual conversation between Derrick Reimer and myself. Derrick and I have known each other for, I don’t know, 14 years or something. So these episodes flow very naturally and I feel like hopefully the content in this episode in thinking about product decisions and UX paradigms and just we relive some moments from building Drip as well. Hopefully these are inspirational as well as provide you with some actionable things that you can implement in your own entrepreneurial journey. Before we dive into that, tickets for MicroConf US in Atlanta next April 2024 are on sale. This event will sell out. If you’re thinking about coming to Atlanta, April 21st through the 23rd to see me co-host this event with Lianna Patch and to see speakers like myself, Rand Fishkin and several others, head to microcom.com/us to grab your ticket before they sell out. We had an amazing event just a few months ago in Denver, and I expect the event in Atlanta to be no different. So MicroConf.com/us to grab your ticket today. So with that, let’s dive right into my conversation. Derrick Reimer, thanks for joining me on The Startups For the Rest of Us.  Derrick Reimer:Thanks for having me back. It’s always a pleasure.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s good man. It’s good to catch up with you. I have several questions today from a longtime listener, Alan King. He’s a multi-time MicroConf attendee and he pinged me with some questions and eventually I said, “You know what? Just record them as audio. Derrick’s coming back on the show anyways, I like having him on.” So let’s talk through them. A lot of these are going to be around UX design, attacking different verticals stuff based on your experience and knowledge. So with that, let’s roll into our first question.  Allen King:Aloha Rob, Alan King here with funjoin.com. I’m a loyal listener, big evangelist and fellow Jedi Master in practice of course. What are the top three things that a senior UX designer needs to consider when scaling a product like Drip?  Rob Walling:So when Alan asks this, I think less about scaling throughput of billions of records and rows, I think as an app scales to many users with disparate experience and technology level or I think of even how do you scale this to different use cases. So how did Drip serve bloggers and SaaS founders and we had some media brands on it. We had e-comm, that’s a form of scaling. And even just functionality, if you know you’re going to become a complicated app or you kind of already are, how do you allow that to happen without having a terrible user experience. Salesforce, I’m looking at you. It’s like that kind of stuff where it’s just bloat and all that. How do you think about this and whether we do top three or whatever it is, what are the things that you’re thinking about? And I know the answer because you and I did this for years, but I’m fascinated to hear what you’re going to say.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, this is a big question and a really tricky one because as you mentioned, just as an example, something like a Salesforce, it’s really difficult and some of the most successful software products in the world in terms of revenue or market share actually do a pretty poor job at this and end up having to fall back on a lot of training or handholding or just at a certain point, a lot of these products end up having their own kind of university or training program with certified people to just help people wrap their minds around how to actually use the thing. So I mean part of this is there’s always going to be this tension of at a certain level of scale and complexity, you’re just going to find there’s more and more support burden and training and supplementary things that need to go along with it. But I still think it’s a worthy ideal to try to architect your product as well as you can so that people don’t feel like they have to constantly be reading the docs or asking support or whatever. So all that to say, I think a couple of things come to mind. I remember when we first hired our first outside designer besides me at Drip post-acquisition, one of the first things he did was starting to think about the design of the application more as a design system. I think before that point, each interface that we built was sort of an ad hoc thing. It was sort of its own creation. I think in the early days of building a product, that’s that’s how I’ve found things naturally happen. You don’t really know how the product’s going to take shape. What do the setting screens look like when there’s five pages of them and a bunch of different sections? I mean early on you usually have a page of settings and so you kind of start with just what you need to begin with and you design that interface ad hoc and then you realize, “Okay, I need to add another tab here and what are the pieces that are actually reusable?” So we’re not having to constantly rethink, “Okay, now we have a new setting section. How do we approach designing this? Are we using check boxes or toggles? Are we using native dropdowns? Do we have a custom dropdown that has more information stuffed into it?” And before you know it if you’re not thinking in terms of a design system, then you can end up with a hodgepodge of different choices that don’t really speak the same design language. So it can be kind of confusing and it could also be a lot of effort for your team to, if every single interface requires you to kind of think from the ground up. How this is going to look, what components you’re going to use, it just becomes really difficult to maintain, difficult to scale and costly because you’re doing a lot of repeat work. So something that, I mean a design system, I think it doesn’t necessarily have to be what you see some of the bigger companies or bigger startups doing. I think Airbnb is an example that they have a huge website that’s just all of their component libraries and everything is parameterized and it’s like they almost built their own custom library of stuff. I think other companies tend to do this. When you’re small, that’s way overkill. And I think we had something sort of that we could gradually build out. So I think he started with a single page, Brian, our first designer, started with a single page, let’s just standardize our buttons, form elements when we display a table, unless it’s a really, really custom thing, we can just use this standard design and banners and icons. So we just started to standardize these elements. It made the process of building new interfaces a lot quicker. So that’s probably my first thing.  Rob Walling:That’s solid gold advice right there. And it’s funny, because I had forgotten that. So I jotted notes of my own things and it’s super tactical things, but when he says top three pieces of advice that is, that’s the top three, to have some type of design language. And I remember because the way we got that far was you were the only designer and so everything you designed, you’re like, “I remembered I put it over on this page, copy paste.” But the moment we had two designers, that doesn’t work anymore because they don’t remember that you put the toggle over here, you had the multi-select or whatever. So that’s what it was his job to go through and look at all the work you did and say, “Let’s put it into this single kind of internal knowledge base thing.” If I remember, I don’t remember what the software was, but it was something, and like you said, it was pretty lightweight and it was built out as we went. That was something that you and I think for the betterment of everything, we were pretty resistant to heavy process and we’re not going to build out all these UI components, custom Drip dash whatever, right? Like we don’t have the bandwidth for that. Even with the team size, we did  Derrick Reimer:A couple kind of tactical things to add to this bullet point I think too, and these are things that I’m thinking about as I’m building SavvyCal. We’re still very small. I do most of the design work, but I am keeping in mind ideally I want my developer to be able to take a first crack at an interface and be able to pull things off the shelf that we already have designed and I may need to go through and do a design pass on it to make it kind of pixel perfect or whatever. But it’s similar to when you’re thinking about architecting a good code base for the user experience side of things. You can think about it similarly where you kind of abstract, you take pieces that are reusable and you’re not repeating yourself over and over again. So depending on what your front end technologies are, if you’re using React for example, then you can start to build out a directory of React components that are kind of generically named that you can use and those would hopefully bundle in kind of the style parameters that you’re using. I love Tailwind CSS. There’s a reason why it’s become so wickedly popular I think is because it gives you sort of the fundamentals for building out your own design system and it kind of eliminates, at a minimum, it gives you sort of units for putting margin and padding on things, which seems small, but being able to just say, “We always use a margin three to space elements out in a form”, it’s a lot better than making sure that you put margin 13 pixels or whatever it would end up being. You end up with some 12 pixels in there and some 16 pixels. And if you’re just making these little visual tweaks all the time, then you’re ending up with a lot of inconsistency. So things like utility styles like Tailwind CSS can help you constrain the number of choices you’re making all the time.  Rob Walling:Very nice. You want to dive into your number two?  Derrick Reimer:Sure. Number two, this is sort of a little bit amorphous, but thought about, it’s just understanding how customers are actually using the product. Because I think I find myself occasionally getting bitten by this where it’s like I hear a use case and I kind of know fundamentally what we need to accomplish, but it’s so easy to get the flow wrong where you realize the way that people are actually expecting to use this is they want to… I’ll just give an example. People will often say, “Okay, I’m going to share a scheduling link with somebody and I want to propose sometimes”, but they usually go through the process of wanting to maybe edit the link and then go preview it and then from the preview page go and propose times. And if I don’t have a propose times button on the preview page, then I’m requiring them to click back through to a different part of the application to get to that thing. So there’s these friction points that that’s not a huge deal, but they can start to add up over time to where people gain this perception that your software is clunky or the things that they’re expecting to be there are not in the place that they’re expecting them to be. And a lot of times these insights don’t come unless you’re actually trying to get this qualitative data from customers. And there’s a few different ways that I’ve seen people do this. We used to use Full Story I think was that software. I mean it’s a little dicey from a privacy perspective. I think there’s some things you can do to black out the screen to hide personal information or whatever, but we used to literally have a TV screen up in the office, remember this?  Rob Walling:Yup.  Derrick Reimer:And you could just walk by and watch customers actually step through the interfaces. And it was so fascinating to see when people would just get stuck on a page and the cursor would kind of move around and you could tell they’re confused and that kind of stuff is gold for figuring out what are the friction points, how can you make this more intuitive?  Rob Walling:I like that one a lot. And I think you had said before we hit record, you’re like, “Some of these feel like they might be obvious or they’ve been said before” and it’s like, yeah, kind of in different ways, but this stuff bears repeating. It’s that important. It’s like we as technical folks, I don’t even mean developers, I just mean product people who know how to use products. We have a very high ability to just learn stuff really quickly and most of our users do not unless you’re serving other product people. And it’s so easy to forget that my dad doesn’t know when I say, “What’s your web browser?” He’s like, “Do you mean my Firefox”? He doesn’t know what that term means, and he’s 80 years old. So that’s just the way it is and we can easily forget that we have the curse of knowledge. I want to piggyback on that a little bit with something that’s similar but different. It’s not exactly what you said, and I want to give an example and the thing I’m trying to communicate or my point here has also been said on this podcast, but it’s listen to your customer’s problems but not their solutions. So learning how they talk about it, what they’re actually trying to do, what are you trying to do with that? What are you actually trying to do with that? What’s the big picture you’re trying to do with that? Because usually they’re not even in the right neighborhood of the application to do what they want to do and they want you to add a checkbox and a dropdown on this page. You’re like, this makes no sense to me. But it turns out, oh, if we go to this settings page, we can add something. They’re completely different side if you actually know what they want to do. And I want to bring up the example. One of my favorite examples, Derrick. All right, so if you log into Drip or if you use any type of email marketing software where you have a sequence of emails, we used to call them campaigns. And so you have a table view and let’s say you have five or six emails in a row and it’s like one is welcome and then second is, Hey, you downloaded a sample chapter in my book and the third is what did you think of the sample chapter? And they’re sent days apart on a schedule, right? Pretty simple. It’s in a lot of piece of software. We used to get a lot of requests for people saying in between the first email and the second email, can you add a button or an option to where I can put an if then L statement? If they have this tag then I want to send them a different email or skip the next one in the sequence or add a label or just do something. Can you add a checkbox that allows me write in there? And it was always like, this is interesting. This person obviously has a problem, they have a problem, but their solution is catastrophic. As a product person because there’s no way. If we listen to their solution, it would’ve just been a spaghetti code mess or a visual… Talk about technical debt. Visual technical debt is brutal. It’s hard to solve. And we heard those for months and months and we were like, I don’t know what the solution is, maybe we should build one of these things. I don’t know. And you remember what the solution was after a year of hearing these? It was building workflows.  Derrick Reimer:Workflows, yeah.  Rob Walling:It was completely different paradigm. It was us saying, wait a minute, we need a visual builder where people can put a box on a thing that sends an email and then have a split and if then, this and that. It was a whole other feature and we still kept the campaigns in the table view as well, right? The sequence because a lot of people were like, it’s a clean view and if you’re just sending stuff in a certain order, it’s really nice to have that sequence actually embedded in a workflow. There were competitors of ours where if you wanted to send 10 emails a day apart, remember you were adding 10 different boxes to this visual. It was very cumbersome and ours was actually a more elegant solution. So that’s what I want to bring up. There’s just one example. If you listen to this podcast, you’ve definitely heard that paradigm before.  Derrick Reimer:And I think that’s especially applicable to what Alan’s describing here where I think he’s kind of getting at, he’s working on a product that serves a lot of different kind of use cases. So you’re going to hear, especially in this case where you’re pretty horizontal, you’re going to hear really strong opinions from customers phrased in the way that they’re used to solving the problem. And the trickiest part about building a horizontal product is that you’re trying to look for what’s the abstraction between these kinds of disparate requests that are sort of pointing to the same thing but they’re pointing to it in a different way and can we figure out a solution that sort of satisfies the verticals that we want to hit on, but without it being too specific to one where you end up with something that only applies to a small number of customers. And it’s hard, it’s very difficult, but that’s the challenge.  Rob Walling:So to wrap up this topic, I actually have two more tactical things maybe that I want to throw out. One is pay more attention to naming than you think you should. Just naming anything that appears in a top nav, any label on anything. You and I used to sit in front of that whiteboard at the first Bitwise building in Fresno and when we were building automations and tags and events and labels and custom feed, all that stuff, we wrote it all out, whiteboard, whiteboard, we were in there for hours saying, “Okay, first what are the paradigms? Let’s get our head around them, how technically what they’re going to do, what are they going to do in the UI? Just mentally, all right, I think that makes sense.” Name value pairs versus things with a date, that’s a custom field versus an event. And then we said, “What do we call these? What do we call them?” And we would, hours just agonizing we’ve got to brainstorm. Well, what does the rest of the industry call them? Do we want to be in line with that? If MailChimp calls them this thing and Infusionsoft, which is now called Keap, I believe if they call them this thing, what if that’s a really bad name? Infusionsoft named their stuff poorly and so a lot of times was just like, that’s not actually what this is, but they did it and so people thought that that name meant that thing and so we were trying to stay in line with them like tags. Okay, everybody knows what a tag is.  Derrick Reimer:I’m actually curious if you feel like, because that was something I remember, what was it like a campaign in MailChimp was actually a broadcast and we called them broadcasts and then our campaigns were sequences and theirs were called what autoresponders or something?  Rob Walling:Yep.  Derrick Reimer:And I remember there was friction around that. I actually don’t know the answer to this. Do you regret how we chose to originally name things or do you think is there wisdom in just staying in line with the bad industry names for certain things or is it worth fighting back and naming well?  Rob Walling:Here’s the thing, I think the advantage Alan has is I don’t think there’s a MailChimp or a Salesforce in his space. I don’t know of one, so he probably has more flexibility than we did naming. But to answer your question directly, I couldn’t have lived with myself if we called broadcast emails campaigns. That is not what that is. But it would’ve bothered me every day I logged in because I would’ve been like, “Yeah, so in order to have MailChimp people get an easier way when they start using our product, we did this.” Now with that said, have you logged into Drip lately? You go to campaigns and then there’s a dropdown list with I think three different things and there’s single email campaigns, email sequence campaigns, and I believe it’s like a website campaign, something like that. I’m messing up the naming, but you get the idea. They grouped them under that same thing, probably because MailChimp and others did it. So I don’t know, man, this is that hard part of you’re a product person, you’re so opinionated and taste, I want to really love what we build, but it’s the intention with industry norms, ease of onboarding, ease of support. That’s exactly what we’re saying here, right?  Derrick Reimer:Yeah.  Rob Walling:All right, last thing I want to chime in. This is so tactical, so we’ll go real quick on it. Hiding features. If you have features that people request and you’re like, “Boy, only one vertical uses this, or even this whole screen or this whole section”, you can build versions of your application that just hide a bunch of stuff from certain people or only show it to a certain, there’s a feature flag. There’s a flag on their record. If I had three verticals or four verticals I was serving that really were different, we had a lot of verticals using Drip, but we figured out a way to generalize everything. If I really needed the naming to be different and let’s say realtors have clients and so-and-so has customers, whatever. It’s naming of labels or of top nav stuff, I would consider having just a different type of account and this is a realtor account versus a brick and mortar account. I don’t know, we didn’t have to do it, but having that bit. But the example that I actually want to bring up of hiding features is the feature we didn’t want to build but people were requesting it. You know what I’m going to say. RSS to email, I hate that. Where it’s like, well I have this blog and I’m publishing stuff anyway and I want an email to go out for each one. And it’s like that’s not a very good way to do email marketing, but a bunch of people wanted it, so we built it and only the people that had requested it, we checked checkbox and they saw it. And then over the course of years and we had a KB article about it, I think by the time we left 50 people had access to it out of tens of thousands of users.  Derrick Reimer:It was such an interesting one because yeah, if the demand had been lukewarm, we probably would’ve just said, “Sorry, we don’t have it.” But I feel like at the time, maybe it was like AWeber or one of those kind of older school ones, everybody who was using that publishing workflow relied on the RSS to email and it was just a hard blocker for them.  Rob Walling:Yep, for them to switch.  Derrick Reimer:I actually don’t know, maybe people are still using that, but I feel like RSS has sort of become less integral to the publishing workflow and now there’s Ghost and there’s the email sending platforms are trying to become more of the publishing platform also. So the trends have shifted and yeah, there probably still remains a small contingent of people who love that magical feature that just automatically sends emails when the RSS feed updates, but it was a real nightmare to maintain. q  Rob Walling:It was a pain. And so you might ask, “Well why did you build it then?” And it’s exactly what you said. We were literally losing deals over just that and they were significant deals. They were hundreds of dollars a month, obviously thousands of dollars in ACV at a time when we were, I think we built it when we were 20 to 30K MRR and I knew that there were thousands of dollars of MRR, at least a few thousand that we could get with it. And so it became that I don’t want to build this, but I am going to grit my teeth and build this, but I’m going to hide it just to try it. I just don’t don’t want to support it for what wound up being thousands, tens of thousands of people. I don’t want to promote it as a good email marketing practice. Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

I will be honest upfront, I wouldn’t add multiple products unless I really, really, really needed to. I would hold off. This is that thing of translating my product into other languages, into Spanish and German. It’s just usually, can’t I just find more customers of this type? Have I maxed out the entire market? And I find that folks who want to launch additional products, it’s just so much more work than you think it is. So that’s kind of a blanket thing. I’m not saying don’t ever do it and we can still answer the question, but that’s kind of my overall opinion on this topic.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think as we riff on this we can maybe come to some thoughts about how to do this well, but I agree that it sounds like he already acknowledges that it’s really difficult to serve a lot of different verticals and keep everybody happy at the same time. So my gut is just from a strategic standpoint as he’s thinking about, all right, we’re continuing to grow the business, we work really well for a bunch of these people. I’m sure he is finding some of these market segments are just, the customer type is just not the type that he wants to serve, hopefully. Hopefully he has some clarity around that even though they’re making it work, does it feel like you’re fighting against, they’re constantly kind of dissatisfied to the point where the way you want to take the product and the vision you have for it just doesn’t really seem to overlap with what this one particular use case is? Then I would urge you to consider just narrowing away from that and trying to identify who are the few, and hopefully you can find enough commonality between their use cases that you can have a roadmap that is generally speaking to the needs for all of those segments. So those are my initial thoughts on just narrowing focus a bit.  Rob Walling:Yeah, narrowing focus I think is what I would try to do as much as possible and to not serve. I mean by the time, again, if you’re serving four or five verticals but it’s all within the same app and generalizable, that’s fine, but it’s when you start, you have 10 different kind of use cases and you really need 10 different apps or this component. I think of HubSpot with modules and Salesforce and modules that you add on and remove. And maybe that’s the answer is that there truly, I was talking about having account types earlier that just hide and show stuff automatically, but that can easily turn into a paid add-on for this extra module and that’s a pattern that we see with enterprise software. To me it just feels complicated when you’re early, that feels complicated. I don’t see most companies below seven figure ARR trying to do that. And is that a sign that either you’re trying to do too much, you’re taking just a little too big of a bite at the apple or you’re not saying no to enough things? And just being like, “You know what, we have one customer type or two or three that work and unfortunately we’re just not going to serve this other market.” I don’t know, without more information. I obviously can’t give specific advice, but it’s an unusual pattern. There’s a little yellow flag for me if you’re trying to solve the problem in the way that you’re describing it where it’s like I want all these modules. And again, I’m assuming Alan’s early stage, we don’t know his revenue.  Derrick Reimer:I think what we kind of touched on earlier where if the main difference is just nomenclature for example, then that feels like something that’s solvable. Even if it’s like, I’ve seen products do this, I think Stripe does this with their checkout product where it’s like do you want the confirmation button to say purchase product or should it be subscribe or should it be, they have different ways to customize what the fulfillment button says to indicate the type of thing. It’s something we’ve considered with SavvyCal. We generally refer to things as meetings, but that’s not always the intention. It’s not always a meeting. Maybe think of it more like a session or I don’t know. There’s just different kind of ways to identify the thing and if that’s really the main difference, but all the other mechanics are the same, then that seems reasonable to try to figure out a way to allow that level of customization. But to just give another example, that’s something that we bump up against. We have a certain type of customer that loves our core functionality, but then they want this whole sort of buy a pack of time slots and then you can eat away at your balance of credits that you’ve purchased for a certain number of meetings and maybe you want those recurring and it starts to just spider out into this whole separate thing. It’s not something I’m necessarily opposed to doing, but that sort of thing we’ve really been careful in gathering customer requests and insights and really thinking hard about it. Can we see a world where it makes sense to add this onto the existing product? In some ways it almost feels like a completely separate product or a completely separate module where it’s like, okay, now you basically have sort of a commerce tab of some kind where you’re storing a lot of information about customers who have bought a certain number of time slots and now you need to manage state around that. So it’s a huge kind of build out that we’re very hesitant to do unless we feel like we can actually be competitive in that area and it won’t wreck the user experience for the rest of the product, which is a big consideration. You don’t have to feel like, it’s easy to get to the place where you used to be the simple elegant solution and now people start saying, “Well, it’s sure feeling complicated over there” and you never want to get to that place if you can at all help it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and that’s where I think, I like that example you brought up because I think of Squarespace, which started off as a website builder, but now Squarespace Commerce is a big thing and it’s a decent shopping cart. It’s not the most sophisticated, but I use it to sell the SaaS playbook. So SaaSplaybook.com is hosted on Squarespace, and then I have other sites that don’t have commerce built in. And there’s a selling thing in the left nav, and if I click it and I don’t have the commerce, it just says, “Oh, you could sell stuff if you wanted, click here to upgrade. And if I have a cart and I have sales and I click in, it’s my whole dashboard. And you could easily make it that if I didn’t have selling, it just didn’t appear in the left now. That’d be the thing is how modular can you make this and I mean it goes without saying, keeping consistent UI and UX paradigms per the first thing to do.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I actually have one other thought that just occurred to me too. If you already have some existing patterns on how you build external integrations with other platforms. I don’t know if Alan has any of those at this point. I’m sure he does with calendars or whatever. So you think about how you generally build those into your product. In SavvyCal for example, we have on links, we have sort of a little automation or integrations area and you can basically install an external app. So if you want to send booking information over to HubSpot, you can click a little dropdown, say add an integration and then send contacts to HubSpot. And you install that and there’s a little bit of configuration, choose your account, connect to your HubSpot account or whatever. And now you have this sort of modular connection between a scheduling link and your CRM. And it is interesting to think about can you apply those similar patterns, similar ways you would think about integrating with external products, but do that with your own internal modules as well? And I think there’s a lot of patterns you can sort, even though I think you wouldn’t want a whole separate app that you log into. Ideally it would be a module of some kind inside of your core monolithic application, but can you treat it as you would almost an external integration if it’s separated enough?  Rob Walling:I think that’s a very elegant way to think about it. All right, let’s dive into Alan’s third and final question, but he actually sent me a relevant super bonus question that maybe if we have time, we’ll answer at the end.  Allen King:Lastly, does Derrick Reimer have any processes that he’d like to share for creating articles, change logs and updating content when it becomes dated? I’m a big fan of his knowledge base and his SavvyCal product as a whole. I love the work you both did on Drip and I’m very grateful for all the work you’ve done for our community. Looking forward to MicroConf this year. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Aloha from Hawaii. Peace, see you soon.  Derrick Reimer:So I use Help Scout’s knowledge base feature, which is pretty nice because it integrates deeply with their Beacon widget. So when someone clicks the help tab in SavvyCal, it opens the beacon and they can start to type a question and we can surface knowledge base articles to them. And if those don’t satisfy their question, then they can send an email to us. So that kind of integration is pretty nice. I think Alan’s using Intercom maybe, and I think they have a very similar type of thing. I took a peek at Alan’s knowledge base. It looks like you’re off to a really good start on that. But yeah, we generally, when building any feature of substance that’s not a tiny thing, I usually default to wanting to publish some kind of knowledge base article, something very specific to the feature. And the title is usually something, it’s not like I’m trying to describe an entire subsystem in one article. We keep them pretty granular, almost phrased like the answer to a question if someone was asking the question. And for most projects we just drop a ticket in the project management system for that. So the project’s not considered done until we have a little KB article. And I also have, speaking of component libraries, like a lot of the settings sections that we have, we just default to having a little info icon in the product that requires a URL to a KB article. So it’s a good forcing function for us to make sure that we have somewhere to send them if they were to click the info icon to learn more about the feature. And I also like to, I use Headway for our change log and we have a little widget in the app. It’s that standard pattern when there’s something new, it’s like a little red dot with a number on it and you can click it and it shows the little top five things in the change log. And that’s just a helpful way to surface new stuff. I mean, it’s hard to keep new customers abreast of features and also existing customers who aren’t necessarily receiving onboarding sequences and things, it’s hard to keep them aware of new stuff happening. So I feel like that’s a good touch point for sure. And similar to the KB articles, we generally as part of the launch plan for any feature, bias towards just dropping something in the change log. And I try to keep those really, really concise, like one or two sentences and I have a little template, so I usually try to include a screenshot, something that represents the feature. And yeah, it’s not a huge burden because we plan on keeping those short. Try to speak to how this improves the customer’s life. So describe the functionality of the feature and also why they should care. And just a couple sentences and yeah, that’s just kind of integrated into our process.  Rob Walling:Ladies and gentlemen, a masterclass in how to maintain your KB. Thank you, sir, we should record that, sell it as a course. It’s just a really good thorough answer. Very concise.  Derrick Reimer:And I think another note on keeping things up to date, I mean is that’s hard. I think there’s probably some stuff in our knowledge base that’s a little bit outdated and if it’s just small changes to the UI, I don’t think it is a huge stumbling block. So we are not necessarily keeping on top of every single screenshot to make sure it looks identical to the current UI. But what we do is empower support agents to make any changes to the knowledge base at any time. So if they are sharing a KB article, which we often do in support, we’ll explain how something works, but then we’ll also include a link to the knowledge base article. It usually has just a little bit more expansive detail than the specific response. I think our support guys are used to looking at the knowledge base article to make sure it’s relevant and if they notice something that’s out of date, they’re spending a lot of time in the product helping diagnose things for customers or explain things. So they usually will spot if something’s out of date and they can just grab a new screenshot. I like to use CleanShot, but there’s a bunch of different apps that’ll do that. That basically lets you take a screenshot and draw an arrow. That’s the default way that we do stuff. Put arrows on product screenshots, and those are really easy to replace. Things that are a lot harder is like if you have videos that have a lot of shots of the product, there’s a much higher cost to updating those. For that reason, we generally skew towards text and images, which are easier to update.  Rob Walling:In the early days, getting a loom or equivalent recorded for your support or for your KB is way faster to do. Over time, it is essentially a type of debt, video debt, documentation debt. We did that with Drip in the early days, right? Instead of writing a long KB article, I just recorded a video and it was great and it got us going, and then we had to go back and redo. Basically I paid someone to redo all those and basically turn the videos into written. And that’s why most KBs are written because the video is just hard to maintain. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it, just know that you’re going to run into some issues down the line. I like what you pointed out about keeping things up to date that you kind of do the best you can because even again, when we left Drip, it was doing tens of millions a year with tens of thousands of customers and there was still stuff that was, it just gets out of date and you just don’t pick it up. So it’s one thing I would, you do your best and just know that there’s going to be stuff that’s out of date at any, it’s not going to be perfect and it doesn’t need to be, and you can still be wildly successful. All right, you want to take a crack at this fourth super bonus question about podcasting? I love talking about podcasting. Yeah.  Derrick Reimer:Oh, sure.  Rob Walling:His question is what magical wizardry secrets or dark, scary, painful pitfalls would you give to your virgin podcast selves before you got started actually podcasting? I have a couple of things that come to mind. One is, fewer people are going to listen to you or care about your podcast than you think, especially in the early days. And that’s a good thing because you’re not going to be very good when you start. I’m talking to me, by the way. Just to be clear, me 14 years ago, it’s just not, you can go back and listen to the first five episodes of this show. They’re not very good. We don’t have the energy, we’re not concise enough, there’s just a bunch of things wrong with it. The audio quality isn’t very good, et cetera, et cetera. And that’s okay because I put in the reps and eventually you get better. So fewer people listen to you in the early days. I stressed about it in the early days. “I’m on the mic, I’m so nervous, oh my God.” We’re all going to be nervous. It’s fine, realize that fewer people listen to you, and hopefully it helps you just be more of yourself. Second thing I want to say is the only way I know to get better at it, some people are naturally good at it. I will give them the first time they get on the mic. They’re amazing. Most people that I know are not, the only way I know to get better is to practice. It’s just to do a bunch of reps. And again, if you go back and listen to the show by the 10th or 15th episode, it’s like, “Oh, that’s not terrible.” By the 30th it’s like, “Ooh, these guys kind of know what they’re doing.” Practice and listening to other podcasters, I would say both because just doing the same thing over and over doesn’t make you better. But I would listen to other podcasts and say, “Ooh, this is very entertaining. All of a sudden, why am I entertained by this? Can I do that? Does it fit to adapt that approach to my show?” So practice and developing taste of what a good podcast is, I think is a thing. The third one that took me a very long time. In fact, if you go back even, I don’t know how many years, but you go back six or seven years, I still wasn’t doing this until again a few years back. But it’s to have just a little more energy than you naturally would. Like if you and I, Derrick were on this call and just talking about SavvyCal strategy or talking about Dungeons and Dragons and the nat 20 that Darren rolled last night on his persuasion check, we would just be talking and having fun. Somehow, when you do that and talk naturally, you sound subdued and with low energy. It’s just this weird thing that cameras and microphones do. And so now at this point, I naturally switch when I’m in front of a microphone, I talk just a little bit different than again, if you and I were hanging out. And it’s just a one notch above in energy. That was a very difficult and painful thing for me to, it was felt very unnatural, like I was faking it, like I was not being me, like I was being hyped. Why am I acting like this person who’s excited when I’m not actually excited when I say, “Welcome back to Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m your host, Rob Walling.” That’s how I say it now. But when I say it, I’m like, “Oh, that feels weird.” When I listen back, I’m like, “That’s a good intro.” And when I listened back to intros from 10 years ago, I’m like, “That intro sucks. It’s boring.” So there’s something about energy and learning how to channel it in a way that feels authentic. To me, I am not on this mic if I’m not being me and trying to be authentic, but you have to be a little more energetic than I think you would naturally.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, I think because I’ve heard people go too far in that direction where it’s like, “Hey, I’m trying to have a radio voice”, and they talk that way the whole time and it’s like, “Ooh, that’s too much. That’s too much.”  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s terrible. It’s not authentic.  Derrick Reimer:So it’s the authenticity piece. And I think, yeah, it does take practice to figure out how to do that. I mean, I don’t know any other way other than reps and listening back to yourself. I was a very reluctant podcaster from day one. I mean, Ben Ornstein can attest to this, that he basically had to pull teeth to get me to agree to just first start guesting with him. And then he was like, “You want to kind of do this for the foreseeable future?” And I was very hesitant because I didn’t feel like I had a natural knack for it. I didn’t think I sounded smart or funny on audio. It took a lot of getting past my own barriers, and it helped to start to hear from people like, “Hey, I really enjoyed, that was great.” And I was still not convinced for a long time that it was any good, but I just kind of persisted through it. I think this is sort of a hack, is having a co-host that you have good rapport with. Is it the kind of person you could just have a 30-minute-long phone conversation with and it would feel pretty natural, or is it stilted? Because if you can’t have a normal conversation, it’s going to be hard to have a good podcast recording together. Because a lot of times podcasts, especially interviews and even more conversational ones, they often end up being kind of like, I talk for a while, then I mute, and then you talk for a while, and then you mute. And I have found trying to steer it more towards feeling like a conversation, even if I’m responding with uh-huhs and things, that can all be cut in editing, so you don’t have to keep all the kind of conversational connective tissue in place. But I find that the more I do that in the course of a conversation over a podcast, the more authentic the edited version feels. And to that point, good editing. I would say, if you’re wanting to seriously produce a podcast, have an editor edit out the awkward pauses and things, because that makes a huge difference. I’ve listened to the unedited version of a podcast I’ve done, and then the edited versions, and it’s way better with good editing.  Rob Walling:That one didn’t even occur to me because editing is just something we’ve done from day one. And you used to edit a lot heavier in terms of cutting out ums and ahs. There are just a lot fewer ums and ahs these days. You do it long enough and you stop doing that. I want to revisit something that you touched on that is something I do and hadn’t occurred to me that I would need to say it, but I call it game tape. When I used to play football, ran track, we would watch tape of ourselves. This tape, it was, yes, it was on a video recorder of some sort. It was before digital. It was the nineties people. But we watched game tape and be like, “Ooh, yeah, I shouldn’t have done that. Oh, I could get better doing this.” To me, I’ve listened to every episode of every podcast I’ve ever recorded, even the interviews, as far as I know, as long as if people let me know that it went live, I go and listen to it. And I don’t do it as some ego thing or to say, “Ooh, aren’t I smart?” I actually listened to it to say, “Huh, I should have communicated that better.” Or, “They asked me a question that I didn’t know the answer to, and I can feel myself kind of vamping and I eventually usually get to something. But the first 60 seconds of that was a non-answer, so I’m going to do better next time.” And the other thing for me is I will listen back and be like, that was a really interesting framework that it just occurred to me on the show. I said it once, I never said it again. And it’s like, that should be in a book or that should be revisited on the podcast. I’ll actually pull nuggets out of old conversations that just happen to be on tape. And so listening to game tape, I think the number one reason is to get better. And you’re going to cringe the first few times for sure, but then you’re going to realize, “Okay, so I say um too much. How do I work on saying um less?”  Derrick Reimer:Yep. And something that I discovered too is that I would often leave a recording session feeling like that was terrible. And then I would go back and listen. And I usually had some takeaways on things to improve, like you just described, but I also usually came away with the feeling that that was not nearly as bad as I thought it was. And that was a reinforcing thing of, you know what, yeah, you’re not going to be perfect at it. Nobody is, but this is not as bad as your brain was telling yourself that it was.  Rob Walling:That’s a really good point. I agree with you there. Any TinySeed founder that comes on this show, I kind of force them in a nice way. I say, you need to listen to this interview because, and the reason I only do it for TinySeed founders is I feel like I have some sway over there. You know what I mean? Or some input into how they operate professionally. And so I’m sure not all of them do, but I really, really encourage people to do it, to listen to the interview, just to be like, oh, that part was good and that part was bad. And try to evaluate it and be honest. And of course, you cringe a little bit, but that’s how you get better.  Derrick Reimer:And to tie it back home too, the same applies for your product. Watching people use your product, you’re going to learn a ton, and it’s one of the most painful things you can ever do.  Rob Walling:That’s so painful. Dude. No doubt. Thanks for those questions, Alan. I hope, yeah, I hope our answers were helpful to you in your entrepreneurial journey. If you’re smart and you’re like Alan, then you’re coming to MicroConf in Atlanta here in just a couple months. It’s April 21st through the 23rd, and tickets are actually going pretty fast right now, and this will sell out. I don’t know when, I don’t know what month it’ll be, but if you’re considering it, you want to head to MicroConf.com and pick up your ticket. I’m speaking, Rand Fishkin, Asia Orangio. Lianna Patch is co-MCing with me, and I think we have another super special guest that Xander’s waiting to announce. So yeah, grab your tickets. And Derrick Reimer sir, thanks so much for taking the time today.  Derrick Reimer:Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Dropping mad knowledge. Folks want to keep up with you and they want to see the best scheduling link on the internet, they can go to SavvyCal.com and of course, follow you on Twitter @DerrickReimer.  Derrick Reimer:Indeed.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Derrick for coming on the show. It’s always great to have him and hang out for 30 or 40 minutes. I hope this 30 or 40 minutes has provided you with some tactic or strategy or maybe some inspiration to think about building and growing your business this week. I’ll be back in your ears again next Tuesday.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and in this episode I sit down with Noah Kagan. He has launched, I forget the number, I think he says it in the interview, but five, seven-figure companies, it might be six, it’s a lot. And he has written a book called The Million Dollar Weekend. The book is available now in all formats, head to milliondollarweekend.com if you want to learn more. Before we dive into that, tickets for MicroConf US in Atlanta next April 2024 are on sale. This event will sell out. If you’re thinking about coming to Atlanta April 21st through the 23rd to see me co-host this event with Lianna Patch and to see speakers like myself, Rand Fishkin and several others, head to microconf.com/us to grab your ticket before they sell out. We had an amazing event just a few months ago in Denver and I expect the event in Atlanta to be no different. So, microconf.com/us to grab your ticket today. And with that, let’s dive right into my conversation with Noah. We’re actually going to join it mid-conversation. He and I had been chatting for, I don’t know, four or five minutes and I realized it was good content so I just hit record and we rolled right into it.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, we can talk about that. I don’t think people give enough thought to good decisions over long periods of time.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Noah Kagan:Consistent. You can make a good decision once but then, if you have to do that in competitive landscapes over 10-year periods or longer, that’s challenging, man, it’s tough.  Rob Walling:There’s this quote from Steve Martin where he used to go see comedians, he has a great book called Life Standing Up, Born Standing Up.  Noah Kagan:It’s so good.  Rob Walling:Yeah, love it. And my favorite quote from there is it’s easy to be great, it’s hard to be consistent. Because he would come and see a comedian just blow the doors off one night and then, next month, they would just bomb for the next month. And he was like, “The hard part was getting good enough that he could consistently be amazing.” And I think that’s what you’re talking about, right?  Noah Kagan:Well, that’s what we were doing with sumo.com even. That went from zero to six and a half million ARR in maybe two years or three years. Super quick.  Rob Walling:Was it just email capture?  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Was it the widget?  Noah Kagan:So, the original idea-  Rob Walling:What was the product?  Noah Kagan:The original premise was appsumo.com has no MRR, ARR stuff, we want to try to have something recurring, what have we built for ourselves that we can sell to others. And so, the original vision for my partner, Chad, his idea was we should build the WordPress plugin store for websites. So, you can put in one plugin and you can have all the marketing tools you’ll need and then the idea is can we launch tools within two to four weeks and we launched a highlighter tool. We basically tried to go to any of the largest businesses and I think this is a good way to do business today. It’s like, “What are you spending a lot of money on? Can you automate that or create software on it?” So, we went to New York Times and all these giant websites and they had these different features like a highlighter and then email collection and we’re like, “Huh, we’re doing a lot of email collection,” and then we launched the popup called the email capture and it just exploded. The demand was so easy at that time.  Rob Walling:I remember this. This was back when Drip was just email capture, right? Drip was the first, all it was was an email capture widget and auto responders. And then we … That was 2013 and it wasn’t until 2014 that we actually became a competitor to Mailchimp. And Sumo was around that time, wasn’t it?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, it was SumoMe and then we bought the domain after seven years for a million and a half and then we launched so many different things. We had a heat map and then we had scroll boxes and then we had, I don’t know, a lot of different analytics around the plugin and it’s interesting in business. I think what ends up happening in most businesses, they try all these new things and then, over time, they’re like, “Oh, I should just do the thing that people really wanted me for.” They do all these things and, really, at the end of the day, it was just capture emails for small businesses or solopreneurs and Mailmunch kicked our ass with that because they were 20 bucks and OptinMonster and they did WordPress. And then we got, as you were talking about your business, we got our asses kicked because we tried to then do mid-market and then we try to do e-commerce. I think it’s really hard to stay consistent and just do the thing well that’s working. And that’s something I’ve definitely learned over, I guess, now 15, 20 years of startups.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I have too. Tell me about sumo.com, I had no idea you sold it. Is that public info?  Noah Kagan:It’s not public yet.  Rob Walling:Okay.  Noah Kagan:We just closed … When did we close? Maybe two weeks ago. This podcast, by the time it comes out, I’m thinking it’ll be public. Man, I was really disappointed in myself and I was really sad just how badly I ruined it.  Rob Walling:What happened?  Noah Kagan:Well, first, when you get a product that works, you know. People are like, “How do you know if you have product market fit?” You know. You don’t have to ask people to buy.  Rob Walling:100%. You don’t need to send a survey out about would you be not wanting to, you see the graphs. I’ve been there, dude, you’re like, “This is a rocket ship.”  Noah Kagan:Yeah, people are excited to pay you for a problem that you can clearly demonstrate value. Now, we launched the product and then things just worked and I think one of the key things that helped it worked is that the first year we were just free so we just had this insane install base. So, then we said, “Hey, pay 20 bucks a month,” it just crushed.  Rob Walling:I remember that. You had your JavaScript snippet on hundreds of thousands-  Noah Kagan:Every site.  Rob Walling:… of sites, I thought it was crazy.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, it was about a billion users a year so far is what we ended up getting it across the websites. But the mistake, I think, the learnings for others which is fascinating was deviating from who our core customer is. That’s probably the number one mistake we made which was we got to the six point a half million and then you’re like, “Well, I got to get bigger,” and it’s like, “Why?” “Because that’s what you’re supposed to do.” So, then we raise the prices from 20 bucks a month to a hundred to 500 to thousands because then we went upmarket. And then we’re like, “Well, Shopify’s getting bigger, let’s go over there. We can go help these customers.” And really, appsumo.com and our core customer is the solopreneur, that’s probably more of a blogger, an agency, a marketer, we’re not e-commerce people, that’s not our customer base. And so, ultimately, if we just would’ve stayed on that price point and that customer, it could be a $20 million ARR, maybe more in that space. And so, I think that was one. And then, secondly, me and my partner just had disagreement in visions and my approach to that or my response to that was to run away a little B. I just ran away from it versus, hey, let’s agree on what we really want to do here. And so, I call it the seagull theory, I basically was like … He wanted to go mid-market and e-comm and I was like, “I just like affordable products. That’s why we have appsumo.com, I like good deals. $20 a month, good price.” And we just disagreed on it and we could not get to the same page so I ran away and built SendFox and some other tools but I did the seagull theory or seagull mentality where I just flew over their team and I (beep) on them and complained about things and then flew away. And we all do that and it’s more how do you get aligned with your visions and then how do you actually be … Are you here to help or complain? If you’re complaining, just sit the (beep) out. Ideally, if you’re going to go be a part of it, go and be a part of the solution. So, that’s definitely been something to … What’s the heart? There’s a quote I like which is what’s the thing unsaid and say that and then work through those things.  Rob Walling:And so, did the business decline? You sold it, was it like, “We got it, we’re just going to walk away.”? Did it decline?  Noah Kagan:Oh, dude. So, we peaked at six and a half million and we were getting offers, I think, around 30 million. I think we’ve had a $30 million offer and I was like, “That would’ve been real nice, I would love to fly private.” And my goal was, by 50, to only fly private if I can, God willing. And it just started declining and you just … I’m sure other people who have companies feel this way, we tried everything. You’re like, “Okay, try to optimize pricing more, call all these customers,” and, because we were competing against so many bases, so many different competitors, we were just losing against all of them because they were either better at WordPress, better at mid-market or better over at Shopify and e-commerce. So, what we ended up doing was skeleton crew that software and just let it cash out over the next, probably, five years because it was still doing, what was it doing, it was two or 3 million a year and declining over years. And so, only until recently, we saw that the revenue to the server cost was getting close enough that we’re like, “It’s becoming a liability and maybe someone can do something with this.” So, it was an interesting experience selling it because it makes you face your mistakes and I do think it’s interesting, what are people’s intentions. Because I didn’t build AppSumo to sell it, I didn’t build AppSumo to go public, I don’t need that ego, I don’t want that money, I want to have a cool job, that’s it. And with Sumo, I think it was more just disappointing, really. Yeah, you can tell. I’m like, “Ah, it’s so frustrating,” I know, all of us have felt that and so we went out to different brokers. The selling process is really interesting, there’s a lot of different types of buyers. There’s these vulture buyers who are just actually really savvy, frankly. They’re really savvy and they’re totally-  Rob Walling:Yeah, value buyers.  Noah Kagan:They’re value buyers and it takes a long time to sell. You see these articles or tweets, yeah, I sold my thing two minutes, da, da, da on acquire.com or through Quiet Light Brokerage, it doesn’t happen that way. So, you put out a prospectus, you have to get your finances actually really up to date, which we didn’t do because we haven’t really touched that business in probably five years which was nice to cash out, but I’d say the bigger takeaway was how do you actually find someone more strategic. So, we were able to find, I don’t know if they want to be public yet, but a Wix, wordpress.com business that’s doing really well and they wanted email marketing and marketing tools. And what was really impressive about these guys, and maybe by the time they want to be public with it, they’re very patient. They’re like, “Yeah, we’ve been doing our SaaS business for 20 years and we are okay if this takes another 20 years for it to get SumoMe,” it’s what it’s called, “Back up.” And then the strategic buy, yeah, they were willing to pay, I think it was around one X ARR for the business.  Rob Walling:Okay. And it was a declining, basically, flatlined business at the time.  Noah Kagan:It’s still declining. It’s declining, give or take, one to 3% a month. So, I think we’re … I don’t know, I don’t want to share their number, now it’s their numbers but, yeah, it was declining. So, it was a seven figure sale which, to me, it was just sad, it was just sad. The promise of what it was, what it could have been and, ideally, we learn from those mistakes but it still hurts.  Rob Walling:It does. It feels like almost snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in a way. Because, when you launched, I remember how many people had that JavaScript installed and I thought, because we were tangentially competitive with Drip because we were an email capture widget as well, but then we pivoted into becoming a full-blown email marketing provider. But I remember being like, “He’s going to do it, this is great. There’s no way he can’t be successful with this.” And in fact, you were successful with it because, six and a half million, $30 million offer, is amazing, it’s what everybody would dream about. But it’s harder than people think. Even with momentum, even with good people, even with a smart founder, it’s hard to run a tech company for 10 or 20 years and not just ride it over the top.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, I think it’s that and being patient with the plateaus. Everyone hits plateaus. At AppSumo, appsumo.com, another product market fit … And to be clear, I’ve done a lot of business that did not work. With AppSumo, we build, we call them the originals, and I was telling you, tidycal.com, our Calendly alternative is crushing, it’s five X growth this year. And that’s one of about 10 products that we’ve launched on the original team. ShortySMS, fail, EmailBadge, fail, MeetFam, fail, SumoMarket, fail, all these different things that did not work. And that’s part of the business is that you got to keep experimenting. But AppSumo, my point that I was saying, with sumo.com, we launched 300,000 first year, second year, 3 million, third year, 4 million and then it was basically three to 5 million for the next three years and then this year it’ll be around 80 million, 13 years later. And there’s numerous facets to that but I think the big takeaway for others, make sure people super want what you have, stick with your customer. So, whoever the customer is, just stick with them and understand them. And I would say, with sumo.com, for others, what was interesting how we grew so fast, one … You know we bought a lot of WordPress plugins?  Rob Walling:I did know that.  Noah Kagan:That was probably one of our biggest hacks because you could buy … So, the idea is buy WordPress plugin and then promote Sumo but the takeaway there is what’s something that others aren’t doing that’s cheap or unexploited that you can take advantage of to get distribution to your ideal customer base. That was probably the biggest one and then personally reaching out, what you did, what ConvertKit did. We’d go to Tim, we’d go to Pat Flynn and be like, “We’ll do everything for you, you don’t have to do anything,” which became … It’s a little bit of the norm now in some of the SaaS.  Rob Walling:Yeah, but it was novel 10 years ago. And I think … What was the other thing you did? With AppSumo specific, I remember you sponsoring email newsletters before there were really sponsors of email newsletters. Right?  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:I remember you being in some random newsletter and someone’s like, “Oh yeah, Noah offered me 500 bucks to post this here,” and I’m like, “This guy knows what he’s doing, man.”  Noah Kagan:That strategy, to be clear, and that’s something everyone go … Well, don’t compete with us but copy it in your respective areas but we still do that day, it’s the prefluencer strategy. And so, we do it at AppSumo, we have a team of five now dedicated to video ambassadors. And so, the idea is we go out, we give them a flat fee and then a percent of their sales. And ideally, you don’t want to go to people … I have a million subs on YouTube and I have a relatively sizable audience, don’t go to me, go to the person whose audience is hyper engaged on a really tight subject. And even if you want to be even more creative, go to different languages. So, we have people crushing it in Spanish, crushing it in Portuguese. And when we want to do things now, we have a hundred and then, by next year, maybe a thousand people that can be doing this. We did the same thing with sumo.com, I did the same thing at mint.com, we did the same thing with appsumo.com. That strategy works because, when you’re going to Facebook or Google Ads, you’re paying market rate and you want to figure out how to not pay market rate. So, a lot of these smaller people have much more affordable pricing for very unique and great promotion to the right audience.  Rob Walling:So, I want to talk about AppSumo a little more, I want to talk about YouTube, I want to talk about your book. So, for folks who are listening or watching, Million Dollar Weekend, it’s mdwbook.com, that’ll take you to … That’s currently taking you to the Amazon page, is that what it’s going to do?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, we did buy so by the time this episode comes out. You can go to milliondollarweekend.com and take the 48-hour challenge to change your life. We’ll get into that, we’ll get into that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, yeah, we’ll do it. We’re talking about AppSumo. So, I want to find out, because from the outside, I remember when you started it, I remember you did your first bundle back when you were doing bundles and 20% of the deals came from micropreneur.com, a referral link in a forum and so you reached out to me, we did a phone call. I remember I was standing out by my swimming pool, 2010, ’09, ’10, had to have been around then and you were like, “Dude, what is Micropreneur?” It’s a precursor to what MicroComf is today. But I was like, “Who is this guy?” And you’re like, “I was employee number 30 at Facebook, I’m doing these deals,” and it was just this crazy serendipity to be able to meet each other like that. But then AppSumo took off, you went to … I know you went from bundles to individual daily deals and you have the whole thing going now. You grew it, you put a CEO in charge and you moved on to other things and then you came back as CEO. Are you CEO of it today?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, I’m CEO.  Rob Walling:Okay. Tell me about that. Maybe that interim or what’s the story there? You stepped away from it, were you bored, did you want to do other things and then why did you come back.  Noah Kagan:So, we all get bored of success … It’s not success. We get bored of what’s working because it’s not exciting. I remember telling my business partner, I said, “Chad, how is it that you like to do all the things that are boring and I like all the novel stuff? I like starting new businesses.” He’s like, “Everyone likes starting new things, Noah, it’s not just you.” And I do believe it’s a superpower for consistency. Now that I’m 41, if you can stay consistent and keep doing what’s working, you will be successful, period. And it’s so easy to get distracted, it’s just so easy. Even yesterday, on our YouTube team, there’s a guy, Dylan, who just started, he’s like, “Hey, we should try this new thing,” and I was like, “What’s our goal? Don’t get distracted.” We lost a thousand dollars on this thing and I was like, “It’s a thousand-dollar lesson, let’s stay focused.” And with appsumo.com, I got bored because I didn’t want to keep doing … I remember, at the time, I felt like a used car salesman. I’ve got a deal, it’s a car, you got a good price. But it was just more I was bored and that’s something to work on, how to find something that you don’t get bored with like your wives or husbands. And there’s something interesting in that about what areas are we not getting bored at and how do I replicate that in my business which is what I get to do today. And we brought on Amin and we said, “Amin” … And I’ll give a little context there. We said, “Amin, make $120,000 a month revenue and don’t (beep) up, that’s all you have to do here. Don’t do anything creative.” And a lot of people have asked us, “How did you find an Amin which is the CEO for your business?” This is the big point. One, we spent a year recruiting and then we spent 18 months training, that’s literally the main part. People are like, “Oh, you’re going to” … It’s how much time are you putting into it and the way that most businesses, whether you’re team of one or a team of 10, AppSumo is a team of hundred, how does your bench look? So, if you look at a professional sports team, they all have benches and they all have minor leagues or colleges and so what does that look like in your own business and is it being developed or not. And so, at AppSumo, I’m pretty regularly thinking who’s the CEO of these different department, who’s the CEO and who’s going to just take it, not give him permission, I can see who’s taking it. And so, Amin took over and then we started SumoMe which became sumo.com and, over the years, we grew it while, Amin, for the first two years, he just did the exact same thing. It was a few deals a month to make 120,000 and then, once sumo.com actually broke even, we’re like, “Amin, you could do whatever you want now, we don’t have to worry about that money,” and then he was able to do a few things that I can talk about that was really able to help get AppSumo to where we are today. During that time period though, my partner took over Sumo, Amin took AppSumo and I just was like, “Oh, I guess I’m going to” … I was making two to $3 million a year, I’m just going to do a podcast and then I’m going to build some little side projects like sendfox.com, kingsumo.com at a charity bike ride. But this is probably the most shocking part for others and it’s interesting, it was the most unsatisfying three years of my life. And I didn’t want to come back to work, I don’t know, it was just … I wasn’t challenged, it wasn’t hard, it was nice little projects. And there was a big takeaway that I’ll share in that moment but I just felt lost. And that’s not a boohoo, by the way. If someone’s getting rich complaining about it, tell them to shut the hell up. I’m like, “Okay, well, why don’t you” … It’s better to be rich and complain than be poor and complain and so at least everyone should get to that opportunity. That is literally what Million Dollar Weekend is about, it’s you can create that for yourself. Not the complaining part but the being rich part. But the most fascinating thing was Amin’s running the business, everything’s pretty good, I’m doing these little tiny dabbles, let’s call them, and sumo.com is floundering so we folded that team back into AppSumo and doubled down on what was working which was AppSumo. And Amin called me one day, I’m on a bike ride across America and he quit. And my reaction was like, “Hey, do you mind waiting until I get back from my bike ride to quit?” And I think this is a cheat code in all startups, who do you call, who’s your advisors. Can you call Rob Walling? Can you call Noah Kagan? Can you call … I have Andrew Chen, we have Moody Glasgow, I have this guy Roger [inaudible 00:20:41] he’s the CEO of Indeed. We have elite advisors that you could actually pay a thousand dollars an hour or a little more and get access to 10,000-hour people. That’s such a super cheat code that people don’t use enough. So, I called Andrew and I called my buddy Adam from mybodytutor.com and Adam was like, “Who’s paying for the bike trip you’re on?” I’m like, “Well, AppSumo,” and he’s like, “Well, you should probably take care of your business and not go on a bike trip then.” So, I sent the bike home and flew home the next day from my bike ride and then I tried to find another CEO and ultimately I was like, “Okay, I guess I’m” … And this is what we were chatting a little bit before the show, I’m really just afraid, I’m afraid of who I can become, I’m afraid that I can actually do it. And there’s a really powerful thing for all of us is what’s the hardest thing we’re avoiding today in our lives. And for me, I didn’t want to (beep) up the business, and I thought only Amin can do it and I thought I got fired early in my career and that’s been a big part of my story. It’s these guys are better than me, there’s no way I can do it either. And I just had so much fear around it. And then I was like, “Okay, well, at least you go do the hardest thing possible,” and it’s been number one best business decision I’ve ever done  Rob Walling:To come back as CEO?  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Huh.  Noah Kagan:Yeah. And it’s also been the hardest. There’s definitely a lot of days where I’m like, “I am quitting this thing,” but the hardest thing tends to be the things you’re most proud of and the most rewarding. And I think everyone can reflect on that. When you had that moment when you were like, “Oh, this is tough and I’m putting in a lot of work,” but you’re also the most proud of those experiences. And everything I was doing before that, those three years when I was retired of sorts, I just wasn’t committing, I was just like, “All right, let me just dabble,” and I think that’s just such a good thing. What’s the hard thing, go commit to it and it ends up turning out to be, almost all the time, a good thing, you don’t regret those moments of working hard. And it’s been three years and I’ve definitely made a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes in that time period.  Rob Walling:And the business is doing 80 million a year now which is incredible. Where was it at when you took it over?  Noah Kagan:It was doing more.  Rob Walling:Was it really? Oh, my gosh.  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Oh, dude.  Noah Kagan:I know. I know you wanted some hero story-  Rob Walling:I did. I wanted you to say [inaudible 00:22:41] … Yup.  Noah Kagan:… Noah Kagan came and saved the business.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Noah Kagan:Let me caveat that. So, in terms of our, and this is something that … Whenever you’re hearing people, you really got to understand what the actual numbers are. So, there’s gross sales, which is what I’m sharing, and then there’s net revenue which is your refunds and credits or whatever have you then you have net revenue. And you got to be mindful, okay, net revenue, what is gross profit around these numbers then what is your net operating margin, net operating income around that net revenue. And so, what was interesting is we had such a COVID bump, we had such a fat COVID bump, it was great. People wanted to work online, people wanted to save money and so it really was an advantage to us that came back down. And then I made the mistake thinking that I’m super smart, I think I’m bright, but I made another mistake where I didn’t listen to the customers again. So, we strategically said let’s not just do deals, let’s have us a marketplace of products. So, I ran really fast in the wrong direction. I think we can all … You know how that goes. It’s like, “Oh, this is a great idea, I know it’s going to work,” and a lot of these problems can be solved coming back to basic principles of, one, AppSumo motto is test and invest, that is an App … We have an AppSumo playbook and that’s one of our core principles which is did you test it before you invested. And when we break that, I’m like, “Oh, this marketplace where we go from 600 products to 13,000 is definitely going to work,” it didn’t and then we went from 15% margin to around 2% margin of the business.  Rob Walling:Oh.  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:What happened? Hiring?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, we spent a million to do promotion for the marketplace. Our teammate costs per month, we call them teammates, not employees, today it’s about 1.2 million a month, I think we got it up to two and a half, 3 million. So, it was definitely not following some of the principles of test and invest and then double down which is part of our AppSumo playbook. And this year though, we’ve definitely gotten back up to, I think, around 12% margin, reduced a lot of the distractions that I was doing and then just focused on the core of the business, what our customers want. And again, I talk to customers and partners every month and they were all saying, “Hey, we don’t want this marketplace. We just want you choose the best deals possible of the latest tools for us, for solopreneurs.” And I think that’s just such a core thing for all business, who’s your customer, what do they really want and how do you just keep serving that and really understanding what they want and you could test it. Can you test it this weekend, can you test it with a little bit of money, can you test it with not having to spend a bunch and that’s possible. So, definitely, it’s been a fascinating experience and hard experience over these three years.  Rob Walling:I bet. And is that where it stands today? Is the core driver of AppSumo revenue and profit is these weekly deals?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, yeah.  Rob Walling:Okay, yeah. Back to the roots.  Noah Kagan:It’s insane. I will say, one of the key things, the key takeaway for others out there, and I talk about it in Million Dollar Weekend, is just market selection. Are you in a million dollar market? Are you in a thousand dollar market? Are you in a billion dollar market? And it was lucky, I would say, that we chose software 13 years ago and the amount of software there that’s gotten created went from, my first year, there’s probably 20 projects to choose from, 20 businesses to, now, there’s 10,000 different software products. And so, market selection is almost one of the most important things, how many people are there and are they willing to spend. And so, we have other business units now, we have the originals which is basically affordable alternatives to popular software. So, Mailchimp, we have SendFox, Calendly, we have tidycal.com.  Rob Walling:So, you have your Kirkland. These are your Kirkland brands, right? Your house brands, yeah.  Noah Kagan:We call them [inaudible 00:26:07] originals, yeah. So, we think of it as … And it’s our number one way of getting new customers in the AppSumo ecosystem, number one is our originals team. So, that’s a real big takeaway for others out there. Do you have some way to get the ideal customer into your product through something free? Maybe it’s through templates, PDFs, courses, whatever, or a paid product and so ours is TidyCal which brings in, I think, it’s around almost 25% of all new buyers come through TidyCal into the AppSumo ecosystem.  Rob Walling:It’s crazy.  Noah Kagan:Which is amazing, yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Noah Kagan:And a lot of our business now, the amount of sophistication is really interesting. Pricing sophistication, business intelligence sophistication, timing of deals, the structure of how we negotiate maybe rev share so our partners get more as they do better. There’s a lot of things that have compounded that we just were ignorant and just learning and improving over the past three years.  Rob Walling:And so, you’re CEO of AppSumo for the past three years and you have this YouTube channel that you … I’ve watched it because MicroConf, similarly, has doubled down on our YouTube channel. And we’re not at a million but we-  Noah Kagan:A lot of people.  Rob Walling:Yeah. We started during COVID, we had … What’s trip is we announced in 2019 we were going to do a lot more digital stuff because, before that, we were really an in-person event. And so, we said we’re going to do online, we’re going to have a video vault and we wound up launching it right as COVID happened, not because of COVID, it was already on the schedule. And we grew, it took us about a year to get to 10,000 subscribers and then we unlocked some stuff, some secret sauce, if you will, and the next 18 months took us to about … We’re at 70,000 subscribers as of yesterday which is good-  Noah Kagan:Congrats, dude.  Rob Walling:Thank you. It feels-  Noah Kagan:It’s a lot of people.  Rob Walling:It is. And our space is not nearly as big as yours because we are SaaS, we’re Indie Hackers and SaaS and so this market itself is a lot smaller but it feels really good to have that reach. But I’ve watched you do something similar, although at a different scale, add a zero, basically, to the numbers I just said. And watched you experiment with different video types and some would get more views and then you went all in on where you follow people onto their jets and you go to the neighborhoods and ask them how they became billionaires and all this and you’re flying all over the place in a, I’ll say a Mr. Beast way in a way that it feels very tightly produced and very deliberate, very intelligently thought through on how to optimize it.  Noah Kagan:Yeah.  Rob Walling:But I guess I have two questions around this. Why did you decide to do that on YouTube as opposed to some other medium? There’s social media and there’s podcasts and all this stuff. And did that coincide with you coming back as CEO of AppSumo? Were those two decisions made in tandem or were they not coupled and it’s just coincidence that they both happened at the same time?  Noah Kagan:Yeah. One thing I want to take a step back on for everyone out there is all of AppSumo started with me and $50 in a weekend. And the YouTube channel started the same, it was me shirtless, which you can see the video, in my 800-square-foot house where it’s falling down literally, and I just started with my phone and I just uploaded the video. And the reason I’m saying that is, from Million Dollar Weekend, the number one thing that people take away is this mindset of now not how. Don’t worry about the lighting, don’t … I’m in a $20,000 studio in my house now but I started with my phone that everyone has, everyone has the same exact phone as me and they can just record it and you get going. And over time now, AppSumo has a hundred people and we have two people dedicated to business intelligence. We have different pricing stuff that’s going on all the time, we have an email team of, maybe it’s five people, that is testing so many different things in email but that just started 50 bucks in a weekend and got going and you keep going with it and you keep improving it. And that’s the part that you have to get started right now with YouTube or whatever it is to get to those points. I think people want to just figure out the ending and it’s like, “Yeah, that’s only going to get there if you get going. You can’t cook if you’re not in the kitchen.” And so, I think that’s just such an important thing for anyone out there whether it’s a SaaS business, which me and you have done a lot of, or whether it’s a content business or whatnot. So, I think the key thing around the YouTube content, similar to AppSumo, is what’s the thing that’s working and how are you doing more of it. And so, for AppSumo, we analyze what product categories and we have an algorithm around what products our customers are excited about and then the business development team goes and gets a lot more of those. And so, with the YouTube channel, I commit to … It’s called the law of 100 which is do a hundred of it and then quit or make the decision to quit because we quit too soon. I quit my podcast, I’ve restarted it and I’ve stuck with it, but I quit it too soon, I quit it around 30 to 50 episodes. If I just would’ve got to the 100, I would be at really high numbers. And so, whatever you’re doing, a hundred sales, a hundred days, a hundred videos, a hundred emails, whatever it is, just get it to a hundred of them and then you can make a more informed decision and you can keep improving along the way. You can improve your cameras, you can improve the lighting, you can improve your scripts, you can improve your thumbnails, you can improve these different parts of your business. Now, I tried growing all the different social channels. So, when it happened, I tried YouTube and then Instagram and I hate TikTok so I don’t really do any TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter and blog and all these channels can work to be clear, a podcast as well. All of them can work but what I recognize is who’s the customer I actually like, what channel do I have maybe some advantage in and which one has the opportunity because I want to have an unfair advantage. I don’t want to compete fairly, it’s just not-  Rob Walling:Of course not.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, I want to win where not others are winning and it’s easier for me to win. And so, as I noticed, I can’t do all six and win, I can do one and win. So, I told the team we’re not doing anything but YouTube and the reason I did that is I was trying all of them and I saw, okay, we’re doing this much work and here’s the reward, meaning views or whatnot, and I enjoyed making content there. And so, that’s what I’d recommend for others, it could be podcasts. I tried podcasts, growing it for years, it was really hard, there’s just only … And now, with YouTube and Shorts, you can grow a podcast in a different way but it’s still challenging, there’s only so much podcast time. And then Twitter, the audience isn’t growing. And LinkedIn, it’s very competitive with all these different agency people. And Instagram, I don’t take photos and I don’t do TikTok. And blogging, I think that amount of search and traffic is declining. All right, it leaves a site that gets what a billion people a month and it is a little harder as you get to higher levels of video. We’re spending on, per video, I don’t know, maybe 30,000 if you look at salaries and editing and thumbnail designer and consultants and all this different travel stuff and I can talk about that. But in terms of that, it was just basically doing that analysis and, I will say, we did three videos a week for 50 weeks and almost none of them were really getting views. And so, the point for everyone, besides the law of 100, is find something you just, even if it’s not working great, you’re still satisfied. I was still having fun, I was like, “Even if this is not getting an insane result, I’m still having fun.” And then we were basically desperate, we’re like, “Hey, we’re not really growing, why don’t we just try something 180?” And so, we tried a video, we saw it on Instagram or somewhere where a guy went to someone’s door and we’re like, “What if we made a whole video” … Because we were always curious what rich people did in these houses so I was like, “I’ll just go knock on their doors and ask what they do for a living.” And that video, it’s crazy because it took two full days of filming to get 10 minutes of content. It’s so interesting because people are like, “Oh, you just go knock on the door and” … Dude, most people will reject, most people say, “What are you”-  Rob Walling:Yeah. What are you doing at home?  Noah Kagan:Yeah. They’re like, “Please get the hell out of my house,” I would. I’m paranoid about people coming to my house. That video, through some desperation, frankly, because the ways I operate AppSumo, the ways I operate my book, the ways I’m operating our YouTube channels, we have one goal. And so, we were at 170,000 subs and we wanted to get to 250 and we had about 40 days left and so we just had to do something more extreme to see if we could get it to work and that video got it to a million views. And then you’ll see that almost, double down, this is another AppSumo motto, I think these ones people know but no one does. No one actually does it the way we do, very few do. They do something that works and then they go do new things. And this is part of Amin’s, I would say, influence with me which was, this is working, double down and, not just once, but until it stops working. So, now, there’s a lot more people copying or going on the streets asking rich people or knocking on doors so we’re shifting and I can talk more about that. But you can see the channel, it was jets, yachts, first class passengers, streets of New York, streets of Monaco, streets of Switzerland, streets of Austin, [inaudible 00:34:29] but it was working and so it was doing a lot more of that and I think that’s a really core part of any business. And whenever I meet entrepreneurs that made their business and growing fast or they’re asking how to grow it, I’m like, “How did you get your last customer? How’d you get your first customers? How much of that are you doing?” They’re like, “Oh, yeah, I’m not really doing as much of it,” “Just do that.” So, that’s been really the growth strategy content wise. And so, we basically just found two types of content that works like these asking super rich people or interviewing older billionaires, frankly, and asking them their regrets. And so, lately, it’s really just doubling down on that content.  Rob Walling:Does the YouTube channel feed … What’s the end goal of that because it’s not … We have 70,000 subscribers and our most popular videos maybe has 150,000 views and I see-  Noah Kagan:nice, man.  Rob Walling:Yeah, no, thanks. Again, add a zero to those numbers if you’re listening and that’s what Noah has. But I see the payments from YouTube and we don’t even break even on our production costs so I know you’re not doing it for that. So, would it-  Noah Kagan:We’re not breaking even.  Rob Walling:There’s no chance but what is-  Noah Kagan:No, we’re not breaking even.  Rob Walling:But is the feedback into AppSumo? Is that the …  Noah Kagan:So, there are businesses, we’re fortunate, I think, a lot of YouTube, similar to you in that a lot of YouTubers that have to have a course and then they have to sell these other things but we have a business, AppSumo, that’s our sponsor, really, for the channel and we don’t do a good job integrating at the end of the day. I do think that most businesses should have some presence and I think most people connect with a person, not a brand. If you think about Nike, Nike’s not popular because of the swoosh or their shoes are really that great, you connect with it because it’s Tiger or LeBron or whoever the person is. And so, I do think we’ve surveyed and around 30% of people that buy AppSumo who know who I am. They’re like, “Oh, I think I’ve seen your videos or I’ve seen the stuff.” And what we started doing this year and what we’re going to get better at is I’m like an affiliate of AppSumo and so I have tracking on my content and so how do we do things that drive either new signups or awareness or direct sales into AppSumo. But yes, it’s not well integrated in our business.  Rob Walling:Not yet but you can get there.  Noah Kagan:Well, I think people-  Rob Walling:You can build the audience and then you can do it.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, people seeing AppSumo logo, seeing me wear the AppSumo clothing, I think our business … Not I think. Our business is very direct marketing ROI based so how much are we spending and then how much are we making back within six months or less and everything. And we spend about a half a million dollars a month around that and it’s all profitable. The problem with that is that it doesn’t expose our brand. So, moving 2024, one of our core strategies is brand awareness. So, how do we get people who are solopreneurs or curiepreneurs or wantrapreneurs and getting them like, “Yeah, I need some help with tools or maybe education around getting my business going, I’m going to go to Rob and then maybe I’ll check out AppSumo and see what tools they have available.”  Rob Walling:Well, I want to get to your book because we’re wrapping up on time. So, milliondollarweekend.com, the book is Million Dollar Weekend and you cover a ton of topics, getting better at rejection, it’s all about being an entrepreneur. It’s about starting a company, as you say, a million-dollar company in a weekend. Idea generation, growth playbook, lifestyle design, even have a section about managing your calendar to be more productive. Folks can obviously check that out if they want to dive into those topics. What I’m curious to hear about you is a little more of a meta question because I’ve written three books plus an ebook, and I’m working on a fourth, in essence, with my wife about selling companies. Why a book now? You’ve been an entrepreneur for so long, people have known your name, why do it? Because writing a book is a pain in the ass, I don’t know if people-  Noah Kagan:Dude, it’s so hard.  Rob Walling:Brutal, huh? And there’s no feedback loop. You do a YouTube video and it goes live in a few weeks. You write a book, it’s (beep) two years, man. It’s like, “What is happening?”.  Noah Kagan:It was three years, I know. And people buy books, people don’t read books. And selling a book, right now, I’m personally messaging Facebook people. So, a lot of … I’m posting. We built a launch team. And I do think one of the things I’ve done well with AppSumo and YouTube, I reply to people one-on-one and that’s something I talk about in the book and something I still do in all of my businesses which is most businesses are actually comprised of individuals, customers like Ruben, one of our mutual friends from Bidsketch, I don’t know what his new thing is called.  Rob Walling:SignWell.  Noah Kagan:SignWell, yeah. Ruben was one of the first AppSumo customers. Thirteen years later, I DM him how’s the fam and I think we disconnect some of that and that’s been a part of the book where … I posted, “Hey, I’m building a launch team, is anyone interested?” and then I DM every single person who said yes, asked them to buy the book and I have them join our launch team and it’s individual and that’s missed out on. Now, in terms of the book itself, it’s about 15 years ago I thought of writing a book on a bike ride. I was like, “There’s no book out there.” I’m frustrated, I’ve never seen a book that I can give to my cousin, I can give to a friend, I can give to a reader, I can give to a customer of AppSumo that, if you want to get a business going and change your life in 48 hours, which everyone has, everyone has a weekend, there’s nothing that can do it. If there is, let me know, I wouldn’t have written the book, it would’ve saved me a bunch of time. And I thought that was an interesting opportunity. And so, that was 15 years ago but I wanted to start more of my own businesses, I wanted to test it to see if it actually worked for others and then I wanted to be at a place where I felt like I could really share the message with the best collaborators possible. It’s easy to write a book, it’s hard to write a great book, it’s nearly impossible to get a book to change someone’s life is what I’m noticing. And so, I’m doing everything possible to stack the deck, is the way I think about it, in that this book will impact people to … Maybe they don’t need to be a millionaire, I think everyone should be a millionaire, it’s awesome but maybe they want to be a grocerynaire, maybe they want enough grocery money for the weekend, maybe they want to just turn their interest in woodworking into an actual business or they want to create a software product or SaaS business but they’re a little bit stuck. And what was crazy about entrepreneurship is there’s an unlimited amount of content out there but, if it’s so unlimited, how come others aren’t succeeding in starting a business? That’s the main thing that needs to get solved. And so, the book starts off with fun and really overcoming the two giant things that hold everyone back from success in entrepreneurship which is starting and asking and how to make those enjoyable so that people can overcome them in a fun way and then use that with strategy to then lead it to million-dollar opportunities and getting businesses going in a very short period of time.  Rob Walling:And that’s the USP of the book is that it is, not just your take on entrepreneurship, but it is that very constrained timeline and it’s your approach that I’ve heard you talk about over the years about getting used to rejection, about seeking problems before … People don’t want solutions, they want … What is it? They don’t want software, they want a solution to their problem or something like that, they don’t want another tool.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, no one cares about your idea.  Rob Walling:Yeah. No, yeah, idea.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, no one cares about your idea.  Rob Walling:Totally. So, I have this quote, when entrepreneurs come to me now, I say don’t tell me your idea, tell me what problem it solves and for whom. That’s my new thing, I say that to everybody and so it’s just right in line. What’s funny, dude, is, 15 years ago, I don’t know that we would’ve thought this but, as you progress, we all come up with these similar learnings. The rules of thumb are similar across SaaS, across entrepreneurship, across a jerky company that you talk about starting in a weekend as a challenge, right?  Noah Kagan:Well, your audience is a lot of SaaS people, I’ll just tell you openly. So, the frustration I have today, I hate QuickBooks, I hate DocuSign … Shout out, SignWell, Ruben, you can check out. But I also hate subscriptions and I hate Loom. Well, I think Loom is cool but it’s five videos and then you can’t use it anymore, you have to pay and I’m like, “Hmm.” So, what most people do now is that they’ll consume more content, they’ll wait on the sidelines, they’ll do more research and what you can actually do is find out, within 48 hours, everyone has a weekend, whether if you have a family and kids like you, whether you’re single, whether you’re old, whatever that is, it’s non-exclusive to actually see if you can get that business started. And so, for instance, let’s say you wanted to start a SignWell competitor which we’re evaluating … Shout out, Ruben. I love you, man. But I hate subscriptions and I’m frustrated with DocuSign and doing PDFs so can we create something like that at AppSumo within a very short period of time. And the idea for everyone, if you want to do that, you could literally message people and say, “Hey, I’m building a software today. It’s going to do this, here’s what to expect, can you prepay me for an early version of it?” And you could truly find out whether you can get customers for that or not. And then, if you get customers, great, go build it. And if you can’t, then you can try to understand in a conversation what problems they do have that they’d be excited to pay you for. That’s the fun, frankly, and the interesting challenge of entrepreneurship.  Rob Walling:Noah Kagan, thanks so much for joining me on the show, man. Folks who want to keep up with you, youtube.com/noahkagan, milliondollarweekend.com?  Noah Kagan:Yeah, I think it’s YouTube.com … Just go to milliondollarweekend.com, we have a 48-hour challenge in there, there’s a ton of resources, you can see my income streams which a lot of people like to see and there’s just a lot of things to get going. People have so much fear and you really can change your life in a short period of time without money and that’s the part that people are like, “Oh, (beep) maybe I can do these things.” Same as me being a CEO, I was like, “I don’t know if I can actually do this,” and the reality is we can, we just have to go get started.  Rob Walling:The dirty secret is, most of us, a good chunk of the time, feel like we’re in over our head and are scared.  Noah Kagan:Yeah, it doesn’t matter how successful or famous or rich you are. And I do believe and I see it all the time still that there’s a lot of ordinary people doing really well and the only difference between them and someone else is that they’re starting. And through that iteration of posting the video, of seeing if they can get someone to buy, of doing a service, of maybe even using a WordPress plugin as their software provider or using backend AI stuff, ChatGPT, whatever that is and then getting the customer, it’s like, “Huh, what else can I take this?”  Rob Walling:It’s an awesome note to leave it on, man. Thanks again for joining me. Thanks again to Noah for joining me on the show. It’s great to have you back this and every week. I’m really enjoying recording this podcast again, it’s so fun to be reinvigorated after taking time off over the holidays.

In this episode, I talk through seven predictions SaaS bootstrappers should pay attention to in 2024. Obviously, these predictions might apply if you’re not bootstrapping, if you’ve raised a small amount of funding. I just like to differentiate between those folks who are trying to raise $50-million dollars in venture capital versus those of us in the capital efficient bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped space. After I run through these predictions, I’m going to go back at the end of the episode, and I’m going to go back as far as I can stomach, probably 2013, and look at predictions that I made every year and go through them quickly, and talk about whether I think they were accurate. What we’ll find is a lot of them weren’t accurate the year I made them, but within a year or two those things came to fruition. It was really fascinating looking back at give-or-take 10 years of predictions. I believe there was a year or two that I didn’t make predictions, but I’ll save that for the end of the episode in case that is less interesting to you. In addition, if you’re interested in chatting with me at an upcoming MicroConf local or you have a strategy or a framework that you think other bootstrap SaaS founders should hear, we are always looking for founders to come out and share their expertise during all of our conferences and events. If you’re interested, head to MicroConf.com/pitches and share your idea with us. So with that, let’s dive right in to my first prediction, and it’s that in 2024 there is going to be a lot of opportunity in vertical SaaS. This is more of a continuation of a trend that I’m already seeing. If you look at the TinySeed companies that we have funded, we’re just over 151 at the time of this recording, a lot of them serve a particular vertical. So when people say, “Vertical SaaS, what does that mean?” Well, an example of accounting software designed specifically for construction firms. Construction firms is the vertical, it’s the niche. Versus something like QuickBooks that can serve every vertical, or think of podcast hosting or podcast recording, that is a horizontal SaaS, meaning you can use it in any niche. Just a few examples of companies that we’ve funded in the most recent batch, one is called TrainerMetrics, which focuses on fitness centers. We have Tiny Easy out of New Zealand that focuses on … Think of CAD software, but it’s for tiny house designers. Talk about an interesting and relatively small vertical. Retail Metrics is analytics for independent brick-and-mortar retailers. Mawi is project management for constructions firms across Latin America, and on and on. You can go to TinySeed.com/portfolio anytime to see these companies. But if you look across our entire portfolio, Anar and I have been talking about running the numbers, the majority of the companies we’ve funded, and I think it’s the supermajority to be honest, a majority is 51% and a supermajority is more than two-thirds, 67%, I think it’s even more than that, if I were to guess, I think it’s in the 75% to 80% range, of companies that we have funded over the past several years have been vertical SaaS. There’s so many reasons why vertical SaaS is more optimal, especially for bootstrappers. I called a lot of them out in Start Small, Stay Small back in 2010 and I talk about why it’s good to go niche, is really what I say there. But these days almost all of those reasons still apply about it being less competitive, about you don’t need to be the best marketer in the world, you just need to be a better marketer than the other folks in your niche. So I see this trend of vertical SaaS alive and well and continuing strong in 2024. My second prediction ties back to a company I just named, is that SaaS will continue to grow, and it will even pick up space in emerging markets. For instance, Latin America. That’s an area where we, TinySeed, have funded several companies who are serving the Latin American market. The interesting thing that we found is their price points often have to be lower just because of the way currency works and salaries, and the reason you can hire a developer for half the price or a third of the price down there is the cost of living is lower, so folks don’t have as much money, disposable income, and businesses don’t have as much disposable income. But it’s also much easier to market, or it can be cheaper to market and find customers, and it is also cheaper to hire in those areas. So if you’re based in Costa Rica, as Mawi is, they have a real advantage over a US company trying to come in and compete against them to sell to Costa Rican and other Latin American construction firms. They also know the space, they know the geography and everything, but we’ve seen a really nice uptick in B2B SaaS applicants who are in these more verging spaces. If you don’t know the space the first time you see it, you think, “Oh, well the money’s not going to be there. The price points aren’t going to be there.” But the further we’ve gotten into it, we’ve seen there’s real opportunity there. So that’s why I made it prediction number two. My third prediction is about Twitter. You might call it X, I still call it Twitter. Let’s be honest, Twitter is really struggling. The valuation is way down, it’s I would say under-monetized, it’s just not making enough money. It has been tanking, maybe in the bootstrap SaaS space or what do you call it, VC Twitter and tech journalist Twitter, it is still, I won’t say booming, but it’s still alive. In most other spaces, like all the other verticals that used to use it, I think of Dave Kellett who is the cartoonist I often mention on Comic Lab, he says it’s pretty much a ghost town now and it doesn’t work for them. So these comic artists that are trying to promote their self-published work, it’s completely useless in essence. So Twitter is by all accounts struggling, and my prediction for 2024 is that there is going to be a big moment of reckoning. One guess is that the bank or the equity funds that lent Elon the money to buy it will basically call it due and foreclose and repossess. You don’t know what their contracts say, but there’s going to be something there where they’re not going to just want to sit on this asset that is basically depreciating quickly. I forget what the exact valuation difference is between when he bought it and what it is now, but it’s really pretty scary. So there is a reckoning coming for that. I think that Twitter might change hands again in 2024, that is probably the ultimate prediction. Whether it’s that the bank forces a sale, and I say the bank, it’s the financiers, I don’t know if it’s technically a bank, but the financiers that lent Elon the money are going to call it due and either take it over or force a foreclosure sale to someone else, or Elon’s going to decide it’s not the problem. I don’t know. But I think Twitter is going to have a major event probably resulting in a change of ownership. My fourth prediction for SaaS bootstrappers this year is that subscription fatigue will continue to be a thing in B2C, but it will not be a big deal with B2B. You’re going to see complaints on Twitter, you’re going to see complaints on Facebook, whatever other social media you’re on, but it’s not actually going to make that big of a difference, because that’s what I’m seeing across the 171 investments I’ve made is that SaaS is still very much alive and well. It is the best business model on the planet, and that subscriptions are very much alive and well, and that businesses are happy to pay for it if you can take the headache away from them, you can solve a real pain point for them. So in other words, I’m saying that Once, which 37signals is doing at Once.com where they’re saying, “We’re going to write software that you don’t pay a subscription for.” That Once will not penetrate, that’s my prediction, they will not penetrate past the handful of nerdy developers who basically want to manage their own servers. I never want to go back there. I don’t want to build software like that, I don’t want to install and manage software like that. That is how we did it 20 years ago, and while I think there is a very small niche of people who will embrace that and say, “Yay. I get to pay a one-time fee and not have to subscribe.” I think that subscription fatigue in B2B, while we may hear people complain about it, is not going to broadly impact the adoption of SaaS. My fifth prediction is that no-code/low-code will professionalize, is the word I’m using, and what I don’t mean to say it’s not professional today, because obviously there are professional no-code and low-code developers, and obviously these technologies run a lot of apps, but what I mean is no-code and low-code are behind code in the sense of what about code review tools? What about unit testing? It’s funny, when I say “code review tools,” well, there isn’t any code, but you get the idea. There are automations that can be complex, and the reason you have code review is to make sure the code is going to work as expected and it’s maintainable. So what about no-code review? No-code and low-code review tools. What about the ability to have unit tests, version control to be able to roll back to prior versions? That is something that came about with development that these things … Version control before, I think the first time I ever used it was probably 2001 or ’02, and before then I know it exists, I know Visual Source have existed before then, I know that there was version control, but it just wasn’t as broadly used as it is now. It’s just an expectation. Unit testing really become prominent until, my memory is it was about ’06, ’07 maybe, and code review was not really a thing that we did back in the day. Actually, we did have to start doing it, I worked at a credit card company and for PCI compliance another developer had to look at your code before you checked it in. I remember that being such a big shift, and this was again in the aughts. So these things emerged over time, and code had been written since, what is it, the ’50s or the ’60s? Where we started writing codes with punch cards, I say “we,” I’m not that old, but where folks started writing code and code review unit testing and version control was nowhere near as ubiquitous as it is today. No-code and low-code have the advantage of being able to learn from code, from the software development best practices and the patterns that have been developed over decades. No-code, low-code have the advantage of seeing the arrows in the back of the pioneers, of folks who wrote code for many, many years. I think that will accelerate the professionalization of no-code and low-code. My sixth prediction is about AI, and really it’s that the obvious AI stuff, we’re going to be through that this year. We’re going to start to get into novel and surprising integrations with a lot of the tools we use, or novel and surprising new apps that aren’t just a thing that again is so obvious to build. So I think additionally, automated customer service is going to be something that’s going to continue to not be very good. I think it will get better with AI, but I was super frustrated on a website, I think it was a bank website the other day, and I just couldn’t get to a representative, they just wouldn’t let me. I was like, “I know that AI can not do this for me.” So I think it’s going to continue to roll out and it’s going to be spotty and not great, but I do think that AI is going to help us as software people build faster. It’s already doing that with Copilot, but it’s going to continue to accelerate the development of software. I don’t believe AI is going to take a bunch of developer jobs, I think this is the rising tide that raises all the boats. Unless you’re a real … developer and you don’t or you resist AI, or you don’t want to use it, it becomes this tool of augmentation that I think developers and builders and product people and all of us are smart to adopt. But my hope is that the hype of it … When we look back at mobile apps in the Apple App Store in what, was that ’08, ’09 as that emerged? Then SaaS started to become a thing, there was crypto around this time and blockchain was maybe 2015, ’16 as it first started. There was even the drone, there was VR/AR, there’s all these waves where people rush in, and AI certainly has been that for what, 12, 15 months now? Each of these has their lifecycle, and they have the hype cycle at the start, then it dies down, and sometimes, like I believe with AR and VR, it becomes cool. It’s a neat thing that you can use, although VR and AR are still not as widely adopted as we’ll see in some of my predictions a little later in this episode, but other times people just don’t adopt it. So blockchain, is that actually being used? If blockchain went away today, are there major parts of our world that wouldn’t function? Probably not. The adoption there just didn’t happen, versus mobile phones where the mobile app store and all the mobile apps that we have have just become parts of our daily life, for better or worse. The hype cycle, you can argue was it real? Did it change everything? It did change everything, but it just becomes a day-to-day thing. That is my expectation of AI in 2024, there will continue to a ton of VC money being pumped into it. It’s the new wave that allow more efficiency to be done. I hope the hype cycle does continue so much that tens of millions or billions, I should say tens of billions of dollars keep getting pumped in. Maybe they do. But I think AI is certainly here to stay, and this year we will see I think a continuation of that argument of like, “Is it hype? Is it not?” But see some real productivity gains and some real pushes forward. I know some people say like, “I’m not even using ChatGPT anymore.” You know what? I don’t use it that much either, but when I use it it has been really helpful to me. I was doing a brainstorming session with ChatGPT earlier today and it gave me a ton of new ideas and thoughts that I just couldn’t find in a search engine, and just weren’t in my head. When I framed the prompt very specifically, it gave me some great information. So I’m neither bullish nor bearish on AI, I think in general it’s a good thing. I think there’s obviously some ethical issues, and I think people just get a little too bent out of shape in both directions in terms of hating it or love it. I also felt that way about NFTs, blockchain, all that. But all that said, AI’s going to be a thing, and people are still going to be talking about it throughout 2024. My seventh and final prediction for 2024, I have no inside information, I think Stripe’s going to finally go public. The question is what does that mean for SaaS companies? Does it mean that they get on that 90-day cycle, that quarterly earnings treadmill, which I believe is the reason they haven’t gone public is because the Collison brothers are very smart and they don’t want to be on that push. They want to be more in control of their company, and the ability to manage it and not have to have Wall Street constantly breathing down your neck to tell you, “Increase earnings. Increase earnings. Increase earnings.” Because that of course leads to what are they going to do, raise their rates? There’s all kinds of things that they can start doing that are really going to piss people off. So that’s my big question is if they go public, will they be under the gun? So Google in the early days, if I remember, I remember them going public around 2000, 2001, you can correct me if I’m wrong, but in the early days I remember them thumbing their nose at the whole, “Every quarter has to be better than the last quarter.” But eventually that happened, maybe it took five years, maybe it took 10 years, I don’t actually remember. I haven’t owned Google stock since probably the first year it was public, so I don’t pay that much attention to it, but I do remember there was a shift from the “Don’t be evil” to “Wow, we’re really going to squeeze the money out of everybody.” When they really started screwing a lot of the organic SEOs and they started removing data from the ability to be able to rank in Google. It was obvious it was a big cash grab. So the question is if Stripe goes public, as I’m predicting, will that start now? Or will Stripe be able to hold out for a year or three years, five years before the cash grab mode that Wall Street eventually forces almost every company into begins? Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

Now I’m going to go back, I’m going to roll the calendar back to late 2012 where I made predictions for 2013, and I’m going to zip through these and just talk about whether I think they were right, wrong or right eventually. Like the person who predicts five of the last two recessions, eventually you’ll be right if you keep saying the stock market’s going to go down. So in 2012, making predictions for 2013, I predicted it would be the year of Pinterest, which it may or may not have been, but it’s just irrelevant now. So it’s funny to read that. That WordPress will become more prominent, and I would say that’s pretty dead on. Think about this, this is 11 years ago, WordPress was a going concern, but this is like a year into WP Engine, it was still very early and we didn’t realize that WordPress would run, I won’t say the majority of the internet, but it runs a hell of a lot of the internet. So I think that was a prediction that was pretty good. Subscription WordPress plugins will start, I do think this has happened, although it’s not as ubiquitous as I would have thought. I knew a lot of WordPress developers back then and I knew folks were tired of the one-time model and they were trying to get into the annual subscriptions, and some tried to get into monthly as well. It’s definitely happening now more than it was back then, but it has not grown like wildfire. Another prediction was more Google changes will hammer the SEOs, and I don’t just mean algorithm updates. That was me talking about Google just cash grabbing, so this is around the time that was happening. That was true, yeah. I stand by that one. Finally, for 2013 I predicted the startup bubble would become more evident, inflated valuations will continue to rise, either it bursting this year or next. That absolutely did not happen. The only bursting, there was a public market bursting for a month in January of 2016, and then up, up, up, up until 2020, and there was a big drop for a very short time. Then it just went up, up, up, and the big one that has actually lasted in the startup space is 2022. So think about how far off I was on that. I often find bear predictions, meaning predicting something’s going to go down, are usually way too early. So now let’s look at 2014 predictions. Ooh, this is where I start talking about Twitter, and so many of these were accurate they were just early. So my first one is Twitter will become profitable and piss off its users in the process, but it’s a solid opportunity for paid placement and promotion. So I don’t think Twitter has ever become a solid opportunity for paid placement and promotion, Twitter didn’t become profitable for several years after this, and I do not believe Twitter became profitable in 2014, but it was profitable for a couple years after it went public. I believe it was public for eight years before Elon Musk took it private, is that right? It was profitable for two of those years. So I’m a little early, but I think it’s a reasonable prediction. I predicted an Apple Watch would be released, although I called it the iWatch, and the Apple Watch did not release until 2015, so a little early with that one. I think there were some rumors or some buzz, so think of this it’s like December of 2013 I’m making this prediction. Next one for 2014 was that Concierge will become a requirement for SaaS apps in crowded markets. This was before White Glove, Concierge, customer success was just becoming a thing, so I 100% stand by this. It’s a little easy, I was on the bleeding edge of it as a SaaS founder myself and someone who interacts with a lot of folks through the podcast and through MicroConf, but I definitely called that shot and I stand by it. Kickstarter will have a major multimillion dollar failure. I don’t remember if that happened. I know there have been several of them, but who knows if it happened in 2014? Apple will continue to lose market share. I think I meant the iPhone. As history repeats itself 30 years later, that did not happen. Integration marketing will pick up steam as more companies offer APIs and become more connected, and I do think that has been a thing. I think that’s happened and integration marketing has continue to serve bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS founders. All right, for 2015, Twitter will become, I made the same prediction again, Twitter will become profitable and piss off its users in the process. I figured if I wasn’t right one year, because obviously I wasn’t right in 2014, so I made the same prediction again for ’15. Another prediction was that video ads, namely YouTube ads, will be a big opportunity for cheap clicks in 2015. Man, I know YouTube ads are a still an opportunity for cheap clicks today. So I would say that’s a win. VR will actually be a hit with the early adopters set in 2015. There’s no way that happened. Until the Oculus Quest 2, even now is VR a hit? I play because my kids play and I want to be in games and hanging out with them, but I think it’s still iffy. It’s nowhere near as ubiquitous as I think … I think when I put “hit” in quotes, I think I envisioned more adoption than we’re seeing today. It’s getting there, it’s just taking a long time. Another prediction was we’ll see our first sub, $100 a year, consumer level, five terabyte cloud storage service. No idea if that took place. Certainly predicting that storage is going to get cheaper was a pretty safe bet, Walling. So maybe make yours a little more ambitious next time. The last prediction was we’ll start seeing 3D printers in houses of our early adopters friends. I think that one’s accurate, I certainly got a 3D printer probably in 2015 or ’16, we’re now on our second one, and we’ve had them around for years and loved them. I know a lot of my friends now have resin printers and the PLA printers, I’d say I was right about this one eventually. For 2016, I like these, so the first one is single round bootstrapping, AKA fund-strapping. That’s what I have in the notes for that outline. Single round bootstrapping, AKA fund-strapping, will become a common viable option. What can I say? I’m like Babe Ruth calling shots here. Yes, did it happen? That was my 2016 prediction, did it happen in 2016? Not as much as it happened in the years following for sure, since I think I make this prediction again in 2018 after I left Drip and started talking about why we started TinySeed. I started TinySeed because I wanted to take advantage of what I was already seeing in the space. I didn’t say I was seeing that in the space because I started TinySeed. I think some people get that backwards. We’ll hear from me about this type of prediction again in a minute. Another prediction for 2016, Twitter will become less relevant, returning to its roots, journalists and the Technorati, ripe for an acquisition. So again, that didn’t happen in ’16, but it happened eventually. Public markets continue to value companies lower than their private valuations, and that was true, although I think there was, what do you call it, an aversion for a while. But then certainly by the time we were at 2018 to now, maybe not to now, but to 2021 that was happening. Companies would go public at a lower valuation than their private valuations. My last prediction for 2016 was that VR will actually be a hit with the early adopter set in 2016. No, didn’t happen. Four predictions for 2017, there will be another high profile acquisition in the bootstrapped space. I don’t think that happened. I remember revisiting this one and saying it didn’t happen. Second one is startup crowdfunding will fizzle out. Lower and startups will use it, the best will continue to use their network and angel list. Kind of, right? I guess these days the fundraising environment isn’t great, and we saw a few higher profile crowdfunding rounds of startups, and frankly those haven’t gone well, at least the ones that are in our Twitter-sphere. So I would say, again, this was a 2017 prediction, so it’s now seven years ago, but that is what has played out in my opinion. I predicted a 20% or more US stock market correction, which did not happen. That didn’t happen until what, 2020? Then it recovered, and then really I think it was 2022 when that happened again. My fourth and final prediction for ’17 was the first consumer purchased package would legally be delivered with unmanned drones somewhere in the world. I believe I was making that prediction in December of 2017, and I think it happened that month. So I got a little lucky, also I was probably reading some rumor tables when I made that prediction. Now for 2018, 2018 will be the year of non-institutional startup funding, angels crowdfunding and ICOs. That was probably pretty close. AI machine learning will continue to be marketed as the next big thing, but will not deliver again in 2018. That was accurate. Now, eventually it delivered obviously. What would you say? It was 2022 I think was when OpenAI had the big ChatGPT reveal, but this one I was correct. I predicted in 2018 there would be an enormous crash in Bitcoin’s valuation, but longterm I was still bullish. Oh, yeah. Boy, there was a massive crash, so it was up around, it looks like it peaked almost at 20,000 in December of 2017, and it was down to 17,000 and then in ’18 it’s like 12,000 at the start of the year, and by the end of the year Bitcoin was at 3250 give or take. There’s peaks in the valleys, but so this one was correct. Me being still bullish I would say is correct, because as I’m recording this Bitcoin is at 44,000. So that was a good call back in ’18. My fourth prediction for 2018 was cryptocurrencies will be regulated by several large governments. I don’t remember if that happened in ’18, but it certainly started … We started seeing that in ’18, ’19 and ’20, and it would impact … A country would ban mining, and then they would regulate it in a certain way, and we would see the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies impacted. All right, now for 2019, four predictions. Crypto will have ups and downs, but no major boom in 2019, but I’m still bullish longterm. I think that was correct. When I look at the chart, it really was relatively flat. I guess it entered 2019 at $3400 US, and it left … No, I was incorrect. I guess it ended at $7000 US. So it did have, it doubled, it actually went higher than that. So bullish longterm, probably correct, at least at that point. But no major boom was not correct. I predicted 2019 would be the year of AR. Way early, still hasn’t happened. I predicted there’d be a Facebook antitrust issue, and there would be a rise of a new social network, and I would say no on the Facebook antitrust, and there were some legal stuff but not in the way I was thinking, and the rise of a new social network I believe … Did TikTok start getting big in ’19? So there’s a chance that I actually predicted that. I had no idea it would be TikTok, but I figured there’d be room for another. My other 2019 prediction, no joke, that Twitter would be acquired. So I predicted it in 2019 and it happened in 2022, so only three short years too early. Okay, just one more year, because I skipped 2020, ’22 and ’23 for making predictions. So my ’24 predictions were at the start of this episode, and 2021 predictions, which think about this, I’m making predictions December of 2020 so COVID is still rampant and vaccine’s not out until, I think it got vaccinated May of ’21, and some people got a couple months earlier, but really the vaccine was not available, no in-person events, sheltering in place, all kinds of madness. So I’m making that prediction with that in mind, and it looks like I have five predictions. First is privacy concerns will transform email marketing back to a more primitive form, and I would say not really. I know that open rates are harder to see now, I know that there’s a lot of stuff making email marketing harder, but I don’t think it’s been transformed. I still think it’s valuable and super viable, so I’d say no on this. I predicted in-person events will resume in ’21 with adjustments like social distancing and masks. That was true, that was me being optimistic because running MicroConf, I really wanted to get back to in-person events, and we started running them in I think it was September of 2021. So that did happen that year. My third prediction was that funding in the bootstrap startup space would continue to be de-stigmatized, I guess was it still stigmatized in 2020? I know that just a lot more people were open to it, and people don’t judge bootstrappers for raising money like they used to. They would call them sellouts and that kind of stuff, and I just don’t see that happening. My fourth prediction was that VR will become mainstream, probably not. I use it and I have friends who use it and I use it with my kids and we play games and this and that, but I just don’t think I would describe it as mainstream. My fifth and final prediction for 2021 was that the world will get back to normal faster than expected post COVID-19. My memory is that’s not true. I remember it taking a long time for things to feel back to normal, that even once we started traveling I was vaccinated, I wore masks. Having masks at events, it just didn’t make it feel normal. It took a long, long time for that to revert back. It was still six, nine, 12 months after that I remember people still … There would still be enough people at events wearing masks that it felt weird to be at the events, and it reminded you that COVID-19 was still such a thing. So I would say I did not hit the nail on the head with that prediction. If you made it this far, this is truly just a nostalgia play for me to walk back through some of these and to think, “What was the world like in 2012?” Or was it December 2011? Yeah, December 2012 when I’m making these predictions for 2013, to say WordPress is going to be prominent, and to look back now and be like, “Oh, my gosh. Doesn’t it run almost 50% of the internet?” But it really was different back then, it’s hard to get back in that head space. I don’t plan to do this every year, every prediction episode by the way, I just happened to stumble upon these old prediction episodes and I know that we used to revisit them every year, we’d make a prediction and then we would, in the next prediction episode, we would look back and rate our predictions, and then we’d make the new ones. I think I’ll probably just start planning to do that rather than going through all this. But nonetheless, I enjoyed the walk down memory lane. Thanks for joining me this week and every week. If you keep listening, I’ll keep recording these. My eighth prediction for 2024 is that I’ll ship 52 episodes of this podcast to you this year.

As I talk about in the episode, SignWell is an electronic signature app that’s growing quickly, he’s having a lot of success with it. But in this episode we talk about product market fit, and maybe some of the myths around it, or the oversimplifications that we use when we talk about it. And I really like the way Ruben thinks about everything he talks about on a day-to-day basis, but especially things like product market fit. That kicks off the conversation, and I think you’ll find it enlightening if you’ve never experienced it, or if you’ve never thought about it in the way that Ruben talks about. Then we talk about doing sales as an introvert, because I get that question on the podcast a lot. Then we dig into decision making, that was an audible, that just came up in the middle of the episode, but I let this one run long because I really enjoyed that piece of it, and I think it’s something that more founders can learn from, and it’s not something that I’ve talked about much on the podcast in the past. And finally, we talk about hiring, getting good at it, why Ruben is so good at it, and why he has a high hit rate, and has built teams that get stuff done without a lot of drama. Do you want to reach tens of thousands of potential customers? Between our MicroConf events, Startups for the Rest of Us, our YouTube channel, our email newsletter, and all the other ways we interact with our large and growing and loyal audience of startup founders, we have a lot of options for you to reach B2B SaaS founders with your product or service. Drop us an email at sponsors@microconf.com. And one more thing. We’ve recently reopened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other, and discussing wins, challenges, and frankly, how to grow faster. A couple months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your requests. With MicroConf Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks, like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library, and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out, microconfconnect.com. And with that, let’s dive into our conversation. Ruben Gamez, thanks so much for joining me again.  Ruben Gamez:Hey, thanks for the invite. Good to be back.  Rob Walling:Yeah, back by popular demand. I’m really on a roll here, I had Asia Orangio on a few weeks ago, plan to have Derrick Reimer on in a couple weeks, and Ruben Gamez, I believe the three of you tend to be the most requested guests on this show.  Ruben Gamez:Nice.  Rob Walling:So, glad you took time here in the new year to hang out with me. In the last several times you’ve come on, we’ve answered listener questions, and obviously there’s plenty in the mailbag, so to speak, but I really wanted to have you talk about some learnings that you’ve had over the past year or two, and catch people up. It’s been a while since we’ve just riffed on things. In the past, you and I have talked about product market fit, about rules of thumb, about funnel metrics, about sale… All kinds of stuff. And you and I chat fairly regularly, once a month, and have for years. And so, I have some idea of what you’ve been going through, and I feel like your learnings, and the way… Not just your learnings, it’s the way you communicate them, is very unique in our space. And I sent a tweet out the other day, someone was saying, maybe you should have Ruben back on the show, or they were just saying, Ruben is the goat. And I said, yeah, his doing to talking about it ratio is like 10 to one, right? It’s like 10 x what everyone else on the internet is. And so, that’s why I want to just take the whole episode today to talk through product market fit, is one thing, and we’re going to talk about how product market fit is not as simple as we all make it out to be. That almost every conversation around it, including a lot of stuff I say on the show is it isn’t abstraction, it’s an oversimplification. And I want to take the first part to dig into that. And then, I want to talk about, you’re a developer, an introverted developer, for that matter, but you’ve done a lot of sales calls, and you’ve closed big deals. And I want to hear how you’ve done that, and how you’ve thought about it, as well as building your sales team. And you’re one of the most gifted bootstrap founders I know at building a team. At hiring in a very, I’m going to say picky, and I mean that as a compliment. You’re a good judge of people, and you have a high hit rate, a high rate of hiring people who work out. And when people don’t work out, you let them go. And those are unusual skills, I will say, in the bootstrap space. So, sound good?  Ruben Gamez:Yep, sounds good.  Rob Walling:Let’s dive in, man. So, first point is going to be around product market fit, but I think the overarching topic really that you said is, the whole goal of what you’ve been working on for the past year with product and positioning and all this stuff is increasing your average revenue per customer. And to catch people up, you run SignWell, signwell.com, which is an electronic signature platform, and you have both the web app side and the API side. And so, I guess the first question is, okay, so you’re trying to increase average revenue per customer. Why?  Ruben Gamez:Oh, good question. Because, generally speaking, customers that pay more, churn less. It’s easier to grow, it’s easier to grow faster that way, you just need a lot less customers. And depending on the category, it can actually be less competitive. In our category, it tends to be less competitive because we deal with e-signatures and e-sign laws, and once you start to go up the market, there’s more on the compliance and security side. So, there are less companies, the bar is higher, which means the competitive set, when companies are in that group where they need to work with a company that has these things, is just smaller. So, for all those reasons are why we’re focusing on customers with, they’re going to move that up for us.  Rob Walling:And to be clear, we’re going to call the user facing interface, your web app, and then the API is, people know the difference between those two. So, there’s two separate offerings, and your pricing is very different for them. So, the web app, you have a free plan, you have a personal plan that’s $8 a month if paid annually, and a business plan, $24 a month if paid annually. So, these are relatively low price points. Versus on the API side… We’re not talking about you raising prices five or $10 a month. We’re talking about several hundred if not thousands, literally thousands a month on the API side.  Ruben Gamez:Yes. Also, even on the web app side, on that side of things, we’re just selling to larger teams. So, even though the per user price is smaller, we’re bringing in companies that are… More and more companies that are in the 50, 70, 100, 200 user price point.  Rob Walling:Got it. And this is what I want to talk about, because you said this right before we hit record, and it’s something that I don’t think is talked about at all, about product market fit specifically. And you said, yeah, we found product market fit or strong product market fit, because you and I both know it’s not a binary, it’s a continuum. I like to think of it as a number of one to a hundred, or zero to a hundred, or whatever. And you mentioned that with the web app, we found product market fit a while ago with individuals, but we didn’t have it with teams. With 50, 60, 70, 100 person teams, we just didn’t have the features. So then you were looking for product market fit on the web app team side, the enterprise side, and then you moved over to the API, which does even bigger deals, and you realize, oh, there’s not just one product market fit continuum, there’s all these different use cases. And with each individual one, we have to then go find it. So, we’re going to talk through each of those mental models, or each of those phases, but to kick us off in true Startups For the Rest of Us fashion, I want to ask you, when did you know on the web app side that you had product market fit?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. For us, it became… All the numbers just started to look different at some point. Our conversion numbers improved, our retention numbers, churn was lower, and growth… Ultimately, really what you’re looking for, and what you’re looking at is growth and word of mouth to pick up in a way to where it feels like, we’ve talked about this before, but you’re being pulled. And more, it started for us to feel like we’re having to keep up instead of having to grind and work and push. The feeling was different from that side of things, and this is just broadly talking about it. But it was generalizing it was just more for the segment to where it’s self-serve, it’s smaller, it’s like one person, or just a couple, two or three, and we serve those really, really, really well. It was still not that great of a solution for teams, for even 10, 15, 20 person teams, and that was pretty rough. So, not just that, but even on the smaller side, this is the thing with the horizontal product, it’s hard to… You’re just serving so many different industries that if you look and you say, okay, what are our top 10 best customers? We want more of those. You start to break them down. One of the easier things to do with some products is that you could just put them on a spreadsheet by revenue, and then you start to see, okay, so these are all this industry, or this vertical, or whatever, this customer segment. For a horizontal product, a lot of times it just looks like it’s all over the place. It’s like you might have accounting firms here, and then education, nonprofits and all sorts of different industries, so it can be hard to work with if you’re looking at it from that perspective. So then, we really started focusing on use cases, and you’ll find that, oh, education and HR, internal corporate, have this use case of they need to send one document to many people, they batch documents. So then, you can group industries that way. That’s how we look at our top customers by use case, even our bottom customers, performing an audit. What are the worst performing? Which ones use it the most frequently, but also the least frequently? And what percentage of the bottom, of the worst performing, make up our revenue? So, just to get a feel for are we adding features that are really meant for that bottom tier, or are we moving in the right direction?  Rob Walling:Yeah. And what I want to call out here is, the oversimplification that I was referring to, that I think everyone’s guilty of, and certainly me on this podcast is… Well, I should say, the most common oversimplification is acting like product market fit is binary. I have it, or I don’t, and it’s just has never been my experience, it’s not how it works. But let’s say it’s a continuum, the way that I like about how you described it is even with that, it’s a different product market fit with individual customer segments. And that customer segment might be a vertical, it might be hair salons versus realtors versus bankers versus SaaS founders. But as you said, when you’re a horizontal SaaS it’s oftentimes, the verticals, it’s not verticals, it’s use cases. It’s HR, as you said, HR teams at almost any company that’s 100, 200, 300 people might have the same use case, it doesn’t matter what vertical they’re in, because they all have the same need to hire people and send out things in bulk. And that’s something I think is undercommunicated, or just isn’t talked about enough in our space.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. I think use cases are a big deal. They matter for not just product market fit and figuring out what features to build, but also who to go after, how to do even your onboarding and what that first run experience is like. Because if you think about it, we have use cases to where some industries just have more of a sales type use case, to where it’s simple documents, they just need signatures and that’s it. And the time to value for those is really fast. So, that means they also do one-off documents, and maybe in high frequency or whatever. And that just looks very different from an onboarding perspective, from a sales perspective, from the features that you’re going to build point of view, compared to ones where maybe they’re collecting a lot of data, maybe in the government forms, HR stuff. So then, if you think about the time to value, that’s longer because they have to set up documents with all these fields, they have to set up templates, they have to maybe do a bunch of training and all this stuff. And that also tends to change how we reach them and how we sell to them.  Rob Walling:And then you mentioned on the API side, which is a much higher ticket sale, so to speak, just higher annual contract values, that even on that side there are multiple use cases and you had to work on them in order, individually. Talk about patience. This is where folks either who have never started a SaaS, don’t realize how long it takes and how patient you have to be, or people who are working on a SaaS, and are like, but I’ve been coding for months and we’re just not going to get there. It is taking longer than [inaudible 00:13:49]. It always takes way, way longer than you thought. Because you think that you understand this full view, and usually, once you get to the top of that little summit, which is I’ll say product market fit with one use case, you realize, oh, there’s four others that I now have to build and it’s different features, and each one is a few months, so I’m talking eight months of… Or whatever, I’m making up numbers. But that’s usually how it feels. But the other thing you said was the further up market you move, the fewer prospects you have, the fewer customers you have, the less data you have to work with to make these hard decisions with incomplete information. So my question, because I get this a lot on the podcast, is how do you make those decisions? It’s not like it’s super clear cut. In retrospect, when the biopic is made about you and SignWell, and Aaron Sorkin’s going to write it, in retrospect, it’s going to be so clear that from day one you knew the exact vision and where you were headed.  Ruben Gamez:But yeah, looking back, it’s always super clear.  Rob Walling:It is. So, what is it? How are you making… You’re in the midst of this. How are you making those decisions these days?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. So, you are working with less data, typically the more you charge, that’s just the game. So, because of that, you have to go deeper with each of these customers, and understand them at a… You have the time and you don’t have a lot of data by volume, but you can get a lot of data by depth.  Rob Walling:Qualitative versus quantitative, right?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, exactly. Right. And you do qualitative even with volume, but a little bit less. And you’re just depending on the numbers being so high for you to understand the full picture, but you don’t have that. So, you have to talk to customers, and you have to sell, and you have to do… Every time you’re interacting with a company, you have to try and gather data that will help you in this journey. And then afterwards, after you sell them, not be afraid to come back and be like, I’ve done this on the API side and with teams, with companies that we don’t have a lot of, but we know this is a good customer and we want more of. And it’s just, we need to understand as much as possible about this customer, how they buy, what triggered the process of buying? Who was involved? What were the conversations like behind the scenes? What are the things that are important to them? What were they worried about when getting started? All this stuff. And the more you know that way, the less people you need before you start to see patterns. You still are, it’s not going to be perfectly clear or anything like that, but that helps a lot.  Rob Walling:And so, you take this qualitative data, and at a certain point you just have to go with your gut?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. So, part of it is where you want to go with the company, and what you see. Because you just have to think about, okay, we like this type of company, how many more are there out there? And the thing that I think a lot of people miss is, oh, what can we… So, everyone focuses on what they can build. It’s like how long is it going to take to add these features, and will there be more companies that will use these features? How big of a market is it? And the thing that I think a lot of companies overlook is that they don’t think about how easily they can reach them. How good are they at selling to them? You can have a really big market. So, for us, an example is real estate. And this was early on, we saw, okay, this use case has more of a back and forth than some of the other use cases. So, this back and forth is good for real estate and a couple other industries, but not many. That market is really big. There are e-sign companies that are just real estate. And looking into it, and researching it, there were things that I found that I felt made it harder for us to reach them and sell to them. And it’s not necessarily just a general thing, these are hard to… Sometimes it’s like that, like, oh, they don’t like to talk to sales, and they don’t hang out online, and all this stuff. But none of that matters if you have a way to reach them, like, well, we have good relationships with these organizations, or a superpower for us and our company DNA is doing this, which is a really good way of reaching. We didn’t have any of that. So, because of that, plus we were lacking just expertise when it comes to how to sell to real estate, and how all that works, it didn’t feel like a good… And we purposely ignored building those features. And we still have a good amount of real estate customers, but there’s a lot more that we can do to better serve that. And we don’t have product market fit for that segment, those types of back and forth use cases.  Rob Walling:And you’re just willing to do it.  Ruben Gamez:And we’re okay. You have to decide, right? Prioritizing is a huge part of it. There’s only so much you can do, you have to pick and you have to decide what you’re doing. But also, what you’re not going to do.  Rob Walling:That’s the big conversation. And I don’t like it when people use Steve Jobs and Basecamp as examples, Apple and Basecamp. But there is a quote that I like from Steve Jobs, where, I believe he told it… It’s Tim Cook quoting Steve Jobs. And he said, one of the things he told me is, “There will always be 1000 good ideas, and usually we have time to pursue one.” And so for every 100 or 1000, or whatever the number is, we have to say no. And we will be great by saying no to a lot of things. And that’s prioritization. Maybe he’s overstating it, maybe he’s exaggerating, you can do more than one thing. But the reality is, in the final days of Drip when I was there, we’re doing tens of millions a year in revenue, team is 125 people or so, we were getting close to… I think it was about 175, 200 feature requests per month. How many can you… Even with 18 engineers?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, you’re not going to do all that. Right. No, you have to find a way to prioritize. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Exactly. And some of it, and some people prioritize with a spreadsheet, and some people like Derrick and I, and I think you prioritize, I would say it’s gut feel that acts I’m just either smarter than I am, or I just don’t give a (censored), and I’m just picking (censored) randomly with a dartboard. It’s neither of those. It is this, there’s an intuitive side, there’s a right and a left brain, a creative and a science side. And the spreadsheet is science, and that’s helpful. And so, when we hired the first product person, aside from Derrick and I, he was very much in that left brain spreadsheet mode, and that balanced us out a bit, I will say. It was helpful to have that voice on the product side, but that voice alone would not have made the right decisions.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, gut’s a really big part of it. I always felt like you’re really good at this, and you’re decisive, and you tend to more often make, from what I’ve seen, make the right decisions. Not always, but a lot of the time. More than a lot of other people. One thing that I’ve wondered about the way that you do it is, do you feel like you’ve developed that, or are there things that you’ve done or that you do that you think help improve that gut feel?  Rob Walling:This is a really good question, and I’ve thought a lot about it, because one of the talks that I’ve given is… I forget exactly the title, but I gave it in South Dakota a few months ago. And it’s nine traits of the best startup founders. And I couch it in the first five minutes of, here’s what I define as best. I’ve invested 171 companies, I have pretty in-depth data about 171 SaaS founders. And I can tell when the founders are having an outsized impact. It’s not just you’re successful, because sometimes you’re successful and you got really lucky and it’s not actually the founder. You and I have seen that. But given the relationship I have with the TinySeed founders in my private investments, I have patterns, there’s pattern matching that I see across my… There’s a framework I have of it. And one of those things is they generally tend to make the right decision more often than not. And, as you said, it’s not 100%, but it’s somewhere in the 60 to 80% range I think. You can be as low as 50 and it’s still probably not that bad. This is Rob popping in a day or two after Ruben and I recorded this episode, and I thought back to that statement that I just said, about how if you’re making 50% of your decisions correct or right or mostly right that you’re doing well, and I disagree with that. That number is too low. That’s basically like flipping a coin. As I thought more about it, I think if you’re above two thirds, maybe 70%, 75%, you’re doing pretty good. And I think the better you get at this, I think really experienced founders who know what they’re doing are probably in the 80 plus, 85, 90 plus. It’s like eight or nine out of 10 are at least in the ballpark. And as Ruben and I talk about measuring right or wrong can often be hard, it’s usually not just two choices, there’s creative choices, and oftentimes there’s 6, 7, 8 different paths, and you don’t know how they all would’ve panned out, and multiple options can be “right” or turn out poorly or whatever. So, it is all a bit hand wavy and fuzzy, but I just didn’t want to leave it on record that I said, oh, if you’re a founder making 50% or more of your choices, that you know how to make good decisions, because I don’t believe that’s the case. And now, let’s get back to the episode. I often list several founders off the top of my head who I think are really gifted founders, and are really good at it, and could do it over and over, and it’s Hiten Shah, it’s Jason Cohen, it’s Steli Efti, so there’s a bunch of folks who’ve been MicroConf speakers. They just tend to make the right decisions. And so, I’ve thought a lot about, well, how do you get better at that? Because it feels like this very intuitive thing, but I used to not be good at it, and I used to second guess myself a lot. And I think the ways I got better at it were by talking to people, either having advisors or having mastermind compadres, like yourself, who think about things differently than I do, and who make decisions differently. I used to make impulsive decisions quickly. You think a lot more in depth about decisions. And that steered me into balancing. What’s my weakness? I know myself to know, oh, a weakness is I’m uncertain, I’m not decisive, I think about things too much, and then eventually I just (censored), I’m just going to make an impulsive decision. That’s how I used to do it, say 15 years ago or more. And you balance me out. Just watching Hiten Shah execute, he was an early influence on me because he was a MicroConf speaker, and he was ahead of us, in terms of Crazy Egg, and just with KISSmetrics. Watching Jason Cohen execute. So, some of it I could do from afar, because Jason Cohen and I, we’ve done Zoom calls over the years, but it’s not like we talk every month. But you just observe him, and you read his blogs, you hear him talk about his decision-making. And it’s like, I want to be more like that, he seems to make some good decisions, and being-  Ruben Gamez:Some pretty good decisions, yeah.  Rob Walling:And being around you on a more ongoing basis, again, we have that monthly touchpoint for more than a decade, that also helped. And then, here’s what the interesting thing, even with TinySeed founders today, watching founders, there are a lot of founders that I work with, and I’m like, wow, you make really good decisions, and I’m still learning from them. They might be better at me than making decisions. And so, I pick up on little things… I’ll say, explain to me why you made that decision. And when I hear them talk it through, I’m like, ooh, that’s smart. That’s a neat framework, or a neat way of thinking about it. So, that’s the answer. The answer is I do believe you can develop this, because I certainly didn’t have it, and I would agree with you, these days, I do have it. And that’s not overconfidence, it’s I generally make the right decisions. So, I definitely think you can learn it, but I do not believe you can learn it in a vacuum. I think you need to be listening to the right people. And by listening to… Do they have a podcast? Or can you read Jason Cohen’s blog? Can you read my book, the SaaS Playbook? Hopefully I help you make some decisions. I have a thing in there about risk versus certainty and decision making. It’s like, are they putting stuff on the internet in a way that you can follow them, or do you know them personally? I know you [inaudible 00:25:51], that’s actually really good at making decisions, and I’ve learned from him even in the past five years of working together. So, does that all make sense? And does that align with your… Because I feel like you’ve always been pretty good at making these types of decisions, to be honest. But do you feel like you’ve learned it, or got better at it, or was it a natural thing?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, what you said I think makes a lot of sense, and there’s a lot of overlap with how maybe I think about it. I’ve studied, of course, just decision-making, and things you could do to make better decisions. But being exposed to ideas from others that may be different, observing people that are making good decisions, and trying to at least consider and analyze that a little bit about why did they do this? And knowing yourself I think is a big one too. A lot of this stuff is really about just getting out of our own way. Knowing what we tend to do that messes us up, and then counteracting that, and however you need to do that. I think that’s huge. And then, being truly open to-  Rob Walling:To learning and getting feedback?  Ruben Gamez:Yes, yes.  Rob Walling:To asking, if I’m making a decision and I say, hey, five smart people I know, tell me what you think about this decision? And they all tell you the same thing. And then you say, oh, I’m going to do what I thought originally anyways, that doesn’t help you.  Ruben Gamez:No, no. Right. There are people, and we see them sometimes, there are people that ask for feedback, or put things out on Twitter or whatever, seemingly to get feedback, but not really. People give them feedback, and if they don’t like it, if it doesn’t align with what they’re thinking, they shut it down. You can’t get good that way, you can’t get better, you can’t improve in that way.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I like that. That’s a good way to think about it. So, I want to switch up topics and talk about sales as an introvert. Because you have had to do a lot of sales calls as you’ve moved into this upmarket position, especially on the API side, I’m assuming on the web app side too. A question I get now and again is, I’m introverted, and I don’t really want to do sales, but I have to do sales, how do you do it? Or should I just not? Should I automate everything? You and I stand the same on this. You do what it takes.  Ruben Gamez:Right.  Rob Walling:If I want to build a multimillion-dollar company, if I want to have an eight figure exit, I’m going to do what it takes whether I want to or not. And so, I don’t like sales, I’m not a good salesperson, I’m introverted as well. I don’t like talking to people I don’t know, Ruben. I have a small circle of friends. And so, how have you gotten over that?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, there are just things that you do because you have to do to move things forward, and they tend to be easier if you know that they’re not going to be permanent things. You’re doing them to get to a place where you can bring on somebody who will do that, who truly enjoys doing that. So, sales for me is, I can kind of enjoy at times, or parts of it, and I can see how people can be so into it that that’s what they want to do for a living. I don’t want to do that for a living, it doesn’t give me energy, it’s one of these things that takes energy away from me, to where I need to recharge afterwards. Being that it’s important for the things that I want to do with the business, I’ve just made it an effort to learn how to do it better, and I’ve put myself in situations to where I’ve had to practice it. So, that’s another part. And then, I’ve just talked to other… Same process that I do for anything else that’s new that I’m trying to understand and learn and get better, practice taking in information and then talking to people who are doing it, and learning from others. So, learning from Jordan Gaul, who’s doing a lot of that, I’ve learned a lot from him. Matt Wensing, who’s really, really good at it, and has given me some great tips and advice in the middle of negotiations and all that. And even hiring expertise, and we have a sales advisor that worked in our industry and did exactly the stuff that we want to do, that I’ve hired to help us out and give us advice on this. Yeah, those are the things that I’ve done to help.  Rob Walling:So, it’s valuing the business… Not even valuing, but prioritizing the business or the growth over your personal preference of what you want to do. And it’s not what you want to do eight hours a day, 365 days a year. It’s, now and again, I have to do a sales call, and I don’t particularly want to do it. But I’m going to grind it for now, knowing that I’m going to hire this out eventually. But right now it really needs a founder. And then taking information in and iterating, and getting good enough at it… I don’t think you’d call yourself an amazing salesperson, would be my guess. But you’re good enough.  Ruben Gamez:Exactly. And I think, even for things like this, to where it’s not my favorite thing in the world to do, I think it really matters, the energy that you come at these things with. It really does. If you’re going into it just dreading it, and thinking about how much it sucks, and all this stuff, then it’s going to be rough. It doesn’t have to be that way. So, I tend to think about things at a higher level in the way where I’m not thinking maybe so much about the specific sales conversations and the tactical stuff. If I’m thinking about the type of energy that I want to bring into something, so I’m not all pissed off and dreading it, I’m thinking about it being a puzzle. All this stuff, these are puzzles. And I love figuring things out, and it’s about figuring this out, and figuring these things out. So, there was something I read recently, they were talking about… I don’t remember where it was, maybe it was a podcast. But I like the way that they phrased it, to where they’re saying, once you’ve made the decision, go all in, and go into it with a positive energy and attitude as much as you can. It makes no sense making the decision and then afterwards just trying to fight it. If you’ve decided you’ve decided to do this thing.  Rob Walling:Then do it. Stop waffling.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Go in.  Ruben Gamez:Yep. Exactly.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And I like what you said right before that, essentially gamifying it. To you, it’s like, huh, I don’t like sales, but you know what I do like? I like my MRR going up. I like having a challenge that I really am not good at, and that I’m going to be good at in a week, or a month, or six months. And I’ve often thought about building businesses like that. I built several businesses, pre-Drip that I kind of didn’t care about. I had these little, you remember, little eBooks about bonsai trees. Or I’m trying to think… I had duck boat plans, where you could build your own duck boat. And it’s like, they were quality things that I stood behind, I wasn’t just shilling crap. But I liked the product, I wasn’t passionate about the product or the niche, but I gamified it in the sense of how high can I rank in Google for all the terms? How fast can this grow? And it wasn’t… One of them did $500 a month, it wasn’t even MRR, it was just in sales of this $30 ebook. But it was still this fun challenge that I could work on. And I was learning, and if I screwed up with those, screwed up and Google booted it out, it didn’t matter. But it was still a fun challenge.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. There were legitimately fun things about those.  Rob Walling:Yep. So, I want to mix it up and talk about hiring and firing. And really, I think the overarching thing is building a team and building a functional team that gets (censored) done, and that I never hear an excuse from you, of like, yeah, I don’t know, there just aren’t any good developers out there. Or, my team’s really dragging us… We’re not making progress because of my team. You just never say that. Because I think you tend to be pretty picky about who you hire, I think you tend to fire pretty fast, and somehow you find… Even during COVID where we were at, bootstrappers were at a disadvantage again, because everyone was remote, and usually being remote is this big advantage. Even during COVID, you still kept making forward progress. So, what is your mental model around this? Why are you… Again, I was telling you offline, you’re probably in the top 10, 15% of all the bootstrap founders I know, in terms of hiring, firing, motivating, building a team, basically the overarching thing of your team. It’s not just software, it’s the whole team. They just get (censored) done, you have good people who are competent, who are doing customer success and support and all this stuff. And a lot of founders struggle with this, and I don’t know, it’s like, Ruben, are you a natural at this? Or do you just have a framework or two that you think could help a listener who might have no idea what they’re doing?  Ruben Gamez:So, I didn’t know that I was as picky… I felt like, I’m a little picky, but I didn’t realize maybe how much more picky I was than the average founder hiring, or company hiring. Until recently, where I was working with Dynamite Jobs, I think, is that what they’re called? I’m not sure.  Rob Walling:Yeah, they’re called Remote First Recruiting now. Yeah, it’s Dan and Ian from Tropical MBA. We use them at TinySeed and MicroConf as well, to help hire.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. And they do a good job of putting the job descriptions out there, and taking calls, and doing an initial interview and then sending you people that they think are good and qualified, and getting feedback if that needs an adjustment, and then sending you more people. It was something they said to where we, we were at about person 15 or something like that that they had sent, and Krista who had been working with on that, I don’t remember what I asked, but she said something like, well, actually, typically we send about three to four people before a hire is generally made. I was like, really?After the second, third, fourth person, that’s it? I feel like people are maybe a little bit too quick to hire, and maybe some of that comes from, we really need somebody and we need to fill that role. There’s some pain there. And not being willing to just wait to find the right person. I think that’s part of it. Also, when you’re hiring for a new position or something new, I tend to do the same thing for sales. Sales advisors are very involved in helping hire this person, helping… I don’t have the experience to have the gut feel yet for this being a really good person for this type of position. In certain ways. I understand if somebody’s well organized, and they have good attitude, and all this stuff, but there’s some gaps there, and I think it’s important to fill those gaps with help and expertise when you can. And then, I do follow, I like the book, Who: The A Method for Hiring, something like that, to where it’s a very specific process, to where part of it is, beforehand, I think an important thing that maybe some people skip out on is identifying what makes a great hire, and going down the list of the things that you’re really looking for, and then when you’re interviewing people, scoring them, they call it a scorecard, against each of these things. If it’s selling, their ability to follow up, their expertise with selling to the mid-market or enterprise or whatever, what people tend to do is, they’ll get somebody that they really like, and they think is really good, but maybe they’re not as good in the areas that they thought initially going into the whole process, that they needed, and they end up hiring this person, and then it doesn’t work out. Because it’s not… They just feel like, oh, this person’s a really good… And you’ll hear this sometimes, if you come across a really good person, then just hire them. But when you’re a small company, you do tend to have very specific needs, and there is less room for that. That, and then, one of the other things, even with hiring contractors agencies and things like this, I tend to keep track of companies… No, I should say, of people, that I think are really smart and good and doing interesting things. And I do that, often, I see them on Twitter or something like that, and so I literally have a bookmark for freelancers, writers, or marketers. And this is just random people that I think are really smart, doing super interesting things, that might be working at a company, might be working for an agency, might be freelancing, might be whatever, that I might at some point in the future want to work with. Maybe an external agency or something that can help us with things, or if they start something like that, or a freelancer, or hire them. Hey, this person, if they become available, and we’re looking for this type of position, they would probably be pretty good. I think it’s helpful, I’ll say, to always do that, even if you’re not hiring for that specific thing.  Rob Walling:Right, you’re just paying attention because you know that you’re going to grow.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah.  Rob Walling:It’s interesting what you say about being picky, because I used to be accused of that as well when I was a development manager at a credit card company. We’d hire these contingency recruiters that make an egregious percentage of the first year salary, 15% or something of 100, at the time, 120, $130,000 salary. But they only do it if you hire them. So, there was all this pressure on us, and the recruiters would get so mad, and they’d be like, what are you looking for? Can I see your resume? Do you have the stuff you’re asking for? And I was like, no, you can’t, A… And my boss got super mad when they asked to see my resume. But I said, no, I’m just not going to hire someone who’s not a fit.  Ruben Gamez:That’s funny.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And the thing I think about… Maybe I should write this out at some point. But when I think of… You were talking about evaluating someone. Let’s say I’m going to hire a designer. If I simplify it, there’s three skills a designer needs. This is oversimplification. But they need the actual design skills, the chops to do it. And whether I’m going to hire or just for a one-off job, are they a good designer? And you know how I can evaluate that? It’s easy. Go look at the (censored) designs.  Ruben Gamez:Their work.  Rob Walling:Yeah, just look at the work portfolio. So, designers are actually, in my opinion, easy to evaluate, because I can look and say, I like that, or I don’t. I think they’re skilled or they’re not. That’s the easy part. But there’s two other factors that are hard to evaluate. The first one, I guess it’s the second one of my three, is communication. Do they take feedback and iterate well? Do they communicate with you and say, oh, I’m going to be late, or… Whatever. Are you able to have a back and forth with them in a way that the two of you understand each other? So, communication, and that’s what I’m going after in an interview. I’m trying to suss out, I know what your skill is, I can see your design. So, I’m trying to figure out, can you communicate, let’s talk about some complex topics, and figure out if we’re on the same page. And the third one, I’ll just say, do they deliver? Meaning can they hit deadlines? That one is the hardest of the three to figure out.  Ruben Gamez:That is, yep.  Rob Walling:Because you can’t figure that out by asking them a question. It has to be either references, or maybe you ask, hey, when was the time you didn’t hit a deadline, how did that play out? And listen to how they talk about it. And if they’re like, oh man, it was two years ago that I totally missed a deadline, and here’s what I did. Or if they’re like, oh yeah, so a couple of weeks ago I did this. It’s like, huh? But even that’s not 100%. It’s just, we are trying to evaluate. And if anything of when I’m hiring designers, usually the thing that I miss is that they don’t hit the deadlines and they’re unreliable, because that is the… I just know there’s uncertainty in that. And it’s hard in an interview process, until I work with them, figuring that out. Similar, let’s say we’re hiring a customer support, email support rep, for a SaaS company. Again, I think there’s about three things. One is communication, for sure. Can they type the email or the live chat [inaudible 00:41:48]? Second is, will they get the understanding of your customer and your product? I think that’s the second thing. Can they [inaudible 00:41:55] that and get it all in their head? And the third one then I think is speed. Does it take them five minutes or 50 minutes to write this email? If I gave more thought to it, maybe I would pick different ones. But I think those are the three. Now, can I figure out communication? Probably. I could probably email them with them, I can talk with them during an interview. Can I figure out whether they’re going to understand my customer and my product? That one’s tough. I would do it on a sample project.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. We have an application… We hired for that. We have an application for that. To where, sign for the product, do this task, upload a document, all this stuff, and then fill out this form that has these questions, from real customers that we’ve asked, to where they don’t know the product that well, but they have to answer the questions, and see if they can find the right answers, or understand, a lot of it is about understanding what’s coming at them.  Rob Walling:Yep. So, all that to say is, without those mental models or without any experience hiring, I think people… I’ve heard this phrase used of, resume and small talk. Where, I get on an interview with anybody, developer, designer, support person, and I’m looking at their resume, saying, oh, they worked at Google, they worked at Facebook, they must be really good at the… No, don’t do that. Or they were there seven years and they became a senior, blah, blah, blah. It’s like, so? I worked at a ton of companies with (censored) people, with dummies that rose to senior manager.  Ruben Gamez:Right, yeah.  Rob Walling:Don’t use that. That is one of the least important things. I look at tenure, I look at some experience, blah, blah, blah. But I’m trying to get into nitty-gritty, and ask them, I won’t even say hard questions, but just questions that actually get to the root of, what are the skills that they need to succeed at my company? Because guess what skill they don’t need? The ability to work at Facebook for three years is not a skill you need to work for me.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, no, that’s a good point. There is generally some sort of exercise to try and evaluate the quality of the work. And depending on the position, you can, on the design side, you can tell, on the development side, even on that side, we do have people that go through a four-hour coding exercise and all that stuff. And that’s been, we’ve improved that to where it tells us pretty well where they are on at least the code quality point of view. So, that helps. And if you can work with them, of course, on a smart project or something like that, that’s the best, then you know. But that’s not always going to be the case. But, like I said, we hired both a developer recently that did that, and then on the customer success side, also for support, we’re having a lot of people just not being able to understand, or understanding but missing little details that matter and that result in a bad support experience, because somebody’s… It’s like, wait a minute, you’re not… And we’ve all gotten this, to where we send in the support, and then they just send in a copy and pasted reply, or link to support article, and you’re like, no, you’re not really answering my question. Yeah, that’s a big part of it, and then in the communication part, that’s partly why we have everyone write, in their application, we have them write why they were interested in the position, all the basic stuff, and then just get a feel for their writing and their communication. Generally, even in the exercise, there’s a feedback and improvement part. Can you change something? And this is about seeing if they’re open to criticism, and if they’re open to write some pushback and all that. And it’s not super strong, but you’d be surprised at how many people are just… The way that they take… It doesn’t have to be super obvious, it can be subtle, to where were like, ah, okay, there’s something there.  Rob Walling:There’s something there. Yep. And there are skills, like you’re saying, that are easier to evaluate, like communication, or response time, or understanding. And there are certain skills that in any role are just harder. They’re just harder. Like hitting deadlines and this and that. It’s like, I can’t figure that out in a interview, I need to do a sample project. And I think having that dichotomy or whatever it is, that mental framework in your mind as you go into interviews, I think can be helpful. Because I’m going to check the boxes for the ones that I can evaluate, and then the other one I’m looking out, this is why people do trials, 30-day trial, or a single project trial, if it’s project-based, to try to suss out that other one or two. And if there’s any wavering, you just cut bait.  Ruben Gamez:You know what’s pretty good, surprisingly good too? Is the question where I’m asking… You ask everyone what are you not good at, or what do you want to improve, and all that stuff. And they’re all like, oh, I’m too much of a perfectionist and blah, blah, blah. And then, the one where you’re asking about specific jobs, and who they work with, and if I ask, who did you report to at that place, at the job? Okay, so I ask so-and-so what they thought was something that… If I asked them, what’s something that they could improve in? What’s an area that they could work on? What do you think that person will…  Rob Walling:Right. So, your former boss.  Ruben Gamez:Yes.  Rob Walling:What would your former boss say that you could improve about yourself?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. Being specific at each one of the jobs. It actually works really, really, really well. Sometimes you’ll get pushback toward, oh, I don’t know what they would say, and then at that point, it’s like, they don’t want to say anything bad, but I say, sure, I get that. But somebody like Christian on my team, he’s our lead dev, he’s great, but he also wants to know how he can get better. So, I go out of my way to let him know, because nobody’s perfect, how he can improve. So, what would they say, in your opinion, that would be… And usually though they know, because those conversations have been had, so then when they say the thing, it’s like, oh, can you give me an example of that? And it’ll usually come up like, yeah, it came up because of… And these types of things will give you clues into their strengths, and maybe the areas where they’re not so good.  Rob Walling:Right,. And another point you just made, without even making it overtly, is sometimes you have to ask a question two or three times. Sometimes you have to push a little bit. You don’t have to be a jerk, but I ask some hard questions, very tactfully of people. I’m the guy in our TinySeed interviews, it’s like, so I can see your churn is 12% per month, I’d imagine you want that to be quite a bit better, because that’s not good? Or talk to me about why it’s there. Talk to me about how you thought… So, basically, I could have said, your churn is (censored) catastrophic and your business is on fire, why haven’t you fixed it? That’s one way to ask it. Or you can ask it the way I just did. So asking… So you don’t have to phrase things like a jerk in order to ask hard questions. And that’s actually, Crucial Conversations is a book that you recommended to me years ago, and I learned a bit about phrasing and all that from there.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. No. And coming at it… That’s a good point. Coming at it multiple ways, because people will try to give you fluffy answers. It’s like, oh, so for this project, give me an example of this, what happened? What was something that where you ran into… What was a tough time at the company or whatever? It’s like, oh, blah, blah, blah, so and so, we had a problem with whatever. And it’ll be very fluffy. It’s like, oh, tell me about that. And then they’ll kind of tell you, but it’ll still be high level. It’s like, yeah, I wanted to understand what happened there, tell me about your thinking. What kicked it off? And you sometimes have to push a little and just keep asking.  Rob Walling:Ruben Gamez, you are earthlingworks on Twitter, everyone should rush over and follow him there.

Today I’m joined by fan favorite, Asia Orangio. She and I answer listener questions ranging from finding your ideal customer, moving from B to C, to B to B, and several other topics related to bootstrapping, and mostly bootstrapping startups. We’ve continued to have a great stream of incoming listener questions. As always, audio and video go to the top of the stack, but I am getting through a lot of the written questions as well. So head to startupsfortherestofus.com, click Ask a Question in the top nav from your mobile device or your desktop, and send us a question. If you want to hear me or me and a guest discuss it on the show. Before we dive into that, we are running the next edition of the State of Independent SaaS Survey and Report. Through MicroConf, we’ve run the survey a couple of times, and then we decided to take last year off, because the information coming through wasn’t changing. The survey is about 40 questions. It takes less than 10 minutes to complete if you have your metrics handy. And then we take that data from what usually winds up being between 600 and 1,000 independent SaaS companies. These are bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies. And we compile a report with all the key findings and helpful industry benchmarks that you don’t get anywhere else. The survey closes soon, we could really use your input. All the data is kept anonymous, and every survey response we get, makes the report that much better. Head to stateofindiesaas.com to complete the survey, and we’re going to enter everyone who completes a survey, into a drawing for a free ticket to MicroConf US 2024, in Atlanta. That’s more than a $1,000 value. I know it’s a lot for me to ask you for 10 minutes out of your busy day, but it really would go a long way towards making this year’s report, the best yet. We are mixing it up this year, asking different questions, and pulling out different findings than you’ve seen in the past. So even if you’ve filled out a prior survey, it’d be amazing if you could head to stateofindiesaas.com and complete it. I wanted to let know about our MicroConf Mastermind Program. If you listen to the show, you know that I talk a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my own success. But finding the right founders for your mastermind group can be very hard. Over the past few years, my team at MicroConf has successfully matched more than 1,000 founders into mastermind groups by looking at revenue, team size, strengths, goals, and several other data points, to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once you’re matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series. A three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing, and more. If you’re looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business, and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your company and your success, you can learn more at microconf.com/masterminds. So with that, let’s dive into listener questions. Asia Orangio, thanks so much for joining me on the show again.  Asia Orangio:Yeah, thanks so much for having me.  Rob Walling:Another lister question episode. Back by popular demand. When I go on tour, when I go to MicroConfs, people are like, “You need to have Derrick Reimer back on the show, Asia Orangio, Ruben Gamez. Just have them on all the time.” So, it’s great to have you back.  Asia Orangio:Thank you so much. Yeah, speaking of Ruben, I got to go back and listen to that one. That sounds like a good one.  Rob Walling:Yeah, Ruben. If you go to startupsfortherestofus.com and there’s a little hour glass search at the top, just type in Ruben Gamez, and pretty much all those episodes, I wind up just re-listening to. I go back and listen to a lot of episodes as game tape. Not a lot of episodes, but I’ll go back a year or two and remind myself, “Oh yeah, that was the thinking then,” or “That’s actually a neat idea that I didn’t repeat 10 times, so I probably should.” Because, until I repeat it 10 times, none of us remember it. And a lot of the Ruben episodes have really good nuggets in them. You ready for the lister questions?  Asia Orangio:I am. Yeah, let’s jump in.  Rob Walling:Let’s do it. Our first question today, is a video question from John Mark, asking, “Would you adjust your target customer for an opportunity?”  John Mark:Hey Ron, my name is John Mark, and I’m building an app called Balance. It’s a budgeting tool targeted at first-time budgeters. I’ve been building it slowly over the last few months. And last week, Mint announced that they were shutting dow their budgeting platform, which leaves somewhere between three and 4 million monthly active users looking for a new budgeting app. I’ve seen a lot of other budgeting apps aggressively go after these users. Being small and not having a product that’s fully polished, I’ve got MVP features in place, but it’s pretty simple. I’m wondering if I should be ramping up to try to capture part of those Mint users. I’ve started to do a little research and started to talk to a few people. But they’re different from my target customer base. They’re typically looking for a free budgeting app. Mint was one of the few free budgeting apps that hold in your transactions automatically. And they might be using more advanced features than Mint, that I don’t have ready yet in my platform. And so my question for you is, would you try to carve off some of those customers? Even capturing 1%, which I know is a lofty goal, would still be life changing for Balance, and really get revenue coming in the door. I’m on pre-revenue. I wasn’t planning on releasing the MVP until Q1 of next year. I have felt the pressure a little bit and ramped it up from people looking to potentially support a smaller company, which Mint shutting down. And so I can get MVP out there in December, but it wouldn’t be… I don’t know if it’s quite the right fit for what Mint users are looking for. So I’d be curious on how you would advise in this situation, how you might handle a large influx of users that are close, but maybe not quite what you were targeting or what you were setting out for. Thanks for all you’ve done and all the other podcasts and resources you’ve put out there, they’ve helped me a bunch. Thanks Rob.  Rob Walling:What are your thoughts on this, Asia?  Asia Orangio:Okay, yeah. So, looking at this, this is a… It’s a go-to-market question. It’s a question around, “Is it worth my time to go after this customer base?” And usually when it comes to go-to-market in general, go-to-market being the practice of, “How do I deliver my product to an audience through channels, with a particular model, that enables them to buy it?” And when I hear this question or when I hear this context of a scenario, I think that there’s a couple of things to back into. So the first is, it sounds like John Mark is not necessarily convinced that… Like he’s unsure, it sounds like, around if this Mint audience is going to be a good audience for his product. I think that there’s two ways that I would recommend approaching this. It’s tough to say if the answer is yes or no. My heart hard assumption is that anyone who’s using Mint for free, may or may not actually be willing to pay for something. But that doesn’t necessarily mean though that those Mint users are not possibly using something else. So for example, I’ve been a Mint user for a very long time, but I also pay for YNAB. And they both give me different sets of data that I use that’s interesting to me. [inaudible 00:07:15] about to say, I almost would rather John Mark go and actually interview Mint users and find out for himself. He could do this using userinterviews.com. One interview on the B2C side, maybe might cost him 45 bucks. Maybe he throws 25 to 50 bucks at a person, I guess like a gift incentive. So let’s say on average he’s paying $90 per interview, he could do four or five of those and get answers pretty quickly on like, “Oh, are Mint users actually good users for me or no?” I don’t think that we can assume. My guess is if they’re not paying for it, maybe not. But that’s how I would approach the first part of this question that he has.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I think that’s a really good idea, is whether… What was it? Userinterviews.com, that you mentioned?  Asia Orangio:Mm-hmm.  Rob Walling:I was imagining, given how many Mint users there are, I’m going to on Twitter, I’m going go on whatever audience I have, and say, “Do you use Mint? Please let’s do a conversation.” Now maybe you’re in a bubble now, because if you’re a developer, then there’s a bunch of other developers on Twitter and you may not get the right swath of people. But I agree. So I’m in your boat where I’m maybe even more skeptical that free Mint users are going pay anything for anything. The reason that Mint worked is because they sold to Intuit. Mint was not a profitable company as far as I know. I’m pretty sure they raised a bunch of venture and then they were earning money and then they sold to Mint, somewhere like 10, 13 years ago. Is that right? around 2010, 20 whatever. Had they not done that… Like, they didn’t prove out that they had a successful business model. And the reason they worked was that Intuit then engineered it and made it lead gen, blah, blah, blah. But I mean, is it that successful of Intuit shutting it down? So I’m guessing that there is a lot of, whether it’s cost… Or there’s just, is this a bootstrapable business, taking on a bunch of Mint users? I’m pretty skeptical about that. Whether I talk to them or not, just on the face of it, I’m like… I’m not a believer. The other thing is if your product isn’t already there… I guess I didn’t look to see what the timeframe of Mint shutting down is. But my guess is if they’ve said they’re gonna shut down and people know this, usually you want to already be there, today or last month. It’s like, “Oh, my product is a perfect replacement for it.” But if you’re talking about spending a month or two to develop, and then trying to get the word out, my concern is things move fast, and are you too late? And is there already a good alternative to where you didn’t happen to hit the puck right at the right moment, and so the angle is going to be off, and it’s just not going to work?  Asia Orangio:So, it sounds like you’re taking it from the perspective from news hits, to, is it even worth my time? Am I even going to match up with this curve? And it’s very likely, maybe no.  Rob Walling:My impression. You and I are operating on limited information, right?  Asia Orangio:Totally.  Rob Walling:We’ve thought about it, you know, a collective four and a half minutes, right? Or a maybe a few minutes before the podcast. So it is hard without all the information, to make this decision. But on the surface the way he’s describing it as a product builder trying to kind of shoot a gap in a space where he’s like, “My product, I don’t know that I really want Mint users.” I mean, he says that in his question. “They aren’t really my ideal users, but oh, they down, there’s an opportunity.” That’s tough. It’s like, is the opportunity amazing and golden, or is it something that seems cool? And I think what you’re getting at, I think what both of us are getting at, is probably you need more information. And you’re saying, talk to customers. I’m saying, how about this? What if I run Instagram or Facebook ads to Mint users or people who follow me to wherever it is, to target, and say, “Mint user? Concerned their shutting down? Check out…” blah. Send them to a landing page, send them to a page to book you for a call. Send them to something. See if you can reach anybody through this just to get… Because you don’t need 10,000 people. If you get 50 people or 100 people, you know that you can get into… whether it’s conversations one on one via Zoom, or whether it is email conversations or whatever, I feel like you need more information to make this decision. I’m just giving a gut feel, leaning, based on a 90-second voicemail.  Asia Orangio:Totally. I also think too, it sounds like the MVP isn’t out yet. And that makes me think that Mint getting shut down, creates maybe an artificial pressure. But actually, as John Mark mentioned in his message, it’s very possible that these Mint users are actually not the ideal paying customer anyway. Especially if it’s largely free folks, which he actually mentions, yeah, in his message here. Yeah, I agree. There needs to be some type of validation. You can go the route of customer discovery. So of course, you could interview Mint users directly and get a feel for that. Then there’s also, Mint aside, who would be your best paying customer anyway, which is really the area in this space I’d probably spend more time in. And then there’s the other way that Rob was mentioning, which is, you could run a campaign and test this pretty quickly.  Rob Walling:So thanks for your question, John Mark. I hope our thoughts were helpful. Our next question is a voicemail from Daniel.  Daniel:Hey Rob, this is Daniel, tuning in from Germany. Thanks for your podcast. It’s a great source of knowledge and very inspiring to me. In one of the more recent episodes, you talked about certain anti-patterns that are usually a bad idea. One of them was to translate your app, which I agree with. I do wonder if this also applies to marketing, say, educational content on my website. So, for context, I’m working on a code review app called Codelantis. This is currently just a side project for me, and my primary goal is to get in touch with people interested in this particular field. Since I’m German, I could quite easily translate selected articles myself, and this would maybe help in terms of SEO and things like that. I’d be really curious to hear thoughts on that. Thanks for everything you do. Cheers.  Rob Walling:So just to clarify, my understanding is, and I went to his website, it’s codelantis.com. The H1 is “Understand and review pull requests fast with Codelantis.” The website is currently in English. And so I think what Daniel is asking, is, does it make sense, since he’s German, he speaks German, for him to start translating some marketing or educational content, some blog content, into German to potentially attract people? Because it sounds like it’s a relatively small lift. I mean, I don’t know, translating a blog post feels like a big lift for me. But anyways, I just want to clarify that, because I was trying to figure out… In the SaaS playbook, I talk about people who they hit their ceiling of 8K a month, and then they’re like, “I’m gonna translate this into Spanish, German, French and other things.” And I’m always like, unless your market is tiny, tiny, that’s not the next step. Do the hard thing, which is market and sell. Don’t use this excuse to go… It’s a form of procrastination, right? But Daniel’s asking, “Well, I’m German, maybe it doesn’t make sense to translate some blog posts and other marketing stuff into German. What’s your take on this, Asia?  Asia Orangio:Yeah. Okay, so I can see both sides to this. I think my ultimate strategic question would be, is this actually your next best growth opportunity? And we don’t have all the information, we don’t know what the MRR is, we don’t know all the things. But my first… This, I don’t think is a bad idea, at least short term. It could become challenging though, because while the founder may speak German, do you want to build out a marketing team and a support team that also speaks German, and also caters to the English markets? Globalization, on the one hand, especially now with AI, is actually very easy, and at the same time, not easy at all. Because you ultimately do need other people to support this additional language. It’ll just be you in the beginning, but then, assuming you grow and you build up a team, etc. they are also going to need to be able to support this other additional language. But, that aside, I think, again, I really go back to, is translation actually your next best thing to do? So I would be not knowing all the details, obviously, about the product, but I would actually be looking instead at, are there other channels? Are there messaging opportunities that I have that I’m not aware of? Are there onboarding activation? There’s monetization, retention. There’s a whole other world of growth opportunity that’s not translation. However, like globalizing in some kind of way, it could be an easy thing. But yeah, but then I also think, too, how much of the market is realistically looking for this? So it’s tough to say, but my guess is I’m soft on it. I feel like there’s probably other opportunity that’s maybe more pertinent, and also too, it’s another go-to-market question, right? Is supporting the German language… is that something that you’re actually gonna be committed to in the long run? And I think that that’s like… You know? Three years from now, five years from now, are you gonna have the resources available to support that? I think most people don’t think about that in that way.  Rob Walling:I love that. Yeah, I feel the same way as you do. I think I’d probably feel a little more strongly in him not doing it. I am pretty unconvinced that this is the next best thing for him to do. And I think the number one thing I thought of, was exactly what you said. Yeah, so you’re gonna get some Germans who come and use a product and maybe pay, and you’re supporting them in German, because you’re bilingual, and then you have some English users, and so now you have to hire support people who are bilingual. And when a German speaker starts using your app, aren’t they gonna want the app translated, too? Aren’t they gonna want your knowledge base translated, too? They’re gonna want email support. You know? It’s not always, but to Asia’s point, in the short term, you can kind of hack around these things, and in the long term, I just don’t think it’s good decision. My gut is that if English speaking is for developers, it looks like, or development managers, and it’s like the English market is plenty big, I would spend the time on that, rather than making things complex at this point. So thanks for your question, Daniel. I hope that was helpful. Our next question is a written question. So voicemails and video questions go to the top of the stack, except I feel bad, and sometimes written questions are so old. This is from May 9th, so this is a seven or eight month old question just because the video ones keep taking precedent. So I try to stick maybe one text question in each Q\u0026A episode just to get through a few of them. So this question is from Vijay, and he says, “I would love to hear any insights on how to go from B2C/freemium to B2B. How to keep small and individual users happy, they’re coming to me via word of mouth, but still sell to big companies? I started something small for my own use and made it available for free, then I added a couple more features with a B2C paid plan. Most of my users are from big enterprises and Fortune 500 companies, and happily use free features. I’m not making much money out of it. My plan is to add more valuable features and make it worthwhile for enterprises. But, for now, I’m stuck with the B2C freemium model, and I’m trying to figure out a way to go B2B. And based on his email address, it looks like he’s at agilebin.com. The H1 is “Improve productivity of scrum teams, using Agilebin power tools.” Asia, what do you think? This is another kind of go-to-market, isn’t it?  Asia Orangio:Mm-hmm, yeah. And this is interesting because when we think about go-to-market, which I like to use Brian Balfour’s framework for this. So product market, model and channel. And what Vijay is experiencing is, he created a product for a market, there’s something about the model that’s not sustaining that, financially speaking. He’s not making much money from it, he said. He mentioned freemium. And so now he wants to move from that to selling more to businesses. And that usually means… A change in market usually means a change in other aspects of your rich market strategy. So now we probably do need to change the product in some kind of way, which he mentioned. So I’m glad that he’s aware of, “I gotta go and build more features and make that more valuable to businesses.” So he asked the question, “How?” And I thought that was really interesting, because there’s many facets to the how. There’s the, “How do I figure out what the right features are?” Then there’s “How do I go out and get maybe the first customers of this new version of it?” Or I’m gonna put it in finger quotes of a pivot, because that’s kind of what it feels a little bit like. It doesn’t sound like a hard pivot. At least, we don’t know all the details. But, the how is interesting, because I think the how, it sounds like Vijay should probably go and… I know I’m probably going to say “Research” a bunch in this session as per usual, but I’d be curious about his product discovery process. So how does he discover what the product should be for these other businesses? And in that process, he will naturally come across ways of how he can actually acquire them. But I think it’s got to start with, “Well, what are we ultimately building and selling?” And then also, “Who are we selling it to?” It sounds like these businesses, but those have to get pretty crystal clear before we’re able to even figure out what channels should be in the first place. This sounds like part of discovery. This reminds me of the book, oh gosh, Continuous Discovery Habits by… is that Teresa Torres?  Rob Walling:Yes.  Asia Orangio:By Teresa Torres, yeah okay. That’s the book I would probably put in front of Vijay, in terms of answering the question of how from a product perspective. But then from a market perspective, I think that that’s going to depend very specifically on what types of companies he’s looking at. My guess, he’s going to be looking at some form of sales, like outbound sales of some kind. Probably going to be looking at Demand Gen in terms of acquisition. But from there, yeah, it’s going to depend a little bit, I think, on how he thinks about this. There are opportunities based on what agilebin.com does. This also reminds me a little bit of Dropbox and how Dropbox grew. I mean, we hear about growth loops all the time, but I’m wondering if there’s like a, this might be slower and longer, but there are likely growth loops that Agilebin could probably consider. But my guess is he probably wants money in its pocket sooner than later.  Rob Walling:That’s the challenge of freemium, right?  Asia Orangio:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Because it moves revenue out, which if you have kajillions in venture, you can do it. And if you’re bootstrapping and trying to quit a day job, usually you don’t want to do it.  Asia Orangio:Right.  Rob Walling:So that’s a challenge. I like the way you thought about it. Brian Balfour, he famously ran marketing at HubSpot, I believe, and now he has this… What is it, in the Bay Area? The academy he has. It’s teaching people how to market.  Asia Orangio:Oh, is it Reforge?  Rob Walling:Reforge.  Asia Orangio:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yep.  Asia Orangio:I love Reforge.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And Brian Balfour’s awesome. He just launched a podcast in the last few months as well. But I like your talk about go-to-product market model and channel. Those are the four. Before you said that, I was like, “I think the things that Vijay needs to think about, are how much the product needs to change, how his marketing might need to change, and how his sales operation needs to change.” Which I think right now he has no sales operation. So it overlaps a bit with what what you said. And realistically, the first question I have is, “Do you want to go after Fortune 500 companies and big enterprises?” You’re talking procurement, you’re talking sales cycles of six, nine, 12 months. I say this from second experience with 171 investments, who the majority of them do some type of sales process. And if you’re up for it, then awesome. But really be sure you want to do that. This is no longer an indie hacker project, once you do that. Product-led growth, as some people throw around, is much like freemium, way harder to do well than everyone thinks. And the second thought that I had is, “Does your product… Could it serve the enterprise today? Would they buy it as it is?” It’s not, will individual users use it? But, will a team pay the money for it. And pay enough money. Because the moment someone says procurement or custom terms of service, or “I want single sign on,” or “I want…” You know? Whatever. Enterprise to be able to this and that. All right, cool. Minimum, 30 grand a year. That’s it. I’m not going to go through the pain or do any of that for less than about, usually I say 25 to 35 grand a year. Minimum, minimum, minimum. Because otherwise, it’s just not worth it. And there’s only so many customers who are going to pay that. So that’s the thing I think I’d be thinking about. I mean, when I look at it super tactically, I think you can have a dual funnel, right? I talk about dual funnel where it’s like you have this low end funnel. That can either be free or it can just be inexpensive. Think of Castos which is podcast hosting. And they have $29 a month plans and they have plans that are thousands a month, where they do all the editing and everything. And that’s cool. He has a dual funnel, people coming in on the low end and the high end. There’s enterprise sales on the high end, and there’s not on the low end. It’s self-serve. And Ruben Gamez has this with Signwell as well. There’s the main product, e-signature, and then the API is pretty expensive. It’s a, “Call us,” type pricing. So you can do that. And I think Agilebin could potentially be that. But I don’t know. If you don’t already have the interest from the enterprise, you got to think, I guess it’s just as you said, it’s a cold outreach at that point. Or a warm outreach in this case, where you look at what are all the domain names on the emails I have in this free plan. Oh, there’s 10 people at Netflix, there’s seven people at Target, there’s nine at CVS. Are you now reaching out to them saying, “Hey…” That’s PLG, right? That’s what Slack has done. Is that a potential first step of just seeing if anybody responds or anybody cares or anybody’s using it enough to consider that there needs to be some type of enterprise plan? That’s probably how I would be thinking about it. The alternative is just to abandon the low-end at all, not do it to a funnel. Just say, “I’m going shut down the free plan,” or at least shut it down to new signups for now. And I’m going to double down and go all-in on enterprise, figure what to build to do it. I think that’s more risky, and I don’t know in the near term that I would necessarily do that. It feels like the free plan is his marketing right now. That’s the marketing channel, so he owns the leads, as Patrick says.  Asia Orangio:Right. And it’s… What’s the saying? “Freemium is not a revenue model,”?  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s just a marketing channel. Yeah.  Asia Orangio:Yeah. It’s more marketing. Something else that you mentioned that made me wonder, because it sounds like the tension is really not making enough. There was something… Yeah, “I’m not making much money out of it, So my plan is to…” et cetera, et cetera. That sounds like the tension point. And what I’m also curious about, is what if you switched away from freemium? That terrifies a lot of people. It scared a lot of people. But if there’s not that much coming in, if it does not feel like it’s as big of a risk, what if you move away from freemium and figured out how to make this work on the smaller end? There’s all kinds of trade-offs for this. But it makes me wonder, do we actually have a better product than what we think we do, and we’re just giving away a lot for free, basically?  Rob Walling:And moving away from freemium can be undone pretty easily, because you can just hide the free plan on the pricing page, wait a month or two, keep the free plan active, don’t kick everybody off, don’t start charging people yet, and just see what happens. And maybe do reach out to your free people, your folks who are currently on your free plan and be like, “Hey, did you know the pro plan is so amazing and you should really upgrade,” and blah, blah, blah, and see if you can sell it to anybody. That’ll start giving you an indication of “Have I really built something people want and are willing to pay for?” That’s my product market fit text expander. Not just building something people want. Building something they’re also willing to pay for. And I think that’s the biggest question that I’d be asking myself these days. So thanks for the question, Vijay.

Visit Lemon.io/startups.Our next question is a voicemail from Fred.  Fred:Hi Rob. My name is Fred. I’m a long-time listener, first time caller. My co-founder and I have a bootstrapped SaaS called Worktable, which offers a PC-based platform that makes webcam play easy for trading card games. As you mention periodically, engineers often hate sales, and we’re not exceptions. Yet, I’m particularly struggling with how to approach cross-channel marketing, if that’s the right term here. We have a warm lead, which is a charitable organization that serves children with prolonged stays in hospitals. They want to help the children they serve reconnect with friends and family, and a very common request is to play physical card games. As long as we can afford the cloud costs, we aim to serve them for free. Unfortunately, the goodness of our heart doesn’t pay the bills. Our hope is that they will give us an occasional shout-out to help us recruit paying customers who can enable this to continue indefinitely. The shout-out from them, could bring thousands of times more traffic than we’ve been able to generate ourselves. However, I realize just hoping isn’t enough. How do I frame this in my own mind, and in conversation with them, so that we all feel I am asking them for a win-win? Thanks in advance for your advice, and thank you for the thought-provoking discussions in the podcast.  Rob Walling:So this one’s interesting. This is why like listener question episodes. Because people come up with just stuff that I would never think of. What’s your take on this?  Asia Orangio:Okay, so there’s so many layers to this one. And I think that’s why it’s such an interesting question, and just scenario in general. So this first makes me think about what growth loops exist in the business today. And what I mean by growth loop, is there is some trigger that happens that generates either an awareness or an acquisition or some quality touch point with the person that you ultimately want to acquire. So for example, the most popular one that everyone knows about is Dropbox. When you sign up for Dropbox, you… What is it? If you share Dropbox, or you invite someone else, you get more space?  Rob Walling:You both get more space, I believe.  Asia Orangio:You both get more space? Slack is another really popular one. You create your organization on Slack. First thing Slack asks you to do, is to invite your team members, and then so on and so forth. The other most common growth loop that most people aren’t aware of, but most people have, are actually marketing websites. So you create content, it attracts people, ideal people come to your website, et cetera. Hopefully they sign up. It’s a tougher growth loop, because it’s not super predictable. It’s not like a one-to-one transactional type thing, but it is technically a growth loop. And what this made me think about, was, what are the growth loops that exist for this business when it comes to the charity specifically? So, when the charity is using, I think it’s video games. Is that what this is?  Rob Walling:It’s called WarpTable, and I had to Google it, but it’s software that allows you to play physical card games remotely. So think of Magic the Gathering or even I imagine Solitaire, or I don’t know, I have a bunch of games. So as long as you have a webcam set up and can see the cards on the table, and your opponent is on the other side of that, and they also have that, then… I don’t know exactly what the software does, but that’s basically what it is.  Asia Orangio:Yeah. So this makes me wonder. Well, first the request, it’s almost like a hopeful, “I want to maximize this as much as possible. I want to make sure this generates more customers for us.” And my first thought was, “What growth loops exist in the platform today, so that way when either the charity uses it or anyone from the charity, involved with the charity, et cetera, uses it, that it creates a natural growth loop? That was my first thought. And then the second thing that came to me was, it also kind of sounded like maybe Fred might have been stuck on positioning this to the charity. Like, “How do I position this in a way where they’re going to see the value and want to actually invest more in this or pay for it,” whatever it is. Because, unironically and maybe also ironically, Fred is like, “We are not running a charity, but we are helping charities.” Which I totally get that. I totally get that. So this kind of… It’s like a little bit positioning, and I also kind of felt like maybe also too, Fred is like, “I’m afraid to charge for it.” Especially if the kids love it.” So I don’t know. I could see scenarios where the relationship with the charity could be worked out where the charity does lots of case studies and does testimonials and things, and kind of makes it so that they become like marketing in a way. But I think that there’s also potentially product/platform opportunities or app opportunities, whatever that looks like, to ultimately generate, act as a growth loop. And then I think there’s this other part that’s like the conversation with the charity about, “How do I position this in way where they’re going to hopefully get it, see value, et cetera?” There’s many layers to it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I agree. The way I think about it is, the charity sounds awesome. They’re helping sick kids. And I think if you’re going to do it, yes, ask for… I love the idea of case study testimonials as marketing material. And if you ask for one or two emails to their list a year, that they promote you or something on social, what’s their biggest social channel. But I would be super specific about it. I wouldn’t occasionally mention. Like, what kind of feels right to you and not too much? Is it two mentions a year across channels? Is it three mentions? And then, assuming the costs aren’t big to serve these customers, I’m just… It’s PC software, so I’m assuming again, it’s not like a kajillion dollars. I would probably just go into it hoping that it broke even. And at best be like, “You know what? If this never does anything, at least I did good for the world, and at least I did good for this charity.” I don’t see a strong reason not to do this. Now, if they weren’t a charity… When I first read the question actually, because I read the transcript first, I didn’t catch that they were a charity. And I was like, “No, don’t do that. Don’t give away your software so they could talk about you.” But then I was like, “Oh, it serves children with prolonged stays in hospitals. Oh, I would just do that out of the goodness of my heart.” You know? And try to help them, again as long as the costs aren’t high. Anything, any marketing or any value you get out of it, to me, I think is a bonus. But I wouldn’t have high hopes for something like this. Of like, “Oh, I’m going to sell a bunch of pieces of software. “Because I think you might be let down.  Asia Orangio:Very, very valid point. That makes me wonder, there’s a charity, but are there other customers or users who are maybe much better fits for these asks? So it is a little bit more of a quid pro quo. But yeah, that’s a tough one. That’s a tough one.  Rob Walling:It is. And you do have ask yourself, if you’re trying to get a startup off the ground, as you said earlier, is this the biggest growth potential opportunity you have on your radar right now? It probably isn’t. But then we have to ask ourselves, who are we as people, and what are you willing to potentially sacrifice in terms of a time investment or in terms of some revenue, or whatever it is that you’re going to sacrifice, with the hopes of helping a charity and helping kids in hospitals, right? And so I think each of us has our own answer to that. Most of the time on the podcast we talk a lot about maximizing our growth, maximizing our enterprise value, while maintaining healthy relationships, right? While not driving our family and other relationships in the ground. But in this case, I think there is even that third factor of kind of broader world, and whether you’re willing to sacrifice a little bit in order to help them out. So thanks for that question, Fred. Hope that was helpful. For our final question of the day, we have a video question from Patrick on how to advertise an unknown product category.  Patrick:Hey, Rob. Thanks for all the great episodes. Huge fan. Steve Jobs is famous for saying that… What is it? “People don’t know what they want, until you show it to them.” This can be a really good thing, because it means you’ve got a blue ocean new product like the iPhone. The problem I’m running into, is how do you run advertising campaigns for some things people don’t know exits? My product is in the B2B SaaS space. It’s called ThreadLive. It’s an email workspace designed for B2B sales and procurement people, and project teams that are spending hours every day managing emails. We got a Chrome extension that goes right into Gmail, so you can quickly mirror emails into our platform, and then manage them like you would a file, or share them with other people. Anyway, our initial focus is single player mode, MVP. And we plan to introduce collaboration features in the future. We’ve got a freemium model, and then after about two months of use, we’ll be charging $20 a month. So, clearly this is a product that needs many users to be successful, so we need a low-touch model. The problem is there just aren’t a lot of people searching for something they don’t know that they need. So, what do think is the best way to contact and market to these types of users? Thank you.  Rob Walling:So, before I kick it to you, Asia, I want to do my famous startups for the rest of us, comments, about, please don’t use Steve Jobs or Basecamp as examples. Because, Steve… when he was 23, guess how much he was worth. $1 million. Which is actually about 5x. He would be worth $5 million. When he was 24, he was worth $10 million. When he was 25, he was $100 million. You know what I mean? And so, if you’re in that case, then use Steve Jobs as an example. If you co-invented, or, say, co-founded a company with the inventor of a once-in-a-generation device, the Apple computer at the time, then use him as an example. If you bootstrapped to nine figures in ARR, and you were one of the first SaaS apps ever, and you did a really good job executing, but also got a little lucky, as Jason Fried said on the MicroConf stage, then use them as an example. Otherwise, you’re not in their shoes. You don’t have the resources. You can’t. Basecamp comes and says, “We don’t do marketing, we don’t track analytics, we don’t track opens.” And so should you? Well, are you Basecamp? Keep in mind who you’re following. So I just want say that, as anytime I hear the Steve Jobs, the Basecamp, or Henry Ford’s often quoted, and I’m like, “Oh, so you’re in their boat, then.” Because no, you’re not. Most of us aren’t, and we have to grind and we have to do things a little differently. And I want to be honest, Jason Fried and DHH are TinySeed mentors. They invested in our first fund. So I’m not throwing shade at them, but I’m saying they often give advice that fits them really well and worked for them, that I think it won’t work for 999 out of the next thousand startups. So anyways, with that, Asia, you want to take a crack at this one?  Asia Orangio:Yeah. Oh, I’ll throw in timing as well. I think, thinking about timing, and curves and all of that, and when certain things… But anyway, okay. So this question is really all about, I’m hearing there’s messaging challenges. I’m also hearing a little bit positioning, and if you follow the April Dunford model, of course, then you know that messaging is derived from your positioning. So it really starts with pretty solid positioning, and then of course we get into messaging. The thing about customers not knowing what they want, until they have it, the thing about that statement is that customers are never going to be good product managers. They’re never going to be able to tell you what features to build or what to do. They can really only tell you what they want. And it’s our job as product managers and product owners to extract that at scale at a very high level, and also get into the nitty details of, okay, how does this actually translate into value, based off of what the customer is asking for? And how can this be translated more globally across the whole product? But, even when we do that, what we find is there is some narrative or story that we were telling about how this product ultimately contributes value to people. And even if you don’t have a software category that this fits into, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re not going to have words for how to describe this to folks. Because ultimately, customers connect the most with what their pains are, what they’re struggling with, and what they’re hoping to achieve and to accomplish. Ideally using your product. But, if we were to get break this down two jobs to be done, which is a framework for interviewing customers and really understanding what progress they’re trying to make, what we’re going to find is that customers, ultimately, once they have their jobs, they come to you, you satisfy the jobs. And then over time, the jobs change. And new jobs pop up, and hopefully your product still surfaces or satisfies those needs, and otherwise they turn. But, all that’s to say, though, that most customers are not necessarily looking for, “I want the absolute best CRM,” and then they go to the CRM category and they troll through… Usually it’s, “Yeah sure, I want the CRM but there’s all these other things I want about this.” And so my question to Patrick would be, it’s okay if there’s not really a category for this. That actually is the least one my worries. I’m far more concerned with how does your customer describe it, and therefore how do we now use that to inform our messaging? And that’s what we use in our advertising, that’s what we use on our website. That’s what we use to really connect with a customer who’s trying to buy this. The first part of the question, that’s where I start with. So the second part is really all about… So, people aren’t searching for this, because there’s no software category for this, that people are not searching for it. But going back to what I was saying earlier, my thinking around this though, is there might not be a category for this that they’re searching for, but they probably are searching for, “I have this problem, I have this pain.” And what are y’all using to satisfy this problem or this pain?” And again, this is probably gonna be long tail keyword type work, but that’s the first thing that comes to mind. I think the second thing that comes to mind, is we are making the assumption that search is going to be the first way that people discover this as a product. So I think my other question of course would be, if we were to sell this to folks, what are some other ways that people might discover this product in the context that of course they’re using it in? So, this is a… What was it? It’s a Chrome extension?  Rob Walling:Yep, for email productivity.  Asia Orangio:Mm-hmm. This automatically makes me think about what, about, oh gosh, like the Google App Store, or the Chrome App Store. Is there discovery happening through that? I’m also curious too about, what are some of the…. are we translating this into other browsers? There’s many other ways to distribute, is what I’m getting at, beyond just search.  Rob Walling:I like those. Yes, anding you, because I agree with those, and I want to kind of pile a little bit on. You actually mentioned early on about product, and how as product owners, we don’t build what customers tell us to build. We hear what their problems are, and then we have to translate that into a solution, right? So I did a rant on this podcast probably within the last year on a solo episode where I talked about the Henry Ford, “If I’d given them what they wanted, they would have given a faster horse.” No, you wouldn’t have. Not if you’re a good product person. Because they would’ve said, “A faster horse.” And I would have thought, “Well, I can’t make a faster horse. But, could I make a train run the same routes as a…” You know what mean? And you eventually get to where it’s like, “Could I make a device that…” Because they don’t want a horse, they just want a faster X. So what is that? Is that a steam powered car? You know what mean? Like, you get there. And if you’re a good product person, again, yeah, you figure it out, right? The second thing I’m thinking about… I guess I want to piggyback on what you said, of it doesn’t just have to be search. But, what you do need is a massive traffic channel. Massive, to make this work. The only companies that I know, who have made this type of low price point freemium model work, get hundreds of thousands, if not millions of uniques per month. Whatever that channel is, usually it’s search, to be honest. Usually it’s content and search, or they have a media company and they an audience. But there’s a possibility that the Chrome extension and App Store has enough traffic to do it. I don’t know of a single example. I was trying to think as you were talking, about a single example of anyone who’s bootstrapped a business like this. Because the ones that I know where it truly was freemium and then 20 bucks a month, are the Dropboxes. How much did they raise? A kajillion dollars. Mint.com, throwback to 20 minutes ago, a kajillion dollars. Trello, Hootsuite, Spotify. You know what mean? On and on and on. Yeah, they’re all freemium. They made it work and they have less than $20… And even think of Netflix with the free trial, and then they’re now 20 bucks, and HBO, and this and that. I know that’s content, not software. But, all of them, just bank accounts, vaults filled with money, with rooms of money. So if you’re trying to bootstrap a business, unless you were showed amazing traction and growth, TinySeed would not invest in this business. Because, I don’t believe that you can bootstrap it. I say that a little more confident than I am. I don’t want say 100 % never going to work. 95 % sure, this is an inviable business without quite a bit of funding. And it’s because you need to last. You need to last for years. Because Dropbox, remember their early numbers were like “3% of our users used it for free for a year, and then convert to paid.” And that was a pretty high number, actually. So do the math on that, 3%. So let’s say you have 50,000 free users, which is actually a lot. That’s a lot of free users who are… 50,000 active free users. So after one year, that means you’ll have 1,500 paying customers. And at 1,500, doing internet math, live on the internet, times $20 a month, is $30,000 of MRR. That is not a viable business, because you’re never going to get to 50,000 active… because 50,000 active freemium user, even if you’re sticky, what is that? 250,000 total premium signups? I don’t know what… you know, I’m kind of making up numbers here, but you got a big drop off here, so you got to think about this funnel. And other than just having a kajillion search visitors hitting you every month and replenishing that, I don’t know how else you do it, unless it’s to your point, one of these other channels that you were talking about. Those channels just have to be really wide. You don’t do this with 10,000 uniques a month. You do it with half a million uniques a month. If you do it at all, you do it with half a million or a million. So, this is where I struggle. I mean, on this podcast, I kind of have said, I don’t answer questions about two-sided marketplaces, about bootstrapping them, unless you already have one side of them. Because everybody seems to want to do it, and it’s just like, it doesn’t work. Stop, please. The other thing is B2C. And I know this is not B2C. You know, it’s B2B because it’s email productivity. But, the funnel is like a B2C product. And unless you’ve made this work, or unless you know what you’re doing, meaning you are Ruben Gamez or Hiten Shah, or Brian Balfour, or you’re getting mentorship from someone like that and you’re really trying all the things, just setting up the funnel in the way that Dropbox, Mint, Trello, Hootsuite, did, just setting up that funnel, doesn’t make it work. Because it’s cargo culting, right? It’s picking one thing and being like, “Oh, this works because of that.” And it’s like, no, it works because all of it was there. If any one of those pieces hadn’t worked, the business was completely inviable. And the thing we don’t see, is it’s a survivor bias a bit. It’s like, what about the… Again, I mentioned Dropbox, Mint, Trello, Hootsuite, Spotify. What about the 99 others or the 10,000 others that just didn’t make it, because they tried this model, and later they pivot? So, I don’t want to be the naysayer. I’m positive, Asia. I want to build people up, but this is a business, from what I’m hearing, I’m just skeptical it’s going to work. But I’m not saying it’s not going to work in any form. It’s like, what would it look like to not do freemium? Or what would it look like to charge $200 a month, or $250 a month, and only sell to enterprise. You know? What else can we tweak to make this a much more viable business? That’s probably where I would start if we were to say, do a strategy session on this.  Asia Orangio:This actually does make me think though of businesses that, they’re in the process of monetizing their Google Chrome extensions. So Adblock Plus, I don’t know if anyone’s using Adblock Plus, but they have within the last, I would say, six months or a year, have aggressively moved to, “Hey, please pay us.” And it is shocking, but also not. Because obviously I’m in the SaaS world, so I’m using software all the time, all day, every day. But, it is shocking how much I don’t want to pay for it, because I’m so used to having it for free. And I’m just like, “Ugh, I don’t want to have pay another thing.” You know? But, I almost guarantee, if this had been more, if I had the free trial, and I saw how amazing it was, and then… If I had been trained in that way, I probably would be more like, “Oh yeah, I’ll pay for this.” Usually, freemium, it’s crazy in the numbers game, but you’re exactly right. In order for that to be viable, it’s gotta be a two to 3% conversion rate into paid. And there are businesses who of course achieve this, and actually beyond. I’ve seen it. But I would say most folks are much below that.  Rob Walling:Most are, yeah. Most are below 1%.  Asia Orangio:Yeah.  Rob Walling:That, I see. I see quite a few freemium. There is a significant enough number of TinySeed companies or companies that I’ve advised, that have freedom plans or have had freedom plans. And I see the numbers on them, to know that yeah, 3% usually you would celebrate that. One other thought, I wanted to bring up the five stages of awareness. And I did a MicroConf talk in Europe about this a couple of months ago. I think that talk will be available for sale here soon. But, if you have never seen this diagram, you can type in five stages of awareness, Eugene Schwartz. And really, Patrick’s question was not about his business model, and asking me to tell him he shouldn’t do it. His question was like, if no one’s searching for it, which you addressed, maybe people are, maybe in different ways, but, if no one’s searching for it, how do you get awareness? And realistically, you have to do what you said, which is go after the problem. Because they’re not searching for a solution, but they probably do have this problem. And five stages of awareness are unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware. In a perfect world, you cater to the last two of those, or maybe the last three. That they are looking for a solution, they know the name of your product, and they really know the space well. As you go further up that chain, so unaware and problem aware, becomes way more expensive, way more time intensive to capture them. And that’s what I was saying with this, is, based on your freemium model and your price point, you need a huge funnel, very wide. And usually, that search can be other things. Of course, if you’re truly just trying to advertise, then you go on Instagram. I mean, how much stuff have I bought, where I barely had a problem, or I really was unaware that I have a problem? Like the Amazon flash sale. Oh, I didn’t realize that I needed another pair of slippers, but they totally advertised to me on Instagram. Or, I bought this thing called a flexiCam, which I kind of realized I had a problem, but I didn’t realize there was a solution. And it’s a see-through thing where you hang your webcam down in your screen, so you can hang it over a Google Doc. PlexiCam I believe it’s called. I just saw an add on Instagram, I was like, “Oh, yeah, I do have that problem.” I had no idea there was a solution. And so they ran an ad. Here’s the thing, ads are expensive. And that’s why I said, if you’re going to try to do this with ads or whatever, you don’t bootstrap this business. That’s my sentiment, is you do have to raise buckets of funding to be able to optimize that ad funnel. And then why does PlexiCam and Amazon, why do they work? Why can they run those ads? Well, it’s because they sell a product with a decent chunk… You know? That PlexiCam is $50, $70, whatever it is. So they paid off that ad spend real quick. Patrick’s in this case, said “Well, they’re freemium for two months. Only if they’re a heavy user, then they convert to 20 bucks…” You know? What are we talking? Six months out, before we get payback? That starts to be challenging. And it’s going to be further than six months, because you’re going to lose a bunch. So you’re talking a 12-month payback, a nine-month payback. And as a bootstrap, you don’t have the money to keep doing that.  Asia Orangio:I think too, it seems like there’s an assumption that people don’t actually know about email collaboration tools. But there are absolutely shared inboxes. Front is a huge one. There are shared inboxes that are geared to specific audiences, like support, for example. But email collaboration and shared inboxes, they’re not a totally new concept. It just might be new for maybe the people he’s targeting. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that people are not solution aware. His audience, they are probably solution aware. They just don’t know that his product is in existence. And that’s a very different scenario. That’s actually a much more favorable ecosystem to be in. Because, what you don’t want is people who are truly unaware. Like, they don’t even know that they have a problem and this is painful for them. And those are people you don’t want to waste your time on. But it’s very possible that they actually are problem aware. They don’t know that ThreadLive actually exists. And that’s the difference between solution aware versus maybe product aware. That’s the difference. But I would argue that they probably are aware of other solutions. They’re just maybe [inaudible 00:50:58], and they don’t actually solve the problem, so they don’t don’t buy them, they don’t do them. But this warrants much more discussion, I think. I don’t think we can assume that they are truly unaware of solutions like this. It’s just much more likely that they’re unaware of ThreadLive, specifically.  Rob Walling:I like that. Yeah, I like that clarification. So thanks for that question, Patrick. I hope it was helpful. Asia Orangio, thanks for another banger episode.  Asia Orangio:Did we do it?  Rob Walling:We made it through. For folks who don’t know, you are the founder of DemandMaven at demandmaven.io. And of course you are Asia Orangio on the Twitters. Thanks so much for joining me today.  Asia Orangio:Thanks so much for having me.  Rob Walling:Thanks again Asia, for coming back on Startups for the Rest of Us. I hope your new year is going well. I hope it’s off to a great start. I’ll be talking back at you again next Tuesday.

And today I look back at my 2023, and I reflect on the highs and the lows of the year. I’m going to talk through my experiences working on and growing TinySeed, and MicroConf and this podcast because those are the three things that I focused on throughout the year, as well as give some reflections on how I can improve and make things better for myself and those around me in the year ahead. If this is your first episode of Startups For the Rest of Us, or you’d prefer not to hear Inside Baseball about what’s going on with me and my professional life, maybe even a little bit personal, we’ll see where it goes, you probably want to either go backwards or go forwards. Skip back forward weeks, go ahead one week, this really is going to be me talking about my experience of this year. And I’m not sharing it just to make myself feel good or to hear myself talk. I’m sharing it so you can perhaps see what it’s like for someone who, I think by all measures, is pretty successful, but the things that I still struggle with. I think, at a certain point, I thought, if only I had an app that did $3,000 a month, everything would be perfect. If only I had a $10,000 a month SaaS company, then I could quit my job and everything would be great. If only I built a company to multiple seven figures in ARR and then sold it for life-changing exit, if only, on and on and on. And it’s just something to realize that there is the arrival fallacy that you’ve never arrived. And when you reach that next mountain, there’s always another one on the horizon. And so I’m sharing this, hopefully, to help motivate you, inspire you, and show you the reflection process that I go through at the end of the year to figure out how to make the next year better. So hopefully there are some nuggets in this episode that you can learn from, but my feelings won’t be hurt if you decide to skip to the next one. Before we dive into that, we are running the next edition of the State of Independent Saas survey and report. Through Microconf, we’ve run the survey a couple of times, and then we decided to take last year off because the information coming through wasn’t changing. The survey is about 40 questions. It takes less than 10 minutes to complete if you have your metrics handy. And then we take that data from what usually winds up being between 600 and 1,000 independent SaaS companies. These are bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies, and we compile a report with all the key findings and helpful industry benchmarks that you don’t get anywhere else. The survey closes soon. We could really use your input. All the data is kept anonymous, and every survey response we get makes the report that much better. Head to stateofindysaas.com to complete the survey, and we’re going to enter everyone who completes the survey into a drawing for a free ticket to Microconf US 2024 in Atlanta. That’s more than a $1,000 value. I know it’s a lot for me to ask you for 10 minutes out of your busy day, but it really would go a long way towards making this year’s report the best yet. We are mixing it up this year asking different questions and pulling out different findings than you’ve seen in the past. So even if you’ve filled out a prior survey, it’d be amazing if you could head to stateofindiesaas.com and complete it. If I were to describe how 2023 has felt, how things have gone, it really is almost polar opposites. It’s incredible growth. I think this year had one of the largest audience growth years that I’ve ever had. It might be the number one year in terms of how much my audience grew, between publishing the SaaS Playbook and doing the Kickstarter for that in May. Sold about, I think, just under 3000 copies there. And just last month, past 10,000 total copies sold of that book. And to put that into perspective, it’s self-published book, Start Small, Stay Small, which I published in 2010, has sold a total of just under 15,000 copies in 13 years. And that’s been amazing. I mean, that book has made me… I’d have to run the numbers. Between selling on Amazon and Audible and then selling directly, it’s got to be 350, $400,000 on Start Small, Stay Small. And the SaaS Playbook already passing 10,000 copies sold, I will admit is beyond even the ambitious goal that I had. I was happy with the Kickstarter raising low six figures, $108,000, and selling, again, almost 3,000 copies. What I wasn’t prepared for was the continued strong sales. And I think I’m a bit naive. I’m a bit naive on that because I always underestimate, I think, the power of creating good content and the willingness and desire for people to share that. So I’m definitely stoked to have that many copies sold. And then, in terms of the audience growth, this year, if you combine MicroConf, TinySeed and this podcast, our email lists and the listeners of this show and the YouTube channel subscribers, it is absolutely past 100,000 people being reached on whatever, a weekly and monthly basis. Depending on how you count it, even if you dupe and assume there’s overlap, we’re probably past 150,000. It’s a lot of people. Everything’s working as it should be. As my mission that I think has become the mission of TinySeed and Microconf is to multiply the world’s population of independent self-sustaining startups. And in order to do that, we have to reach a lot of people. The more people you reach, the more people that you can help and educate, potentially advise, invest in, match together, connect with one another, and have an impact on. And so, for me, audience building and increasing our reach is not a vanity metric. It is a top line key performance indicator of how well we’re doing. And so you contrast 10,000 copies sold of the SaaS Playbook in the last seven months. You contrast our reach crossing 100,000 or 150,000, it depends on how you count it, say 150,000 person reach, and you contrast that with something I talked about in a podcast episode probably five or six months ago, I think it was during the summer where I said, “I’m not burned out, but I can see it on the horizon.” And I talked in that episode about a big piece of this… I don’t want to say burnout because burnout is a very technical term, and I have not been burned out this year, and I’m not burned out now, but it’s shorthand for being tired. Maybe I’ll say I’m tired or fatigued or world-weary, whatever adjective we want to use. And for me, a big piece of that in the summer was the grind of our content schedule. I record 52 YouTube videos a year. I record 52 episodes of this podcast a year, and then 52 episodes of the MicroConf podcast a year. So you’re talking 156 pieces of content that we push out that doesn’t include MicroConf remotes in-person MicroConfs, five TinySeed events. It’s a lot going on. And while one could argue… The MicroConf podcast, I only record intros. It’s not a full podcast I have to do custom information for, but it’s all work and is something that it doesn’t go away. I don’t take a vacation, or when I take a vacation, I have to record ahead. And so the way I started getting around that fatigue or tiredness of the grind was, A, we started finding some folks who could help fill in on the YouTube channel. So I didn’t have to record four videos a month, maybe it’s three. And I started batching recordings. So I would record four YouTube videos in a week, and then I was able to take three weeks off. And that worked until the fall. So this fall, I traveled more in a maybe 10, 11 week period than at any other single time in my life. And for those of you who travel a lot for work, especially if you have a family at home that you like hanging out with, I like my family. I like my house, I like Minneapolis. I like my dog. So while I don’t mind being away from home taking whatever it was, six, seven trips, two of them to Europe in a pretty tight timeframe with the time zone changes and all that, it starts to take its toll on you. And there’s a physical toll of the sleepless nights and taking melatonin to try to get on time and then flying back and waking up at four in the morning and trying to operate during the day. And there’s the mental toll and the emotional toll of not being around “my people,” my family at home, and the comfort and I think the stability of what we’ve built here in Minneapolis. And so this fall was tough, and it was a combination of things. It was a perfect storm of, we had multiple TinySeed events, we had multiple MicroConfs, and I agreed to speak at a couple of events. And now that I published the SaaS Playbook, I’m getting speaking invites again. And around all that travel, of course, I was continuing to try to ship YouTube videos or I would say continuing to ship YouTube videos and episodes of this podcast. As I commented on a previous episode, you’ll notice there were more solo episodes than usual, and it because I just didn’t have any time to plan to record with anyone. And when I was at home, I needed to hop on it real quick. And oftentimes I had to record an episode last minute right before a flight was taking off. So I didn’t have time to schedule it. And so the show must go on, as I say, and I feel like I was able to maintain the quality of the YouTube videos in this podcast, but it all takes a toll. And so that’s what I’ve been reflecting on as the fall has wrapped up, because I’m done with work travel until January. I have one trip there, and then I don’t believe I have any more travel until April, which is MicroConf in Atlanta. If you don’t have your tickets yet, microconf.com/us. And so any year where the podcast and the YouTube channel and our audience in general grew faster than any a year prior, where TinySeed was firing on all cylinders, we funded 40 something companies this year, bringing our total to more than 150 companies. And the MicroConf YouTube channel, I realized I got an email the other day that our YouTube channel passed 3.5 million total views, which is pretty incredible. And we ran… I’m trying to think of how many in-person events. I think it was six or seven successfully broke even, made a profit on those. We matched hundreds of folks into mastermind groups. Everything’s working, everything’s up into the right, and yet you can still feel fatigued. You can still be approaching burnout. And if you don’t catch it early and do something to mitigate that and make a change, then you’re going to hit it. Once you get into burnout, it’s really hard to undo. Usually, you have to take months off. Sherry and I have a chapter in our book, the Entrepreneur Guide to Keeping Your (beep) Together, about if you’re dealing with burnout. And it’s pretty drastic what you need to do. And so I don’t want to get there. So you have to make changes early because if you ignore it, it’s not going to go away. The ostrich approach to burnout, putting your head in the sand and thinking it’s going to get better by itself, it doesn’t work. And in fact, I’ve tried that in the past and it didn’t turn out well. And so my thinking at this point is, all right, all this has happened. How do I avoid this next year? Because I’m in a lull now, and I say that in the most positive way that I possibly can, relax, not traveling, don’t have a ton of work on my plate other than things like this podcast and the YouTube channel. And so as I look ahead towards next year, I think to myself, okay, how can I do this better? And so there are a few changes, and it’s a few changes I’ve talked with my team about already. One is to continue to lean on my team around me to help create YouTube videos such that every YouTube video doesn’t need to be me. And it looks like for the next couple months, I think I’m recording about half of the YouTube videos that I traditionally have, which is great. I’m also taking time off. I’m going to take between three and four weeks off over the holiday break here, Christmas and New Year’s, and then in the early parts of January because it is pretty quiet and the ability to just unlock, unplug and not feel like I have to be thinking about, I love SaaS and I love startups. I mean, this is my life. It is my life’s work. It is my life’s mission. It’s what I think about every day, but even something you love, you sometimes need a break from. And that is the case with me right now. And so after recording this episode, I have another couple calls and then I’m unplugging. I do have some calls tomorrow, actually. This is what always happens, is I plan to take time off and things sneak in that are important and that I need to do, but that’s what I’m thinking about and that’s the direction I’m heading towards is temporarily taking some time off to recharge the batteries. I’m going to not think about work or… Actually, what I will wind up doing is thinking about work, but at a very high level. I’ll be thinking about strategy and high level vision of what do I want 2024 to look like, where do I want MicroConf, TinySeed and this podcast to be at the end of 2024? What are changes that may need to happen that are beyond things that I talk about on this show, beyond just handing off a couple YouTube videos each month? Another one of those changes is the amount of travel. And I know that for me at this point in my life, I can totally travel a handful of times a year, but six, seven trips in 10 or 11 weeks, it doesn’t make sense. And it is 100%… Especially with the time changes, the eight-hour time changes were rough. And so that’s something I’m looking at for next year is, how do we adjust schedules to make things more productive for everybody? That’s the other thing is I say this as if I’m the only one that got burned out. There are other people on my team who have really struggled with just getting back into the mindset of being productive. Pretty much everybody got sick, and that’s a travel thing, I think, less than a being around people. But whatever it is, almost everybody on my team who traveled got sick. Knock on wood, I didn’t. But really took a toll on the team as a whole. And so it’s one of those things where you look at the calendar, you’re like, this isn’t that bad. Hopping a flight to Miami and then heading to Tennessee to do a talk and then heading back and then a week later doing something else. It didn’t look that bad and it doesn’t look that bad. But the way it felt, for me, now I know. In the future, I just have to say no to some things. I can’t do everything. We’re all still learning. And when I was younger or at a different time in my life, maybe if I wasn’t married, didn’t have kids, there’s all these things that could make it different and could make it feel different. But for me, as I evaluate what gave me life this year and what didn’t, the things that gave me life, were shipping this podcast, the reactions to the YouTube videos, publishing the SaaS Playbook, putting content into the world, putting things into the world that inspire and motivate and educate people so that they can change their lives. Because after all, that all serves my mission of multiplying the world’s population of self-sustaining independent startups. And that mission brings me so much excitement and joy and motivation. And so being able to ship that content… Content’s such a generic word, but it’s books and it’s podcasts, and it’s YouTube videos and even conference talks. Being able to inspire, motivate, and educate people has been super fulfilling. And so I have to figure out how do I keep doing that in a sustainable way such that I… I’ve been doing this, what? I’ve been blogging since 2005, so 18 years, almost 19 as of a few weeks from now,.and been writing books since 2010, been podcasting since 2010, 13 years, almost 14 years. I’m going to keep doing it. I hope you don’t think this episode is me saying, oh, I’m retiring from all this content because that’s not the thing. I’m actually figuring out how do I continue to do that at the pace and the quality that I have been, and maybe even improving the pace and improving the quality, but you get the idea. And then on the flip side, when I look at things that took life for me or that drained energy, definitely travel is one of them. And it was the pace of travel. It’s not ever getting on a plane because I’m going to Cancun with my family in a couple of weeks and that is going to energize me. Being on the plane will not sap energy at that point. And so it really is the pace of travel and the grind of it. And there are some additional things that wind up on my to-do list in my email box, in my Trello board that certainly don’t give me life that I’m also revisiting in the sense of, do we really need to do this? Can I hand it off to someone? Can I just not do this? So I have my shortlist there that isn’t as relevant to share with you on this podcast. So as usually happens at the end of the year, I’m cautiously optimistic about what the next year looks like because I feel like I’ve experienced some high highs and some low lows, some incredible challenges that I’ve overcome, but also some challenges that have really beaten me down, but I’m making a change. That’s the key, is if I were to continue doing the same thing and expecting different results, that would just be dumb. And so that’s my charge to you as you listen to this episode, is what do you need to change in your life to keep doing the things that you love to do less of the things you don’t? That really starts with just evaluation. What do you love doing? What’s brought you life this last year? What has sucked energy over the past year? And whether you get away and do a true founder retreat, which actually I have not this time, I just haven’t had the time for it, or whether you just spend an afternoon or a few days, evenings, weekend just thinking about these topics, make that list, do some journaling, make some bullet points in a notebook, and then figure out what changes that you need to make to live a better life, to enjoy your work more. If you don’t like your job, it’s no one else’s fault because you’re your own boss. You run the company. If you don’t love running your company, then change it. Figure out how to make it sustainable. Figure out how to make it enjoyable for you. If you are going to go on a full founder retreat, my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling, has written a book called The Zen Founder Guide to Founder Retreats, and it’s an ebook. I think it’s $20 on Gumroad. You can just Google it. And it’s super helpful. It’s a whole list of questions and practices for thinking through what gave you life and what didn’t, and it goes more in-depth on that. But whether you use that or you just do a very simple version like I’ve done this year, I wish you the best of luck as you embark upon this journey and you transition from ’23 to ’24. And I hope that when you’re done with this exercise, I guess whether you do it or not, I hope that you’re looking forward to 2024 with cautious optimism as well. Thanks so much for joining me this week and every week on the show. It’s great to have you here. And if you keep listening, I’ll keep making these.

Today I have a mostly bootstrapped startup founder on the show. He is the founder of Postpone at, postpone.app. We’re going to talk about how he’s grown Postpone from zero to mid six figures, and how he came up with the idea by scratching his own itch. We talk about some early growth tactics he used, a recent price increase that was stressful, but highly successful, the platform risk that he’s experienced with Reddit, and more topics for bootstrap founders like yourself. It’s a great interview. I hope you enjoy it. One more thing, we’ve recently reopened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other and discussing wins, challenges, and frankly, how to grow faster. A couple of months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your requests. With MicroConf Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks, like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out, microconf. Connect.com. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation. Grant McConnaughey, thanks for joining me.  Grant McConnaughey:Thanks so much for having me, Rob.  Rob Walling:Longtime listener of the show, and now you’re going to be on it. Are you going to love listening to this episode and hearing your own voice?  Grant McConnaughey:It is going to drive me crazy, but I will force myself to do it.  Rob Walling:It drives everyone crazy. I view interviews and talks. They’re painful for me to watch, but they’re game tape. How can I get better as an interviewee, an interviewer, or someone who’s doing a talk? Your app is Postpone. It’s at, postpone.app. Your H1 is the Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok scheduler for creators, automate sharing your content across all your social media accounts, and grow a following. So folks know you are a TinySeed company. You started developing Postpone in January of 2021. How did this come about? Folks who listen to this have either no ideas or a lot of ideas. Did you have a cajillion, and you picked one, or was it just so obvious to you this needed to get built?  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, sorry, and just to clarify, it was January, 2020.  Rob Walling:Thank you.  Grant McConnaughey:So started working on it a couple of months before COVID hit. It really started as a New Year’s resolution project. I wanted to grow a following on Twitter, write blog posts, and get some sort of following about software engineering and things like that. I have a lot of respect for folks like Adam Wathan who’ve built this incredible following on Twitter, and then found ways to build products that those folks are interested in. And it becomes this feedback loop where you’re just building cool stuff for people. They’re buying it, you’re growing an audience, and it’s just this self-sustaining thing. So to do that, I really wanted to write blog posts and share them on Reddit as well as Twitter and other places. If I found that there wasn’t really a Reddit scheduler that existed, or at least not one that I thought was very professionally looking, there’s a couple that existed. I remember thinking, “I feel like I could do this. Maybe there’s other folks who also want to post on Reddit and treat Reddit the way they do their Twitter account.” Threads wasn’t around at the time, but those kinds of social media apps. So I ended up just working on it, and had this idea of, “Why don’t I build the Reddit app? I will use the Reddit app to market my own blog posts. I will write about building the Reddit app, and it will become this self-sustaining thing where I build the product, I use the product, I write about the product.” S that’s really where it ended up starting, just something I thought I needed myself and hey, maybe other people will find value in this as well.  Rob Walling:So scratch your own itch, which cuts both ways. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes you’re the only one that needs it, or no one’s willing to, but you need it, but you really wouldn’t be willing to pay for it and other people wouldn’t, or you can’t reach the customer. There’s a bunch of reasons why it potentially might not work to scratch your own itch. If someone comes to me with a scratch your own itch, I usually say, “Great, now, find 10 other people who need it. Do some validation.” It’s not a hard and fast rule, but it gives you a little more certainty that it might be actually valuable. Did you do any validation, or did you just dive into the code?  Grant McConnaughey:So the timing of Postpone is really a big part of the story as well. I started in January, 2020 because I was managing, and just really missed building stuff. Then March, 2020 rolled around, and as we all know, COVID hit, we’re all staying at home. So the project turned into this something to work on for fun, and I really didn’t do a lot of validation because I just enjoyed working on it. I enjoyed having something that I could write about. So there wasn’t a lot of that validation, but over time, more and more people would find it, and then that’s where I would start. I didn’t seek validation, but it eventually came after building it for months and months just for fun really.  Rob Walling:Your day job was at Zapier. Everyone who’s listening to this would know it. So you were an engineer at Zapier, and then nights and weekends you were building Postpone. Did you launch in March so did it only take you a couple of months to get to enough of an MVP that you felt like others could use it?  Grant McConnaughey:My whole goal for the year was to make a single dollar online. It’s really just an excuse to sign up for a Stripe account, have a small enough goal to just do something that someone could send me some money for, and have some project that people hopefully find value in enough to pay for. Yeah, so I tried to get it out as quickly as possible. That MVP is embarrassing. I would love to go back and see a screenshot of it. I know that it would be so bare bones, but it did the MVP. It scheduled Reddit posts, told you how they performed, the very basic feature that you would expect in something like this, and got it out in about 10 weeks.  Rob Walling:So that’s where. Some software developers talk about when they look at the stair-step approach, and they look at a step one business, very simple thing. They say, “What if I can just ship the whole thing, or ship an MVP in four weeks, five weeks of nights and weekends especially?” I often say, “I don’t know if I’d validate then. If I can just ship.” So that’s actually a pretty quick way to validate. Maybe I’d have one conversation, or maybe I’d do a little less. But it’s not like, if I have to go six months, I need to know that there’s going to be some type of traction for this. Getting it out in 10 weeks, 10 weeks is not nothing, but especially nights and weekends, it’s pretty impressive. What was the reception like? Did you launch it on, did do Product Hunt, or Reddit, or Hacker News?  Grant McConnaughey:I did Reddit, Product Hunt, Twitter, Indie Hackers. I posted it everywhere. The reception was frankly crickets. You can put all this work into it, and do this big grand reveal, but at three or 400 followers at the time, there was mostly just, “oh, that’s cool. Yeah, good for you.” So it took quite a while to actually even get that first paying customer. I remember, I think it was July, so it took a few months to even get to that point of just… Kept working on it, talking about it, and got that first person to pay me $8 a month for a subscription at the time. Boy, that was one of the most exciting $8 I’ve ever made in my life when that finally happened.  Rob Walling:I love that. Do you have a memory of seeing the email, or getting the ding?  Grant McConnaughey:Yes. I was in my car, and saw it at the grocery store. I was like, “Holy cow.’ Someone in the world thinks something I made has enough value that they’re like, “Here’s eight bucks for that. Thank you.”  Rob Walling:Something I should have asked at the top was to give us an idea of where the business is at today.  Grant McConnaughey:It’s grown a ton since then. These days we’re up to still just a pretty small group of three of us, a scrappy group. I’m the only founder, but have since found a software engineer who’s excellent. I’ve worked with him before, and a support person. We’re now in the mid six figures, ARR range, and growing pretty well.  Rob Walling:Did you think when that $8 came through, “You know what, in a couple of years, mid six figures, I’m calling my shot. I’m Babe Ruth in it,” at a point?  Grant McConnaughey:Never. It took me two years to even accept that this is, I need to go all in on this. Very risk averse, and really got it to the point where it didn’t feel as risky anymore because it was making a true salary amount of ARR. So I felt I could go all in. So I really took it the slow, steady, and risk averse way. That’s my style.  Rob Walling:The style of many. So folks know the context. You launched it in March, you got to 1K MRR by the following January, so it took nine or 10 months.  Grant McConnaughey:It did, yeah. It took several months to get the first customer in the first place, and just slowly, slowly every month getting four customers, then eight customers, and then 20. It just kept growing.  Rob Walling:You did something, I would almost call this a growth hack. I know people don’t like that term. But you did kind of a growth hacky does not scale thing right at the start. You want to tell us about that?  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, so Reddit has a decent API that has a lot of great endpoints that you can get Reddit data. It’s really valuable, really good stuff. So in the early days, this is June, July, 2020, wrote some scripts to see who are the users who are submitting the most posts, because in theory, those are the folks who would most benefit from a scheduler like this. And tried to find who those common posters are across a bunch of different subreddits, and just sent cold DNs to see if they would be interested. As you can imagine, most cold DMs, most people didn’t say anything. Maybe 1% sent me a not so happy reply, but then every now and then a few people per day would be like, “That’s really cool. That’s awesome. I’ll check it out.” And it was a good fit for them. So the kind of thing that really doesn’t scale well, and haven’t done that in years, but in the early days it was a good way to just get anyone to care.  Rob Walling:You scrapped to 1K MRR in about nine or 10 months. Then you continued working full-time at Zapier until October, 2022 because you applied to TinySeed. You were doing 10K, or a little more than that when you applied?  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, it was north of 10K MRR at the time I quit. Funny enough, I’d actually put my notice in at Zapier, this is October, 2022, before getting accepted in the TinySeed, and then a week later got the email from you all that I had been accepted. So I really wanted to do this either way, but then when I got that email, it was like, “All right, this is the right thing to do for sure.”  Rob Walling:That is cool. Folks who listen to the show know that I don’t make the podcast an advertisement for TinySeed. So I have a couple of questions for you about your experience, not to say, “Well look how great TinySeed is.” But I’m curious, there was a thought process there of like, “Should I do TinySeed?” Why do it, is my question?  Grant McConnaughey:I talk to a lot of… I try to have as many mentors around me as I can. I really value other people’s input, especially folks who’ve done what I’m hoping to do. So I talk to a lot of people about, is this the right decision or not? Ultimately I just thought getting in this community of other people who are doing the exact same thing, especially as a solo founder who doesn’t have another founder to bounce ideas off of. I just thought there’s going to be so much value in the mentorship, the comradery of other folks who are also going through the TinySeed process at the same time as me, and have companies that are around the same size as mine. So it just ultimately felt like the right thing to do.  Rob Walling:Over the last year, you’ve grown by several X, right?  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, so since joining TinySeed in November of last year, it’s been about 13 months, but we’ve grown 3.4x annual recurring revenue in that time.  Rob Walling:That’s got to feel good. What’s been working? Someone listening to this is like, “Well, if I was at 10 or 12 KMRR, and I wanted to grow substantially,” why do you think you’re where you are today?  Grant McConnaughey:I think a big part of it’s hard to give an app a ton of, or a company a ton of focus as a side hustle. I really was giving Zapier my full 40 hours, and then working Saturday, Sunday mornings, evenings. But it’s just hard to really focus on big initiatives at a company when you’re doing something like that. So I think having the full time working on Postpone to really dive into like, what are the big things customers are asking for, not something I can just knock out on a Saturday morning. But a big multi-week initiative, a feature, or a new way to position the product that is going to have a really big impact. That kind of stuff has been night and day. You could see the line just trend differently as soon as I could start getting these really big, impactful, valuable features out much more quickly.  Rob Walling:Are you telling me that focus helped you grow faster?  Grant McConnaughey:Focus.  Rob Walling:Focus.  Grant McConnaughey:Just focusing on it, yeah, not splitting my attention.  Rob Walling:Well, why didn’t you launch four or five more apps to see what sticks? Because isn’t that, sorry, a little starter for the rest of a drinking game joke there. Yeah, you actually, I believe you published a graph on Twitter. It was with the MRR removed, but it was a graph of your MRR with no y-axis. There were two inflection points where you bootstrap or hockey stick. One, you pointed arrow, it said, “join TinySeed,” which I was like, “Oh, it warms my heart.” The second one was increased prices. So tell us about that. Was it little bit, was a lot bit of A\u0026R and I busting your chops, TinySeed playbook raise prices, or did you already have it in the back of your head?  Grant McConnaughey:It was almost exclusively you all busting my chops. I think A\u0026R and you both, we had a meetup at one point, I think you both said, “If we do nothing else but you get you all to raise your prices, by the end of this, we will have succeeded.”  Rob Walling:We will have succeeded, yeah. That’s pretty much the mantra.  Grant McConnaughey:I thought, “Well, I should probably do it right then.”  Rob Walling:So you did raise prices. Well, it was June of this year, so it was about six months ago, right?  Grant McConnaughey:Yes.  Rob Walling:That was when you locked, because you were Reddit only until then, I believe. And now you have Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. So you launched the Twitter support, and you increased your prices. About how much to give people an idea?  Grant McConnaughey:So about 20%. So we had a $19 a month plan that went up to 25. We had a $39 a month plan that went up to 49, and so on. So about 20, 25% or so increase. And yeah, tried to coincide with the launch of that of Twitter support so it didn’t just feel like increasing prices. It’s also, “Hey, I’m getting twice the value as I was before. I can now connect more accounts, manage them all from one platform, and paying a little bit extra. I don’t mind doing that.”  Rob Walling:Did you grandfather existing customers, or raise the prices on existing customers as well?  Grant McConnaughey:So I didn’t end up raising prices for everyone, despite the advice I got from several folks was to go ahead and just rip that bandaid off. But ultimately I decided to go with an approach where I introduce brand new plans but only include Twitter support on those new plans. So folks are grandfathered in on their old plans if they want to keep that they can. But these newer plans are where we’re going to start adding new platforms like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. So for access to those, you do have to upgrade. So it was a good way to entice folks to upgrade if they want to, but also not feel like they’re being forced to. What we found is a huge percentage of our customers use one of those other platforms, and gladly upgraded to the newer plans in order to bring on more accounts plus expanded it onto higher tiers in order to connect more accounts because we do limit some of our plan tiers by number of accounts connected. So it’s been great for both bringing in new customers, and expansion revenue as well.  Rob Walling:Got it. And your average revenue per account has gone up pretty substantially as well.  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, that was not just increasing prices, that was also adding higher tiers, which is where we started first. Just don’t have your highest tier be $99 a month because then no one can pay you more than $99 a month. So adding on those higher tiers I think went a long way as well.  Rob Walling:Because you have a more for agency’s plan, basically that’s above your 99. So when they come in, and people can go to Postpone app/plans if they want to see what you’ve added in there. So you didn’t have the agency plan at this point?  Grant McConnaughey:Not really, no. We had plans that would support multiple accounts, but we called it Ultimate or something like that. We weren’t really speaking the language of agencies themselves because we were mostly marketing toward creators. But it was a really missed opportunity for a long time to bring in these agencies who are willing to pay more, and churn less often as well. So it’s been really big for postpones a ARR.  Rob Walling:I often say that raising prices is technically easy to do. It’s like, “I’m going to change the stripe call. I’m going to change the number on my pricing page.” You do some stuff. Technically it’s usually not terrible. The big block is usually emotional. It’s a mental thing of like, “I might break my business. I’m going to make people mad. Is it even the right thing?” There’s a lot of, it’s a big change. It could break the business. Did you experience that before raising prices?  Grant McConnaughey:I did. It was scary to do. I had to have friends and just people I know come in, and talk me up a little bit to, “Hey, it’s going to be okay. You can always roll it back if it goes horribly.” So I finally did do it, but it was something I was pretty hesitant about, and was really afraid that new signups are just going to fall off a cliff if we do this. Shockingly, I’ve shown you the ARR graph. I can also show you the subscriptions graph. And it also went up. We raised prices, and number of subscriptions went up as well, which seemed completely countered to me, but that’s what had happened over the next few months as well.  Rob Walling:That’s incredible. It’s a good story. In most cases, that’s what happens. I’m invested 171 companies across TinySeed, and my own personal portfolio. Almost all those have raised prices at one point. If they haven’t, and they’re listening to this, they should raise the prices right now. But no, but seriously, the usual result is that everything goes up into the right, and obviously the counterintuitive part is you can raise prices too far. If you doubled all your prices today, it might work or it might not. At a certain point if you’re just priced too high, the alternatives are cheaper, they’re easier, they’re whatever, if you’re easy to switch away from, and there are alternatives, you just can’t. There’s only so much elasticity. But even with that in mind, I can’t remember the last time a TinySeed company raised their prices, and then had to roll it back. With every batch of companies every six months, we fund 20, 25, 27 companies, more than half of them, probably significantly more than half, raise their prices during the batch year. So that’s a lot. I don’t know the exact number, but obviously it’s dozens and dozens. It may approach a hundred, but it’s a lot. I cannot remember. I’ve had people raise prices, and need to change, “Oh, we got the value metric wrong.” Or, “We need to tweak the plan, we need to do some stuff.” But to raise prices, and then truly roll back. I don’t know that I remember a time when that’s happened. So it’s interesting, it’s anecdata. But nonetheless, it is usually the right call specifically if you haven’t done it in a while, or never done it, I think in your case, right?  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, well, I’ve done it a few times. Like I said, we launched with an $8 plan.  Rob Walling:That’s right.  Grant McConnaughey:I think our highest tier was $25 at launch.  Rob Walling:Got it.  Grant McConnaughey:But as at the time, I truly didn’t understand customers, and what they’d be willing to pay, what their price sensitivity was. But we hadn’t raised prices in over two years. I sent everyone an email, and really included this laundry list of like, this is all the amazing things we’ve added in the last two years, as well as this new Twitter support that we’re launching. I think that that really helped to show folks, the app has grown so much in that time, and there’s been so much extra value that you’ve been getting. It makes the price increases maybe just go down a little bit better. But frankly, I wish I would’ve done it six months earlier, or soon after joining TinySeed based on how well it went.  Rob Walling:That’s the thing, if you’re in a very slow moving space, you can evaluate prices every year or two. If you’re in a faster moving space, like marketing technology, MarTech, you’re in every six to 12 months to me, is an evaluation. Doesn’t mean you raise every time. But I used to have a notebook because I’m old school of all the major drip competitors. I would write down all the prices that were published, and about every six months, nine months, I would go and I’d redo that. I just had pages and pages in notebook. I would compare them and be like, “What are these other people doing?” That was a mental evaluation for me. I would also, and it wasn’t just, look, it’s not just competitors. What are your customers saying? What features have we added? Do we need to rework our value metric deal? Is it working, is it not? So there’s more to evaluation that’s looking at competitors. But that’s where fast moving space like yours, I do think that if you’re not pretty seriously considering changing your prices, raising them, or tweaking value metric about every year, think you’re going to fall behind a little bit.  Grant McConnaughey:Part of what makes it scary is, once you realize you’re raising your prices, and becoming maybe the most, your prices are now a little bit higher than some of your competition. There are other post schedulers out there certainly. But the Reddit space is pretty niche still. And of the ones that do exist, their prices are a little bit lower. So just coming to accept that we’re going to be the higher priced one, but that’s going to be because we offer so much extra value that you simply can’t get from competitors in a much better package, and just being okay with not being the least expensive one.  Rob Walling:We’re not cheap because we’re not cheap. There’s an ad, I think I mentioned it in the episode that went live last week about you don’t have to be the cheapest and own that actually. No, we’re not cheap because we’re the best. You can’t get anywhere near this from other tools. Speaking of Reddit, I remember a Reddit API debacle that happened, say in the last four or five months. There’s folks listening, if they didn’t pay attention, you want to catch them up on what happened, and I want to drive home. You are a scheduling app for Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, but you are solely Reddit for what, two years? And that is still the bulk of your business. So to hear that the Reddit API had this platform risk, that’s what we’re going to talk about here. But to hear that, that had some difficulties, I remember stressed you out a lot. You and I talked, we did some Zoom calls, we did some slacks, and it was a little bit tenuous. So why don’t you tell the full story because this is great. I think for people to hear, to understand platform risk sometimes doesn’t work out, and sometimes you can get around it.  Grant McConnaughey:It was definitely a scary time. It was in April, 2023, I think when Reddit-  Rob Walling:It’s nine months ago.  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, they announced some new API pricing, but they weren’t specific about what the pricing would be. They just said that API pricing is coming, and will be required. It’ll be required to pay for the API essentially. So that just inherently, you get a little hesitant because you don’t know what that means, and is this an existential risk or not?  Rob Walling:I think hadn’t Twitter just done their API thing where they were like, suddenly we’re charging $12,000 a month or some insane number.  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah, it started at 42,000,  Rob Walling:Forty-two thousand a month, it’s bananas. So I remember you and I got on a call, and you’re like, “I’m concerned Reddit’s going to charge 42,000 a month because then we can’t.”  Grant McConnaughey:Well, exactly. That was a big part of it. If the pricing is fine, no big deal. Happy to pay it. If it’s $42,000 a month, then there’s the existential risk. You just got to close up shop. And to be clear to folks, the Twitter pricing has changed as well. They now have a hundred dollar tier, $5,000 tier, and $42,000 tier. So they have added multiple tiers since then. But Reddit did come forward with their API pricing about six weeks later in May. And fortunately for Postpone, it was something that just based on the nature of our business, the average revenue per user, and the number of API calls we make, totally doable, ended up working out just fine. For third party Reddit clients who have a huge amount of free users, who are using tons of API calls all day every day, it was an existential risk, unfortunately for many of them, and much lower average revenue per user for those as well because they’re very B2C mobile apps. But fortunately for Postpone, it was something that we could handle, and ended up not being a big issue. But for a while there it was like, “What do we do? This could be it right here,” because we had all the eggs in the Reddit basket at the time.  Rob Walling:It was touch and go. I remember you were pretty stressed because it was truly potentially existential that it would destroy the company, and there was no, you hadn’t launched. Now I’m remembering you said it was April, so you hadn’t launched Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok, right? Those came in June, I think.  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah. Honestly, that’s where the benefit of being a TinySeed really came up because we added Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok because of a conversation I had with you where you said, “I think it’s just time to expand.” It was a great way for Postpone to diversify a bit. I think it was definitely the right call.  Rob Walling:And also a way to get a little more MRR, little more average revenue per [inaudible 00:25:26]  Grant McConnaughey:More MRR, make it a little more sticky. Lots of benefits that came with diversifying.  Rob Walling:Well, I’m glad the platform risk didn’t wipe you off the face of the earth this time.  Grant McConnaughey:Me too. But it is. It’s scary. There are folks who built Twitter apps who, their app didn’t exist after the $42,000 a month pricing came out, and they just had to close up shop. So it’s something that I think about quite a bit. Platform risk is real. So I have to keep that in mind and really ask whether it’s something you can work around, or if it’s truly existential.  Rob Walling:I think I want to wrap up with this question of, you’re a successful bootstrap, mostly bootstrap entrepreneur. You’re in an enviable position that I think a lot of listeners of this podcast would love to be in. With that in mind, what do you wish that you were doing better right now as the founder, operator, and CEO of Postpone?  Grant McConnaughey:Great question. I started working on Postpone as a software engineer at Zapier. Really wonderful company that I enjoyed working with them, but I just wanted to build these other skill sets as well. But I’ve found that in building Postpone, building up this product, and a small company, I still spend a lot of my time building, working on product stuff. I still feel like an engineer at heart. You simply have to focus on marketing as well. If I could go back, I would tell myself to spend three times as much as I’m spending on marketing over the last couple of years, whether that’s working on SEO building landing pages, especially signing up for affiliate programs that your users can join, and things like that. Don’t get into a rut of just building, and building, and thinking, “If I build this feature, then they will come,” because they might not. So definitely sticking with marketing would be a big thing for me to focus on. Huge recommendation to the book. I think it is called, Traction?  Rob Walling:By Gabriel Weinberg.  Grant McConnaughey:Yeah. Finding customer acquisition channels, trying out new ways of that. A Huge shout-out to that book, which really kind of opened my eyes to how to start getting a little bit of leverage on these different marketing avenues, and really doubling down on the ones that work.  Rob Walling:Grant McConnaughey, it’s been great having you on the show. You are, G McConnaughey on Twitter. We will link that up in the show notes because your last name is not the easiest to spell.  Grant McConnaughey:It is not, no.  Rob Walling:We will also try to find your tweet with the graph of your MRR because I thought that was really cool. We’ll link that in the show notes as well. Thanks again for coming on the show, man.  Grant McConnaughey:Sounds good. Thank you so much, Rob. I appreciate it.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Grant for coming on the show. It’s great to be back in the saddle doing some interviews. I’m done with a ton of travel this fall. So I’m trying to schedule a few guests to come on the show. I look forward to seeing you back again next week.

And look, if you’re selling to other developers, maybe that’s true, but the moment that you step outside of that and you start selling to anyone who is not writing code 40 hours a week, you need to seriously rethink your approach and to think, not of how you buy, but how do they buy. Welcome back to The Startups For the Rest of Us. Today is a Rob’s Solo Adventure where I’m going to talk about making sure that your product works. Talk about how little you’ve proven until someone gives you money, why not being the cheapest option can be good for your positioning. And maybe one or two more topics depending on how the time shakes out. Before we dive into that, tickets for MicroConf US in Atlanta next April 2024 are on sale. This event will sell out. If you’re thinking about coming to Atlanta, April 21st through the 23rd to see me co-host this event with Lianna Patch and to see speakers like myself, Rand Fishkin, and several others, head to microconf.com/us to grab your ticket before they sell out. We had an amazing event just a few months ago in Denver, and I expect the event in Atlanta to be no different. So microconf.com/us to grab your ticket today. So the first topic I want to cover today was actually sent to me by content producer, Ron. He helps make sure the podcast gets out on time and is really in charge of getting the YouTube videos all through our editing and production process and out every week, 52 YouTube videos a year, 52 episodes of Startups For the Rest of Us per year. In that role, producer Ron gets a lot of cold email outreach. In this case, I actually got the cold email and it was AI for podcasters. And so that sounds intriguing, could this be something we could use that could help us get the podcast out faster? So I forwarded that to producer Ron. He signed up with a credit card. He tried the app, didn’t work. I think it crashed or 404’d or something that obviously just didn’t produce a result. So he left. He came back later that day or the next day, tried it again, still didn’t work. So he says, “All right, my credit card’s on file.” So he goes to unsubscribe in the app, can’t do it. So he has to get on chat or email with the support person and he says, “I need to unsubscribe.” And the support person didn’t ask anything, didn’t ask why, didn’t ask if it worked, just said, “Okay.” And so think about the level of effort, the amount of time and money that was just wasted and the opportunity that was just wasted by not having their signup flow and their application working as it should be. It’s you have one job and the job is to make sure someone gets through your flow and then that they just get that first very simple use case. This is not a complicated app. It’s not as if you’re logging into marketing automation where there’s 50 different features and one of them broke. It is basically a one, maybe a two feature app. It’s kind of just a feature wrapped in a web page. And the challenge is we are actually a really easy customer to sell to. We pay money, we self-sign up. If it works and it’s great, we don’t need to talk to anybody. We self-onboard. We have budget. It’s crazy. So I think the big takeaway here for me is when was the last time you or someone on your team went through your own onboarding and actually tried what you think the first feature people should try is or that first step of the onboarding flow? This is one of those things that can easily get lost and forgotten because you deploy it once and you polish it up and then a year later your app, your positioning, your entire funnel, even maybe even your ideal customer profile has changed. But we just forget to revisit those first few steps, those first few moments that are so critical for new customers. So hopefully this can serve as a public service announcement for you to either assign it to someone on your team or to just step through your onboarding and try to travel your minimum path to awesome, that first spark where you think, “Man, this is a really cool piece of software.” And make sure that that is not only frictionless, but that it works. My second topic is from a cold pitch. Someone cold emailed me saying they had a B2B SaaS app. The idea was interesting. I’ve never invested in an app where the founders have cold emailed me. It’s always through, it has traditionally been through MicroConfs, and of course now it’s through TinySeed. But I believe someone emailed me and I was trying to size them up to figure out are they a fit for TinySeed, either the accelerator or our investment syndicate. And they had a good story and they had a solid founding team. I like the app idea. I think I went back and forth once or twice and I was like, “Great, what’s your revenue?” And this sentence, I’ve heard this in the past, I’ve heard it multiple times, which is why I’m bringing it up now. This sentence always kills me. Sentence was, “We are pre-revenue still as we have been focusing on early user acquisition with a free offering.” And that makes me cringe. Because unless you’re a pretty experienced entrepreneur or free really well, don’t do this. This is the early entrepreneur’s trap. Yeah, that’s what it is. I talk about several big mistakes, common mistakes that founders make in the SaaS playbook, and one of them is translating your app to other languages to or early or it’s white labeling or adding other verticals too early, underpricing your product, right? These common mistakes that folks make. Another one is thinking that free users offer any value. Now, if you’re a second, third, fourth time entrepreneur, if you really know free, if you have listened to Ruben Gamez, speak about it. If you’ve listened to me take Ruben Gamez’s four criteria for when free plans work and you’ve heard me say them on this podcast, then maybe you try it out. But what I find is it’s an excuse for doing something hard, which is charging people. It’s an excuse for at a minimum telling people, “I’m going to charge you when you get value from this product.” The first several months of Drip, as I was hand onboarding new customers, first 10 or 20, I would say, “Look, I’m not even going to take a credit card from you. Get in. Let me help you get onboarded. Let me know how much help you need. When you start seeing value from it, let’s get a credit card on file. It’s going to be 49 bucks a month.” And some people got onboarded in a week and some people got onboarded in six weeks. And in fact, it helped me understand how long I thought that our trial should be once we were automating this. But had I just told them, “Oh yeah, it’s just free. I’m just getting free users.” Unless there is a network effect where getting free users actually increases the value of your business, in almost every case, almost every case, I see of an early stage or a new entrepreneur trying this, it’s a mistake. Because it’s noisy as it is when you have 10 or a hundred or 500 users of an application. There’s so much noise. You don’t know who to listen to, you don’t know what to build. You’re getting conflicting, distracting reports of, “Build this feature. Pivot this way. Have you thought of just replicating all of Mailchimp’s functionality inside your app and adding a mobile Android and iOS apps?” It’s too much already. And if you’re doing it free, what you’re doing is not segmenting your customers to find out who really needs this. Who is this truly a pain point for? Because if it’s painful, someone should be willing to pay for that. And if they’re not, it’s probably time to move on. Right? On this podcast I talk about B2B SaaS that solves a problem, a pain point that people are willing to pay for, people in businesses are willing to pay for. And so if you are not able to charge someone something and you’re getting free beta users, “Free beta users,” I’m doing air quotes for those of you listening to the audio, you have proven so very little until someone gives you money. Specifically with B2B SaaS, you’ve proven almost nothing until someone gives you their credit card. I want to talk about my third topic of the day, and it’s around positioning about not being the cheapest option. So every once in a while on Instagram, I come across an ad that I really like, and I think several companies have copied this ad. I don’t know which one was the original, but I’ve seen it for pens, I’ve seen it for shoes. And the one I have in front of me is for socks. But I like the tone of it, the confidence of it. The headline is, this ad is for socks. And the headline is, “They’re not cheap because they’re not cheap. It’s not cheap to make a sock that lasts four times longer than cotton. It’s not cheap to create a merino wool that won’t lose its shape. It’s not cheap to reduce waste by 80%. It’s not cheap, but it makes a big difference. Introducing Aerowool, four times the life of Cotton. Twice the performance, one fourth of the waste.” That was an ad read for Aerowool, but you get the idea, the confidence. They’re not making excuses, they’re not trying to be Walmart. And this is how I’ve often felt about the businesses I built, specifically TinySeed. I was at a dinner with a friend, kind of in the broader MicroConf ecosystem within the last six months, and they are not a founder and they don’t raise money and they don’t know much about fundraising, but they said, “Yeah, someone told me that TinySeed money is expensive.” And I said, “Yeah, that’s true.” We are not the cheapest money. By design, we are not the cheapest money. If you want cheap money, go to a doctor down the street, a dentist, maybe a local angel group, go try to raise on Sand Hill Road, go to one of kind of the copycat like the tier B, tier C funds, whether they’re indie funds or whether they are major venture funds. Those have cheap money because they have no differentiator. Right? They don’t have world-class mentors like TinySeed. They don’t have the Hiten Shah, the Claire Suellentrop, the April Dunford, Asia Orangio, Chris Savage, Rand Fishkin, Jordan Gal, Steli Efti, DHH, Jason Fried. They don’t have that mentor list, right? It is a who’s who of B2B SaaS. You can go to tinyseed.com/people if you want to see the full mentor list. They don’t have myself and Einar Vollset giving you advice. They don’t have a year-long program. They don’t have the best B2B SaaS alumni network with 151 companies, 250, 275 founders. And look, this piece here, I want to be super clear, not an ad for TinySeed, but what I’m telling you is the reason that we are able to not be the cheapest money is because of the value we provide. We’re not a commodity, right? When you’re a commodity, then it’s a race to the bottom and it’s who can get it here the fastest and the cheapest at a quality that’s good enough that it doesn’t break. And in thinking about your own positioning, I’m not saying everyone needs to be the premium play. In fact, if you can find a hated competitor that has artificially kept prices up because of their brand or because of the space or because of their sales model, you can slip in underneath them and actually be less expensive and have an amazing product, there’s a real opportunity there. But for me, by the time I’m building a brand, by the time I’m at a million ARR, 2 million ARR, and people list me as one of the top two or three options in a space. I say, list me, they list my product, my company, as one of the top two or three options in a space. That’s when I’m starting to think about pricing power. Because now people are coming to me, to my product by name. They’re not just looking for a generic replacement and looking for the cheapest option. So in this conversation, I actually posted this in the team TinySeed Slack. Because I said, “I like the thinking about this, and this is how I think of TinySeed. We’re not the cheapest money and there’s all these reasons.” And Alex, who’s our program director in Europe for our EMEA program, he rewrote the ad just in our Slack and posted it. And I want to read that here because I like it. He said, “Our funding isn’t cheap because we’re not cheap. It’s not cheap to build a program that’s four times longer than the average accelerator. It’s not cheap to create a world-class group of industry-leading mentors. It’s not cheap to connect a network of hundreds of SaaS founders through events worldwide. It’s not cheap, but when it comes to your business’s growth, it makes a big difference.” Thanks, Alex. I use that without permission. I’m sure he won’t mind. But I liked that thinking of if you are going to be the premium brand, don’t apologize for it. In fact, do the opposite. Point out that you are more expensive and why. Get ahead of the objections by saying, “We are not the cheapest option.” And in fact, go to Instagram and type in, “We’re not cheap.” And maybe see if one of these ads comes up. Because every time I see it, I get a little smile on my face and I think, “This is not lazy marketing. That’s pretty cool, creative marketing.” Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

I’ve referenced them several times on the show, actually pulled, it’s one of those, it’s two comic artists. They’re comic creators, they’re entrepreneurs, and they do Kickstarters and Patreon and they have books and they have stuff online. And it’s neat to see the overlap between startup founders and comic, these two comic artists as well as the things that are different. And that’s why I listen to the show. I love going into other disciplines that are tangentially related to see what I can learn. And so in a recent show, one of the hosts said, “Are you doing mirror research or market research?” Mirror research is when I look in the mirror and I say, “Well, this is what I would prefer. Therefore, that’s what everyone would prefer.” Market research is when you listen to prospects, customers and your broader market. Developers are famous for this. For saying, “Well, I would never pay for that because I could build it in a weekend. I would never pay for that because I could cobble it together in no code, low code or some other form. I don’t like to talk to salespeople, so I’m not going to do sales.” No one likes talking to salespeople. “I’m not going to do demos because they don’t work. They’re annoying. I’m not going to have high prices or have prices that increase with the value someone gets because I don’t like that kind of pricing. I don’t like that with MailChimp that as I get more subscribers, I pay more money. So I’m going to start a competitor where it’s just flat pricing for infinity subscribers.” And that last one is actually kind of what BeHive is doing right now and they’re having success with it. So I could talk about that as a case study on another episode. Right now, I’m just giving examples of perhaps anti-patterns of getting in your own head and staying in your own head and thinking that just because you prefer it, that your customers do as well and that your market does as well. And look, if you’re selling to other developers, maybe that’s true, but the moment that you step outside of that and you start selling to anyone who is not writing code 40 hours a week, you need to seriously rethink your approach and to think, not of how you buy, but how do they buy. To think not how you approach a purchase process, onboarding and retention, but how do your customers and your market think about this. And the way to get educated on that is to have conversations with them, to observe them as they use your application and to ask a lot of questions and figure out who’s succeeding and who is not, and what can we do differently to help more of them succeed rather than stand in front of a mirror and ask, “How would I like to buy and assume that my insurance agents,” if that’s who I’m serving, “Are going to in any way think anything like I do,” because they’re probably not. So that was mirror research versus market research. My last topic of the day is about ventriloquism and how it doesn’t work in comics, but realistically, it pulls from the Pablo Picasso quote that says, “Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist.” And I have a couple examples of this actually. I think this really drives home with SaaS in the sense that if you want to do something creative, like have a free plan in a B2C two-sided marketplace, first learn the rules of the common pitfalls that people run into. Right? So if you’re thinking about doing a free plan, maybe launch an app without a free plan and learn how that works first or maybe have a lot of conversations with folks who have actually made free plans work. Don’t just gut your way into it. Learn the rules of what makes them work and not before doing it. I think of this with all the rules of thumb I have around should you ask for credit card upfront or not? Should you do demo only or should you offer demo plus start a trial as an option? What are the rules of thumb around B2B SaaS pricing? There’s a lot of them around enterprise pricing. There’s all these rules, and they’re not rules, they’re rules of thumb, they’re guidelines. And now that I have them kind of locked in my head and all lodged as this whole framework, again, that I kind of bled onto the page, so to speak, for the SaaS playbook. That’s my most recent book, saasplaybook.com, if you haven’t read it. But now that I have them in my head, I kind of have a gut feel of when they should be broken because I know the rules, rules of thumb that is, because there are no rules. Right? There’s no hundred percents, but there’s a lot of eighties and 90 percents. 80, 90 percent of the time you should do this unless you have a really good reason not to. So in SaaS, it’s pretty obvious to me that this idea of coming in not knowing any of the rules, you’re likely going to make some really basic missteps. The common mistakes, I referenced some of them earlier, but there are dozens of them. Things SaaS founders should never do. I talked about this, what? Five, 10 episodes ago. Those are the rules of thumb that you should learn and then learn when to break them. And the example I referenced earlier is about ventriloquism not working in comics. I would never even think about ventriloquism in comics. But referencing Comic lab, again, they were talking about this rule between the two of them of how trying to have ventriloquism in a written art form, a visual written art form, like a comic. Imagine Garfield or Calvin and Hobbes and them trying to do ventriloquism. You could pull it off, but you really need to know how to do it. It doesn’t really work in comics unless you are an expert, unless you’ve learned the rules so you can learn how to break them. And I loved that analogy of it because again, this is something I just would never think about because I’m not a visual artist, can’t draw to save my life, but I love that thought of, it’s just kind of a rule of thumb. And they talk to a lot of beginners, right? That write into their show and they’re like, “Yeah, it just doesn’t work in comics.” Basically, don’t try it. And then the other example that I thought of as I was talking to someone about Rob Walling Drinking Game, the Beatles, and they were asking, why were the Beatles early songs so kind of generic and poppy? You go back to 62, 63, 64 and you have She Loves You and Please Please Me and I Want to Hold Your Hand. I still enjoy these songs, but they aren’t very deep compared to Sgt. Pepper’s and A Day in The Life and Strawberry Fields Forever, even Yesterday, Let It Be, Hey Jude, these amazing songs that are timeless and some of the certainly, inarguably some of the best songs of all time. But you compare it to their early work and they do covers and they write just a lot of kind of catchy poppy four chord songs. And I was trying to explain why that was. And I was like, “Hey, it was a sign of the times.” That’s how everyone else sounded. And then the Beatles, once they were number one, they just started innovating. And so they drove really the shape and the direction of music in the mid to late 60s. But realistically, I think a big piece of this is that Picasso quote, “They were learning the rules so they could learn how to break them.” The early songs sounds so old because they had to conform to the norms of the day to get on the radio. Right? They had great songwriting at the time, but it was very much this template of this three minute song with a verse, a chorus, a verse, of chorus, a middle eight with a solo and then a verse, a chorus and an ending. And then they got popular. And once they got popular and their name was recognized and their name was a brand, then they could start getting creative. If they’d been creative before getting on the radio and being really popular and selling a lot of albums, they probably would’ve never gotten popular. So then they could start setting the trends, right? No other songwriters, popular songwriters of the day were doing introspection about themselves, like the song In My Life. And Yesterday. They were doing deep topics, psychedelic topics like on Revolver or even Sgt. Pepper’s and Magical Mystery Tour. And after that, pretty much whatever they did was considered ahead of its time and cutting-edge. And in fact, that stuff that they recorded on a lot of four tracks and a few eight tracks, which is mind-blowing, they recorded it 60 years ago, still holds up today. But the Beatles had to learn the rules first, and they had to conform to the standards of that day just to get on the radio before they could break so many of the norms of music and songwriting of the day. Speaking of the day, I’m about to call it a day.

If there’s a network effect, like a two-sided marketplace or where everyone being there means everyone stays there. Think about eBay and Craigslist. These sites that so many people have tried to copy, including Amazon, tried to copy eBay, they had their own auctions. So, I mean, there’s been all these things that have tried to unseat eBay and Craigslist and they couldn’t because even though the sites didn’t change, it didn’t improve. They have tremendous network effects. And so, if the legacy trade organizations and associations you’re talking about have network effects as a bootstrapper, I personally would be very wary of trying to unseat those. Welcome back to Startups for the Rest of Us. I’m Rob Walling. And if you want to see one of the worst hair days I’ve had in years, go to twitter.com/startupspod and check out the clip from today’s episode. In today’s episode, I am going to be answering a handful of listener questions ranging from having a free version with an honor system to pay for it, how to gain traction against entrenched competition, doing sales as an introverted founder, and how to proceed if you don’t have time for the stair step method of entrepreneurship. Before we dive into today’s questions, if you haven’t checked out my YouTube channel, it’s at microconf.com/youtube. I’m putting out 52 YouTube videos a year with topics ranging from new SaaS ideas that you should build. Looking at acquisition funnels, high touch, low touch, talking about sales, talking about the SaaS sheet codes, pulling some things out of my book and expanding on them. It’s free and it’s easy to subscribe. microconf.com/youtube if you’re interested. And with that, let’s dive in to our first listener question, which is a voicemail because voicemails go to the top of the stack.  Speaker 2:Hi Rob, and thanks for the show and books. I recently launched my first product, a vulnerability scanner, available at opalopc.com. It is a desktop application. It is free for non-commercial use and for commercial use only for small organizations. The rest need to buy license to use it. I currently trust users to buy licenses if they are not eligible for free use. The program does not do any license checking itself. My reasoning behind this is that those interested can freely test the product, and the target market consists of very large organizations, and I doubt they will take the risk of breaching the end user license agreement. What do you think of this? Should I remove the free plan? How would you continue? Keep up the good work. Thanks.  Rob Walling:So, I’ll be honest, I struggle with this ’cause it feels like just one step above a tip jar of saying, “Hey, if you like us, support us.” I know that you will have a license such that big companies won’t want to break that license, but I’ll be honest, there are a bunch of people, individual contributors at big companies that will download it and just never say anything. You’re going to lose out on revenue, and I’ve never loved the model where I get a small bit of money from a very small percentage of my audience. I feel like if people get value out of my software, I want them to pay for it. Now, the exception of course is freemium having a free plan, and in that case, we look at our four, I don’t know, rules or rules of thumb around freemium, which of course were swiped as most of my good ideas are from Ruben Gomez of SignWell. And one of them is there a tiny bit of virality such that another user using it can potentially refer a separate user. Is it low support? Is it low onboarding? And is there almost no cost to you for them to use the software? And my guess is the last three are accurate, probably no virality for you. So, I guess the question is does it need to truly be free forever? Or could it be a 14 day, a 30 day, a 60-day free trial that then stops working at a certain point? That’s probably a default way I think about it or having your version so limited to where if it’s a vulnerability scanner, maybe there’s 500 types of vulnerabilities and it only scans for 50 or 100. And so, to actually get value out of it ’cause if I’m an individual user, a consumer, and I want the full value, shouldn’t I upgrade? And enter a license key such that it unlocks those. I don’t know. It feels to me like having a true free consumer version. I know that’s how WinZip made their money back in the days. “Oh man, that’s a throwback. Remember WinZip?” And there was that old Winamp player thing from Microsoft, I believe. I mean, but it is Microsoft. They have infinity money and can do whatever free they want. If I was bootstrapping this and actually trying to make money on it, freemium pushes out your revenue, right? It pushes out that revenue line, and if you have a bunch of funding, that’s okay. And you can play the long game like Dropbox did. And the other freemium players that we could mention off the top of our head, Figma, that was one, right? But if you’re bootstrapping, you’re trying to get to the point where you’re quitting your job. While I may have a free version, I personally would kind of want there to be more impetus than just honor system for someone to pay me money because my gut is even of the people who should pay you money, it’s going to be one in 10, one in 50, just some tiny, tiny number. And unless I get a cajillion installs of this thing, you need hundreds of thousands of installs of this in order to make any type of real money. And that’s tough ’cause you’re getting tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of anything is hard if you’ve built it. So that’s my take. I mean, I’m more of the SaaS mindset rather than the old school. You’re almost talking Shareware is what you’re talking, and that model is not one that I personally would return to. So, thanks for your question. I hope that was helpful. Our next question is from Zach.  Zach:Hi Rob. My name is Zach and I’m a new listener to the Startups for the Rest of Us podcast. I’ve already listened to a few episodes and bought The SaaS Playbook and read it in two or three days, and it was a fantastic read and would recommend it for anyone looking to start a software company. My question is in regards to competition and maybe some use cases that I just haven’t heard before, I’ve tried to search online, but my niche is in the local government space and the competition would be dominated by legacy trade organizations or associations. Curious if there’s been a product or a company that has gone up against these behemoth legacy companies who, in my opinion, aren’t innovating and aren’t providing a valuable product, but it’s well known throughout the industry. So, curious if you’ve had that before or if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear it. Thanks so much.  Rob Walling:Okay. So, this depends on a couple of things. Realistically, I don’t quite understand what your businesses or exactly how you’re competing, but when I think about it, if I’m competing against incumbents, big, entrenched incumbents, I usually don’t care because I know I can outmaneuver them, but there are some exceptions to that. If there’s a network effect, like a two-sided marketplace or where everyone being there means everyone stays there. Think about eBay and Craigslist, these sites that so many people have tried to copy, including Amazon, tried to copy eBay, they had their own auctions. Did Amazon try to copy Craigslist too? I mean, there’s been all these things that have tried to unseat eBay and Craigslist and they couldn’t because even though the sites didn’t change, it didn’t improve. They have tremendous network effects. And so, if the legacy trade organizations and associations you’re talking about have network effects as a bootstrapper, I personally would be very wary of trying to unseat those. The second thing is switching costs and switching frequency maybe ’cause if folks, let’s say big construction firms and often governments will sign two, three, four-year contracts for their software, and if you’re trying to get people to switch, they literally cannot without eating a bunch of money for years. So, a, if there’s a lock-in there in terms of duration of contract, but beyond that, switching costs are brutal, right? Imagine if you are like Planify, which is a TinySeed company that builds software for construction firms to run their business on their entire business system. The switching costs to or from them is huge. You have to train all of your employees, everybody out in the field, everyone in the office, and you have to get everybody up to speed and on one day just flip it over and you just hope it works. And these are not… It’s not tech-savvy people, right? You’re not dealing with the people who work at TinySeed, right? Or the people who work at MicroConf where we all know how to use Trello. And so, moving to Notion wasn’t that big of a deal and building something in Airtable, we just kind of figured it out. You’re dealing with folks who I’ll say like my dad who worked 42 years in construction, he kind of knows how to use a computer. I mean, that’s about it, right? He’ll call me and say, “I can’t find where Firefox is.” ‘Cause the shortcut from the homepage got deleted and he doesn’t know where to find it, right? So that’s can be the level you’re dealing with. And so, switch and costs are a big deal because the retraining and getting people up to speed is tough. So, I’m not saying don’t do it if they’re a big switching costs, but if they’re big switching costs, like I would want to enter a space where new people are coming in all the time, right? Let’s say I build trip email service provider competed with Mailchimp. Switching costs are not that high, but in mentally people think they are, but there are new people coming in all the time just getting started and new people with kind of email lists that want to move it to an official ESP or whatever. So, while there were switching costs, there was also a lot of opportunity each month for new people who were looking for a solution. If you don’t have that and you have high switching costs and you’re literally trying to pull them from entrenched competitors, it’s going to be tough. I’m not saying don’t do it, but those are the two headwinds I’d think about. The third one is brand, right? Do they have a strong brand and does everyone love them? Then there’s no reason to switch unless people are complaining or there’s an actual problem like, “Oh, they’re so expensive. They don’t actually do anything for the money. Oh yeah, we all hate them, but we’re just with them because they’re the only option.” Well, now I start thinking, “Okay. How hard is it to switch?” And if one person at a time or one company at a time switches to my software, do they get the same value or do I need a hundred or a thousand to switch out once because there’s a network effect, right? Again, coming back to if it was a network effect thing, I probably wouldn’t do it or I would seriously consider not doing it. Now, if you weren’t talking about trade organizations and associations and city governments, local governments, I guess you said it’s a whole different story, right? Because if we’re going into MarTech marketing technology where the switching costs are low and there are no network effects, and there are some big brands in the space, but people don’t like, I mean, there is huge opportunity in my opinion, but that’s not the question you asked, so I answered it with the information given. So, thanks for the question, Zach.

So Bavesh asks, “What makes a SaaS product a low-touch strategy? If all the competitors are undertaking a high-touch sales strategy, can a low-touch sales strategy be possible?” So, the answer to the latter question is yes, it can. The answer to the first question of what makes a SaaS product a low-touch strategy, there’s a couple of things, right? So, if you aren’t charging very much, it kind of has to be low touch, but you really have to do the touch strategy to support the way that your customers buy. If they all want demos and they all want high touch sales and onboarding, then that’s what you do to get the most customers. That’s just what you do. You adapt to what the customers want. Here’s the kicker. If they all want high touch, but they’re super cash strapped, let’s say they’re a school or a library or a nonprofit and they need the high touch, but they’re only willing to pay $30 a month, that’s a tough business. I don’t say bad business, but I would never start that business because you’re going to need a lot of person hours that aren’t justified based on the average revenue per account per month or the lifetime value or the annual contract value. Whatever you want to say, you’re just not making enough money to justify it. So, usually I look at how do the customers want to buy, and in some spaces like construction firms buying their business system, I was just talking about with Planify, they’re not going to self-serve, always going to go through a really long sales process. I think most lawyers like if you’re serving legal, they want to do usually there’s at least a demo or a conversation. If you’re selling to developers or marketing technology or to entrepreneurs, there’s a split. Usually with developers, there’s more low touch, no touch. With entrepreneurs there’s a subset who are not as technical, but I think of the startup founders, I shouldn’t say entrepreneurs broadly, but more kind of technical, semi-technical startup founders. The more technical they are, oftentimes they want that lower touch, but that’s a generalization. And so, once you enter a space, it’s like getting to know your customer, right? Getting to know your prospects, how they want to buy, and then realizing, can I charge enough to make it worth that level of effort? And to go back to your second question, which is if all the competitors have a high touch strategy, can a low touch strategy be possible? The answer is yes. If your customers are willing to buy on the low touch, and in fact, if you can then charge a lot less and have a great product and make it simpler because there’s a certain subset that don’t want high touch. I’ll give you an example, Infusionsoft, which is now known as Keap, I think it’s spelled K-E-A-P. They did high touch only and their marketing automation, by the way. They did high touch only and they were like three or $400 a month and up, so they were priced high, and they did this sales strategy. When I launched Drip, we had a decent subset of their functionality once we got automations and we had, you could say 80% of their marketing automation functionality. Now they have other stuff built in a shopping cart. We weren’t going to build affiliate management, blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of email marketing and marketing automation, we had enough of their functionality that a good chunk of their users could use us. And I went with a low touch strategy, frankly, a lower no touch, and I think we did have a book, a demo, and it was only if you were over $100 a month or whatever, we would do a demo, but otherwise you could self-serve, and our pricing was way cheaper because the sales model supported it. And so, we got a ton of Infusionsoft refugees that didn’t like the sales strategy, they didn’t want to buy that way, but they were being forced into it. And so, there was opportunity. The hard part is figuring out how do people want to buy if I’m not in the space? How do you figure that out? And that really is the question. It’s by talking to people, by being in forums, by being in the Facebook groups, by being in the Slack groups, hearing people complain, “Oh my gosh.” At the time Infusionsoft requires a one-year annual commit and a $2,000 onboarding fee, and their support is crap. They don’t let you see the product before you buy, and it’s a heavy sales process, and dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. So, I looked at that and said, “Our product is a lot easier to use, therefore, we don’t need all the onboarding and all this other stuff. And I know that we can make money charging starting at 50 a month and that there will be expansion revenue.” Which there was. And that frankly, we could have net negative churn if there’s enough expansion revenue which there was. And therefore, I knew that we could undercut them on price and change the sales model and really take a lot of their disgruntled customers away, which is what we did. So, thanks for that question Bavesh. Hope it was helpful. My next question is about doing sales as an introverted founder.  Jordan:Hey, Rob. I’m Jordan from the Netherlands. I’ve been listening to the show for about six months, and I absolutely love the show. So, thanks a lot. I’m a developer myself and have a question about introverted versus extroverted founders. So, on the show, you mentioned founders doing the sales up to a certain point of the business, and to me, that makes total sense. But as a more introverted person, I’ve always found sales to be difficult, perhaps more difficult than for more extroverted people, or yeah, at least that’s my assumption. So, I’m kind of curious where you see yourself on the extroverted versus introverted scale and what advice you have for founders that are more introverted when it comes to sales. Thanks a lot, Rob. Bye-bye.  Rob Walling:I like this question. So, to answer, I think it was your last one first. Where do I fit on the scale? So, I’m introverted. And there’s a reason that I talk to a microphone and a video camera instead of hanging out with a bunch of people. While I do this, I enjoy thinking and talking one-on-one or alone, frankly, as you all have heard me do for however many hundreds of solo adventures that I’ve recorded. I’m an introvert. And so, I definitely get drained when I go to big events, even though I run them, I get drained, and I get drained when I have to do sales calls ’cause it’s just outside of my wheelhouse. It’s something I can do. It’s not something that gives me life. So, here are my thoughts for you. I would read a couple of books that are focused on this topic. That’s exactly what I would go for because there are a lot of introverts, and I don’t know what the numbers are, but is it 50% of the world? I mean, it’s certainly some percentage that experience this kind of stuff. And so, there is information out there on it. So, one audiobook that I actually have in our audible library that I believe Sherry bought, I’ve not listened to, but it’s called Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking. And I think as a general book, just to learn more about how you can make introversion a superpower, I think that would be interesting. And the other book that I have not read, but I have had recommended to me, and it’s by Matthew Pollard, it’s called The Introvert’s Edge: How the Quiet and Shy Can Outsell Anyone. And that’s $11 on paperback on Amazon, and it looks like there’s an audio version or whatever. I mean, frankly, go to Amazon and type in sales as an introvert or go to Google and type in sales as an introvert book and just pick one with high reviews. And I think the one that I’ve heard recommended the most is The Introvert’s Edge, but someone is going to have a book’s worth of info about this and a thought process and a framework, and a here’s how you take sales and turn it on its head. If you’re introverted, that’s actually an advantage. So, here’s one thing I do ’cause I’m introverted and so I’m a little anxious about sales. So, I would get on a sales call when I was doing it for Drip, and I would say, “Hey, I’m Rob. I’m the founder. I’m really not a salesperson, but I know that you wanted a demo and I’m here to show you what we can do and try to figure out if we’re a fit for your use case, if we can help you and maybe save you some money ’cause I know you’re on Infusionsoft. Talk to me about your setup today.” Right? And I would kind of get them walking into it, and then I would be evaluating my head, “Are they actually a fit? I only want to sign them up if they’re a fit.” I didn’t want bad customers that are going to churn or are going to be a bad use of our time. And so, I would just be pretty honest with them and be a human upfront about this is who I am and this is the goal, the call rather than trying to talk them into it or trying to act like someone that I wasn’t, right? I didn’t try to channel some fake extrovert in order to do sales, but that’s just my experience. I hope you can find more help in one of the books that I called out. And my last question of the day is from Jake. Jake asks, “Thank you for the amazing content and insights you share on the podcast and the blog. My question, what if your idea is time sensitive and you don’t believe you have the time to do the stair-step approach to learn? I’m working on a site to test the idea and see if it has traction.” Thanks, Jake. I would probably just go validated then. You know what I mean? The stair set method is I don’t have any ideas, and I’m going to go try to do it in a repeatable, predictable fashion that I have a decent confidence that I’m going to build it up over time, and I’m going to have some moderate successes over time that build and build and build. If you have an idea that you really want to build, you’re just very passionate about, then go validate that, right? You can do the 5:00 PM idea validation framework to kind of do a first pass at it, and then do some type of validation. I’ve talked about this. There’s the high-touch validation where you’re actually having conversations whether via email or Zoom or Looms. And then there’s the low touch validation where you build a landing page and you can send traffic to it, either just by talking about it to your audience or running ads or SEO or whatever. There’s a bunch of different ways to do that. So, there’s kind of two, there’s more validation modes than that, but those are the two that I think about. I would certainly not go build this because I didn’t have time to stair-step, but to skip to validation on something that you think there’s a real need for and you believe that you’re excited to build it. There’s no rules in this, right? It’s just recommendations, it’s frameworks, it’s best practices to try to help get you to success faster and more often and more predictably. But none of this is set in stone. It’s all just the insane ramblings of some guy who has been starting companies for 20 years, has a few million-dollar companies under his belt, and has been talking on a microphone for 13 years. Thanks so much for joining me today and for sending in your questions.

In this episode, I’m going to answer listener questions. I have several voicemails and video calls that, as always, go to the top of the stack, and digging into topics like, if someone signs up for my SaaS and I now have their email address, can I make that part of my marketing list? Also, a question about which customer type they should sell to, and what’s the best way to collect customer feedback. Before we dive into that, if you haven’t picked up my book, The SaaS Playbook, after the very successful Kickstarter a few months ago, momentum has continued with the book. And if you haven’t picked it up, you can go to saasplaybook.com, or search for SaaS Playbook in Amazon or Apple iBooks. Is that even what they call it anymore? Audible, all the places. And if you have read it and you like it, I’d really appreciate a five-star rating on Amazon or Audible. That helps me get discovered by new readers. I’ve been very pleased with the reception of the book, so much so that my wife, Dr. Sherry, and I have sat down and written a table of contents for a new book. Glutton for punishment, I believe, is the expression you’re looking for, but we are looking to start writing that here in the next few months, so that would be, at the earliest, an end of ’24 release, most likely maybe spring of ’25. That’s going to continue to be around topics about being a startup founder, diving into the psychology and mental struggles of a certain aspect of being a founder, a certain point in time that many of us aspire to achieve. So more on that later. I want to dive into our first listener question. If you want to send a question to the show, go to startupsfortherestofus.com. Look for Ask a Question in the top nav, and submit your question. Obviously, as I always say, audio and video go to the top of the stack. I will try to get to a couple of text questions in this episode. So let’s hear our first one of the day.  Luke:Good day, Rob and team. I’ve got a small SaaS that is performing humbly, with a few thousand users having created an account and used the product. My question is regarding the email addresses of those people who have created an account. Can I consider that part of my “email list”? So if I were to start working on something new, can I email those people and let them know about it? For the longest time, I thought that I could absolutely do that, but then I saw some chatter about spam, and that my approach could actually be considered spam. If emailing those users isn’t technically allowed, how is an email list actually built, if it’s not from collecting them through various online ventures? Do we need to have a clear checkbox alongside the email input field that states, “I allow you to keep me informed about all the things you’re working on, not just this specific product.”? Look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Luke. There’s the letter of the law, and that of course is literally going to depend on which country you live in, because the laws are different. And then there’s, I’ll say the kind of moral or ethical implications of it. Because letter of the law, if you acquire an email address and someone opts in and checks the box that they can hear from you or that they want to hear from you, I don’t know of anything in CAN-SPAM, which is a US law, and that’s what I’ll refer to the most during this conversation. I don’t know anything in CAN-SPAM that says I can’t email them about anything I’m working on, until they opt out. They need to be able to click on subscribe and opt out, but realistically, could I email them for years and years about different projects that I’m working on? I believe so, not legal advice, but that is my understanding. However, I am of the mind and the belief that I only want to send people things that they have opted in to hear about. And if I’m stretching that definition, for example, let’s say someone opts in at robwalling.com, which they get one of my books for free. It’s called Start Marketing the Day You Start Coding. And in that email, I welcome them and I say, you will hear from me again about stuff that I’m working on. And I hit them up a few weeks later with more info about things I work on on MicroConf and TinySeed. Now, if I go to email those users about a TinySeed batch application opening, I always put, at the top, first paragraph, first several sentences is, usually it’s something like, “You’re receiving this email because you opted in at robwalling.com. And as you know, I work on many things, one of which is TinySeed. It’s my accelerator, blah, blah, blah. If you don’t want to hear from me anymore, click this link right here and you unsubscribe.” Then I go into the email about TinySeed. Similarly, folks opted in at saasplaybook.com, which is my book website. And some folks give their email in order to receive the sample chapter. And that goes into my robwalling.com email list. It’s all one big list in Drip. And so legally, I believe I could just start sending them email about whatever I want because they’ve opted in. But I don’t. If you go to saasplaybook.com, in your email, what you’ll receive from me is the sample chapter. And then a few days later, I believe I send an email, it may be in the first email, I’d have to go and look at exactly what it is, but I basically say, “I work on a lot of things all related to SaaS. If you opted in to hear about this, you’re probably going to be interested in some other stuff I’m doing like Masterminds, like this podcast, this YouTube channel, maybe the accelerator.” And I give people plenty of notice and plenty of options and the ability to unsubscribe. And what I’ve found, I’ve done opt-in and opt-out over the years, where I will not put them on the main list. I’ll only have the list for this single product. And I found that most people were confused by that and said, “Well, I opted in. I wanted to hear about…” We used to do this with MicroConf. This is a great example. We would have a different email list every year for MicroConf. So like the MicroConf 2011 list, we didn’t roll it in to the 2012 event. And we started a new launch list from scratch. We did that for a few years. And then people would tell us, “I’m so confused. I thought I opted in to hear about MicroConf.” So that’s one example of, obviously, we should have just been smarter, but we eventually just started, all right, there is a MicroConf list, and once you opt in, you are going to hear about MicroConf stuff. And we don’t get complaints about that. And in fact, even the way I’m talking about with my book, how I ease people in, if you sign up for a sample chapter, then I merge you into the Rob Walling list. But I call that out, either at the top of an email or in an individual email, saying, “Hey, here’s other stuff that I work on.” For example, “You opted in for a sample chapter of The SaaS Playbook, but here is an entire book called Start Marketing the Day You Start Coding that is free and here’s the link to the PDF.” So to me, the laws are less strict than I think that we should act. We should be looking to be transparent and honest with people who opt into our lists. And so I’ve been in your shoes. You have an example of, I’ve had 2,000 people sign up for this product to get an account in this product over the last several years. So I’ve been in that situation, where I have emailed all those people who had signed up and canceled, and some were still customers, when we launched a big new feature as part of that product. And I couched it with, “You signed up and you canceled, and I’m not going to keep emailing you about this, and unsubscribe here if you want to. But, I felt like you would be interested in this.” And I did this with Drip 2.0. “Drip 2.0 is this whole new thing with automation and blah, blah, blah, and you signed up a year ago. And I think you might be interested in hearing about this.” So that feels like an easy sell to me. I don’t think you’re going to get many complaints. However, if they opted in to try out a product, and while technically, I have the legal right to email them about a new book I’m working on that’s completely unrelated to that product, I don’t think that’s cool. I wouldn’t do that myself. I would want to think, is there enough connection between these two things that I can bridge that with a paragraph or an email? And if I can’t, if it’s really far flung, there is an app for social media posting, that’s the app that they opted into, and then I’m going to go write a book about something completely different, building SaaS companies. In that case, personally, I would ask them if they wanted to opt in, rather than opting in by default and just letting them know, as I’ve said in my previous example. So there’s a little bit of judgment call here and I will say, you said that you felt like you’d be able to email them and then there’s talk online that your approach is spam. I’ll be honest. Look, I ran an ESP for years. There are privacy purists on the internet who say, any bulk email is spam and they’re just (beep) about it. And we would get this complaint all the time and we’d have these people who were either, they were so far off in their perception of how the real world works, that they were just kind of obnoxious (beep). And so if you get online and you’re in Hacker News or you’re on Reddit or you’re on Stack Exchange, especially with developers, and especially with open source developers for some reason, I’m sorry to throw shade, this is the pattern that I kept seeing was, the whole internet should cater to their whim and exactly their opinion. And even though the law says something different, and even though I kind of have my own moral and ethical code around sending email, boy, if it didn’t line up with them, then you’re a (beep) communist or whatever they want to throw at it. It’s like, there is no room for conversation. And so what I’m saying is, be careful with taking people’s perspectives on the internet, especially on public forums, especially on anonymous public forums, about what they consider as spam and what you should and shouldn’t do. In my experience and what I do is I ask myself, if I was on this list, and I opted in for this thing three years ago, and they emailed me, what would I need to read in that email to not feel like I’m pissed off they’re spamming me? What would I need to read? And if I can’t write anything that would make me not think that, then, at best, I’m going to email them and say, “Hey, you signed up for this. I’m working on a new book. I’m not going to email you about it again. Click here to opt in if you’re curious.” That’s the most I’m going to do if these two things are completely unrelated. But if they are related enough that I feel like I can bridge that, then usually, for me, that’s what I do. So thanks for that question, Luke. I’m sure it’s something that other people have encountered as well. And this actually brings up an interesting point of the advantage of building things that are related. Because if you opt in to robwalling.com, and then later on, I email you that I have a new book out, that makes total sense, you would expect to hear that. If I email you about Mastermind Matching with MicroConf, probably still in your wheelhouse. If I email you that Startups for the Rest of Us had a great guest or three great episodes or we’re hitting our 700th episode soon, I’m the host of the podcast, it kind of makes sense. I have this luxury. It’s an intention. It’s not like I lucked into it, but I have a luxury of, most of our lists, if you look at robwalling.com, Startups for the Rest of Us, MicroConf and TinySeed, they’re all closely related enough, that any one of them emailing another list with their announcement can be couched with just a few sentences of why you’re hearing about this. And while we are careful with the volume of email we send, it’s a nice to have if your projects are related enough that you can contact an existing audience that you have, rather than doing what I used to do, where I had nine or 10 products completely unrelated so none of the customer bases could be co-promoted to another of my products. And that was just the way things played out in my early career. But if you’ll notice, as I’ve gotten further along, my software products and my companies have become more and more aligned, because this concept of building kind of a single audience and being able to share audiences between them is pretty powerful. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. And with that, let’s roll our next question about whether to build a service or sell it as an affiliate.  Inad:Hi, Rob. My name is Inad. Thanks a lot for all the content you have been providing over the years. I’ve been trying to follow the advice of, find a solution to an existing problem, focusing on B2B. My challenge though is that I found several ideas based on problems certain people in certain roles are having, but I also found that there are solutions out there they are not using. They are either using a crappy service that has better alternatives out there, or they are not using a service at all and they are just struggling manually. I see this as an opportunity, but I’m not sure how I can take advantage of it. For example, should I build another service, even though that there are alternative services out there, just because they are not using any of these? Should I check for an affiliate program for these existing services and I connect these people to these services? What do you suggest how I can tackle this? Thanks a lot.  Rob Walling:I like this question. It’s pretty creative actually. So I think it depends on your goals. I think that being an affiliate for a SaaS product that offers recurring commissions could be an interesting step one business. Y’all know, drinking game, stair-step method of bootstrapping, step one business, it has platform risk. Usually it’s not going to get you to $10, $20, $30K a month, and that’s how I would view selling someone else’s software as an affiliate. So do I think it could be an interesting step one? I do. Do I think, if you don’t have an audience in this space and you are just doing maybe cold outreach or maybe if you’re creating content around it and actually treating it? Yeah. Think of it like the skeezy review sites where they’re like, we’re going to review the best podcast host, but really, the ones that pay us the highest commission are ranked number one, two, and three. So I personally wouldn’t go down that road. But if you’re going to actually go out and actively try to market other solutions. But I guess if you’re doing cold outreach, it’s going to be kind of a grind. You need to make a lot of money for that to be worth your time, versus if you create more of an inbound funnel where people can click and you can get the commissions, it’s two separate skill sets. But you’re also going to learn a different amount. If you do the cold outreach and you actually are doing demos or consulting, and maybe even charging an onboarding fee to help people get set up to where you really become a freelancer contractor agency that is helping people get onboarded with solutions. And we have these back in the day with Drip where people just came out of the woodwork and said, I offer this service. It’s like the Drip onboarding and setup service. And they would get an affiliate commission and then they would get paid X thousand dollars to get people set up. There were some folks charging like 10 grand to migrate and get your stuff set up on Drip. Is that interesting? I mean, if you’re interested in learning about the space. And what you might learn is that building another tool is a great idea. And what you might learn is that building another tool is a terrible idea. But I think doing that handholding and assuming that the money is there, and at least giving it a shot, I don’t know what you have to lose other than some time. And I think for me, I’d be optimizing for learning, rather than money. Because I think if you’re in it to try to get recurring revenue from an affiliate commission, and for that to be enough to move your needle, I think it’s going to take a long time and a lot of effort if you’re starting from scratch right now, because there are going to already be companies that are ranking for these terms. Unless you see a real through line and a straight line for you to go from zero to an audience, or zero to recurring traffic channels in this space, it’s going to be a ton of work. Again, if you’re optimizing for learning, that’s okay. A ton of work without making a lot of money, at least let’s have learning going on, learning meaning I’m learning about this space, I’m learning maybe we don’t need another tool, or maybe I’m learning that, oh my gosh, if we just had another tool that did X, Y, Z, it would be so much better. These are the things I’d be trying to learn. So I’m not a hard no on this, but I definitely don’t see it as this has such platform risk. You’re not in control of the product. Do I see you wanting to do this for five years? No. But do I see in the short term doing it to make some money to learn about the space, to evaluate whether or not you want to launch a competitor? It’s an interesting idea. It depends on how much work you want to put in and the approach. Like I said, do you want to do a high touch approach and charge a lot of money, almost as a consultant? Or do you want to try to do this low touch approach and just learn the marketing, learn the funnel and see if you can get people to click through and convert? Certainly an interesting question. I appreciate you sending it in. Third question of the day, I’m actually going to bounce over to a text question, because this one has been in the coffers for eight months, it looks like. Apologies, y’all, but I can only do so many of the listener question episodes. But this one, the asker asked to remain anonymous. The subject line is SaaS sale and valuation. And he says, “I’m parting ways with my business partner due to a fallout. In short, I’m looking to get full control of the SaaS, but I’m struggling with evaluating the valuation. Do you happen to help with valuations or investing in SaaS companies? We have a turnover of around $18,000 a month. Please let me know your thoughts.” Given that this was eight months ago, I’m guessed that the asker has sorted it out since then. I wanted to read this on the show and answer it because I have known, I don’t know, a couple of dozen founders who have had to deal with this, who have had a fallout with a co-founder and they’re trying to value the business. And so what I would do is, I would talk to a broker and I would probably pay them for a valuation. So you contact quietlightbrokerage@quietlight.com or FE International, explain the situation and ask for what they think the business would be valued at. Maybe they charge a few hundred dollars or whatever, some number in order to get a third party valuation. You could also ask privately. I have weighed in privately on some valuations based on my experience. You have to take all this with a grain of salt. It’s not like buying and selling stocks. It’s an inefficient market and there’s a lot of it depends, and that’s what you’ll hear. It depends on the growth rate. Like having a static $18K per month. Well, if it’s growing a hundred percent year over year, the valuation’s different than if it’s 30% or less. What’s your churn like? What’s the space like? There’s all this stuff where it’s kind of like, well, it changes the multiple. The generic multiples that we throw out really depend on a lot of this stuff. But I have been involved in multiple companies, some of which I was invested in, where one co-founder leaves and the other one buys them out. And usually, the buyout is a little less. It’s usually less than market rate for that app, if you’re buying them out in cash. Because it just should be. Because you are left with the business and you now have to slash get to run it. But realistically, I think the easiest, the cleanest way is you’re going to be brokers in our space. So it’s Quiet Light Nefi for this type of business. I think as you get larger, let’s say you get north of a million ARR, you could still talk to Quiet Light Nefi, but Discretion Capital, run by my friend and co-founder, Einar Vollset, would be great to reach out to for them to weigh in. And if you’re big enough, what’s interesting is, let’s say you’re doing two or $3 million a year and you’re growing pretty quick. And you decide the valuation is $12 million bucks or something. And you want to buy your co-founder out and they own 50%. Well, that’s a lot of cash to come up with. There are outside parties, and Einar has experience with this through TinySeed and Discretion, with these private equity firms that are growth-oriented and they’re willing to write a bigger check to buy out founders. And they can buy out the founders if they’re staying. They can buy out a founder if they are moving on. And they’re willing to come in and some of them even have a playbook of how to take a SaaS from that $2 million to $10 million ARR mark. So this is something that I’d never heard of and really just didn’t exist 10 years ago. And so it is another option for liquidity for a situation like you are talking about in this email. But as I said, that would only be available if you were further along. It is not going to be at $18K per month there. I don’t know of anyone that’s willing to do partial buyouts at that early a stage. If there are any, there’s probably one or two and they’re probably extreme value buyers, meaning they’re going to give you very low multiples. And then of course, your other option is to sell the whole company. It’s to go to any of the brokers I just mentioned. And add acquire.com to that and just try to cash out the business. You each walk away and then you get to start your next one. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. The next question is about the best way to collect customer feedback.  Speaker 4:Hey, Rob. How are you doing? I want to say that I’ve been fan of the show, had been listening these whole year, in the beginning of the year when I discover it. And a bit about me and I aspiring founder. I still on the process of validating a few ideas that I have. But this question is a bit related to customer feedback. You had mentioned extensively in a lot of your podcasts, in your book, which I have by the way, The Saas Playbook, and many other people also have mentioned that customer feedback, acquiring customer feedback, is super important. So my question is, what will you recommend for acquiring this customer feedback? Which mechanisms, forms, emails, phone calls or video calls? Anyway, I appreciate all you are doing and keep it on. Bye.  Rob Walling:It’s a great question. It’s a common question. So to me, in the early days, if you’re doing one Z two Z, then the higher the fidelity, the better. If you can get a customer on a Zoom call or a phone call, that is going to be greater than anything else. Because again, it’s just high fidelity. You can read body language. You can have, even if it’s a 20 or 30 minute conversation, there’s so much information that is communicated in that that won’t be communicated if you have a form or an email. So that’s optimum if you can get people on calls. Sometimes, people don’t want to go on calls. I will be asked for feedback about a tool I’m using and I don’t have time to do that. So I might write three sentences in an email. Or I might record a Loom. So Loom is interesting because it’s kind of halfway between maybe a text email and a video call. You don’t have the back and forth interaction that I would like, but you do get the high fidelity of voice intonation and body language and hearing someone’s real interactions or seeing their real interactions with your product. To give you an example, with MicroConf, we just added paid tiers to MicroConf Connect and that is our online community, 5,700 bootstrap founders. You should check it out, microconfconnect.com. But producer Xander did dozens and dozens of one-on-one calls to learn more about what people are looking for from Connect. And once they get in to learn what they’re liking, and perhaps where their expectations didn’t align with what we’ve delivered. So he did a ton of calls. At one point, so in the early days of Drip, before we launched, I had 3,400 people on an email list. And so I think I did a couple of phone calls, but most of my early, early stuff with about the first 20 people was via email and that’s what they preferred, and frankly what I preferred too. But I was also trying to get data from the broader list and 3,400 people’s a lot. And so I did use a survey. I actually covered it… What episode was it? Boy, it’s got to be in the 200s, maybe the 300s. I realize it’s not a bunch of guidance. If you go back and look for an episode, it would’ve been in 2013. And it’s going to be me talking about kind of a customer development survey. It’s a really good episode. It’s one of my favorite episodes from around that time, where I walked deep into exactly the survey I sent out to the entire list. And then I will walk through some of the results. And I still have those results actually in a Google Sheet. I was looking through them the other day and I was like, man, it was very helpful for me to learn that. But if you don’t have 3,400 people on the list, don’t send people to a form. No one wants to fill out a survey. They’re not going to type a bunch. They think no one reads it. Like having the one-on-one connection, that’s the highest fidelity learning that you will get. So I would lean much more towards phone calls or video calls, and at worst, one-on-one emails, assuming that people will respond to you. Because oftentimes, the hard part is not the mechanism of feedback, it’s that people just won’t respond. And they don’t want to spend the time out of their day to help you out. And getting on a Zoom call is cumbersome for a lot of people who are busy. And so that’s the thing is, I lean towards higher fidelity if it’s possible, and that’s the caveat. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. My last question of the day comes from longtime listener, David.  David:Hey, Rob. This is David, longtime listener and appreciate all you do for the startup community. My first startup was acquired a couple of years back, completely bootstrapped. My co-founder worked a full-time job up until the day we were acquired. It was great. And now, after about two years, I guess, I’m looking for my next startup, and I’m focusing on the HOA space. Homeowners associations are a big market. I’m on my board right now and there are tons of challenges. One of the challenges is figuring out whether we sell to the property management companies, which seems a little bit more of a saturated market than the HOA boards themselves, which could be really hard to contact. So we have an MVP, at least a concept, we haven’t built it yet, and I’m thinking about just trying to start selling to boards and property managers, just to see if it resonates, before creating a landing page. But just asking for any advice you have on how do we figure out whether we can actually distribute and sell to HOA boards or whether we’ll have to go the property management route. Thanks.  Rob Walling:So to truly answer this question in detail and tell you exactly what you should do, I would personally need some experience or have funded companies who have tried to sell to HOA versus property managers. And I do not have that experience, and I have not funded companies that are selling to those. So all I can do is weigh in on how I would think about it if I were in your shoes, knowing what I know. And the two things that come to mind are, number one, I would try to figure out, is it harder for HOA boards to make a decision to buy than it is property managers? My gut is that it is, because it’s a board of people. And anytime there’s a group of people, they’re going to kick decisions down the line. There’s going to be 4, 5, 6 chefs in the kitchen, so to speak. My gut tells me they’re going to be a pain in the to sell to. So I would lean towards property managers where I’m guessing that I could find one decision maker and close more deals. That may or may not be true. I don’t know enough about the space, but that’s probably the hypothesis that I would look to validate or invalidate if I were in your shoes. The second thing that I would think about is running a test and actually marketing and trying to sell to both. I know that it would require a bit more work because I’m doing, let’s say, cold outreach. Well, now I need two campaigns because I’m reaching out to the HOA boards and the property managers. Or if I’m doing inbound marketing, I obviously need probably different content marketing or SEO posts or whatever it is I’m doing to attract that inbound. I know that it means more work. But until I know for sure, I want to keep asking questions and trying to validate this. That’s really the way that I’m thinking about this. And the way I think about everything is everything’s a hypothesis until I’ve mostly proven or disproven it. Now, am I ever going to get to a hundred percent certainty that it’s only HOA boards or property managers? You’re not going to get there. You’re not going to get to a hundred percent. And I’m sure you know this, having listened to this podcast. But some founders come to me and say, “I’ve just done all this conversation. I still don’t know what to do.” And it’s like, you’re never going to know what to do. You just have to take your gut and add it to the information you have and make the best choice. And even if you get to 50, 60, 70% validation that your hypothesis is correct or is incorrect, that’s better than you had a month ago or two months ago. And so that’s what I would try to think about is, what’s the next step that I could take to figure out, are HOA boards hard to sell to versus property managers? Does this involve going to an in-person event for property managers? Because we know those exist, right? Are there in-person events for HOA boards? I think HOA boards, aren’t they mostly volunteers? Question mark? You can tell, my familiarity with the space isn’t there, but my familiarity with making decisions like this is there. And the first thing I would do is, how do I collect more data? And so maybe it is cold outreach to HOA boards to see if anyone will respond. If they’re not looking for it, and you reach out with a question around, “Hey, you have this problem, does it need to be solved? I’m a local entrepreneur trying to solve this problem. Is this even a big problem? Just starting. I’m not here to sell you anything. I’m just curious if this problem is enough of a pain point that…?” And if you reach out to HOA boards and property managers, and one of those groups just completely doesn’t get back to you, then how are you going to find customers when you actually have a product? I’ve said that on the show before. It’s like, response to outreach and response to marketing, before you have a product, can be a pretty good signal of how hard the space is going to be to sell into. And realistically, let’s say you get in touch with a bunch of HOA boards and property managers and no one responds, so where are you then? Well, then I’m thinking, okay, so cold outbound at least isn’t working. So then, do I need to do inbound? And which of these is most likely to be looking for this solution? And if there’s no inbound opportunity, how are you going to market it once you’ve spent the six months to build a product? That’d be at the top of my mind is, are there any Google AdWords? You can run Google AdWords and just lose money right now, because what you’re trying to do is learn. And if HOA boards versus property managers search for this software, and if they search for it the same or different, I don’t care. Even if I’m paying 10 bucks a click, if I have the budget just to get into conversations by buying ads, this may be AdWords, maybe it’s Facebook, maybe it’s Instagram, where do property managers and HOA boards hang out? I don’t actually know. Facebook groups? If you’re in my hobbies, I know where the people hang out. But I don’t know it for this specific industry. And so in your shoes, that’s what I’d be trying to do is find out where they hang out online. Find out where they look for solutions. My guess is, there is some in-person component to this, and it’s a lot of word of mouth. And whether there’s an industry… Again, is it industry event or trade pub? Or is there a Slack group or an industry Facebook group where they hang out? That’s usually something that forms around these organizations. I would personally want to familiarize myself enough with this that I can make a decent gut instinct to call on. I think these are going to be easier to sell to rather than the others. And with all that said, there’s a chance that going after both is the right call, that literally going after two verticals at the start, it’s not a hard pass for me. Just because we talk about niching down or focusing our product doesn’t mean that we can’t have a couple of highly related verticals, especially if both of them onboard and use the product in the same way, even if the sales process is slightly different. I don’t know. It’s something I would consider in your shoes. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. Thanks for joining me again this week.

What should I do for that episode? If you have an idea of something I should do special for 700, questions at startupsfortherestofus.com and let me know. I may or may not do anything special. If you look back at 600, it was me talking about some Beatles songs, Strawberry Fields Forever, and I didn’t even mention it was 600 until the last 30 seconds of the episode. So we’ve done something special for most of the 100 anniversaries. I think 1, 2, 3, 4, and 500 we’re always special episodes. 600 was less so. At a certain point, I think you kind of run out of ideas of new and creative things to do at the 00 episode mark. But certainly, if you have an idea, shoot it over to me. And with that, I’m really signing off from episode 690.","PublishedAt":"December 5, 2023","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-690-when-opt-in-email-could-be-spam-collecting-customer-feedback-and-more-listener-questions"},{"Title":"Episode 689 | How to Keep Your Remote Team Motivated and Engaged","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 689 | How to Keep Your Remote Team Motivated and Engaged\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t30:12\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 30:12 | Recorded on November 19, 2023\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 689, Rob Walling interviews Robert Cserti, co-founder of SessionLab.

I’m Rob Walling, and today I sit down with Robert Cserti and we’d talk about how to keep your remote team motivated and engaged. This topic is based on a request that I received at MicroConf Europe, and Robert as the founder of SessionLab and a team of 13 has quite a bit of experience on this topic. He’s a founder, not a business coach or a consultant on how to keep your remote team motivated and engaged, but they have experimented a lot over the years with strategies and approaches for doing so. And I think it turned out to be a great conversation. If you’ve ever thought about selling your SaaS company or your WordPress plugin or even a content website, head to microconf.com/sell. We have some great resources for you there, such as The Psychology of Exiting Your Company which was a talk by our very own Dr. Sherry Walling, as well as a way to opt to hear about our Exit Event, which is an exclusive MicroConf retreat we’re thinking about running next year, plus links to episodes of Startups For the Rest of Us. And all of this is brought to you by our brokerage partner for 2023. It’s Quiet Light Brokerage. They’re an entrepreneur-led organization that assists people with growing, buying, and selling online businesses. I have a very high opinion of Quiet Light and how they operate their business. Their reputation is stellar in our space. Thank you to Quiet Light for supporting MicroConf and this podcast. And I hope you’ll check out microconf.com/sell as well as quietlight.com if you’re interested in learning more about buying, selling, and growing your online business. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation about keeping your remote team motivated and engaged. Robert, thanks so much for joining me.  Robert Cserti:Thank you. Excited to be here.  Rob Walling:Indeed, sir. So you are the co-founder of SessionLab. You are a TinySeed EMEA company, and the H1 of SessionLab is an easier way to design workshops, drag, drop, and reuse content, calculate time automatically, collaborate in real time. Create a workshop in minutes, not hours, with SessionLab. Can you give folks an idea, first of all, of the stage that SessionLab is at, whether it’s revenue or employee headcount?  Robert Cserti:We are 13 people growing profitably. And about SessionLab itself, we help facilitators, consultants, team leaders to design and deliver effective workshops. Typical use case, you would use our workshop agenda planner tool if you have a full-day strategy workshop or a two-day leadership retreat. Somebody plans these processes, what people do at what time of the day, and that’s the facilitator. And these are typically facilitators, agile coaches, org dev professionals, learning and development people. So we help them design better workshops. And next to that is also we have the biggest online library of workshop activities. So if you look for icebreakers, energizers, brainstorming techniques at the sessionlab.com/library and you can get inspiration for your next meeting or workshop.  Rob Walling:And in case folks are curious, where are you located in Europe?  Robert Cserti:We are a fully remote team. Our company’s officially Estonian. I live in Hungary. My co-founder’s in Sweden. We are Estonian e-residents and our company’s 10 different countries. That’s for our team members. Practically, we are remote since day zero. We happen to be in different countries and that’s how we started to grow the company.  Rob Walling:Well, that’s bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped playbook almost, right?  Robert Cserti:Oh, yeah.  Rob Walling:That’s what we do. We don’t have the money to hire in these major cities and so we look around for the best people we can find. I want to set the stage for this episode. I actually was approached at MicroConf Europe in Lisbon just a month or two ago. And I didn’t get his permission to use his name so I won’t use his name. I’ll keep him anonymous, but he said, “You know what? I’d love to hear an episode about team engagement, specifically remote team engagement. How do you keep your employees, contractors, whoever you consider to be on your team, motivated, engaged?” Even just knowing one another, the more you know the other people on your team, the less likely there are to be, I don’t know, maybe conflicts. Or it’s easier to work together. I actually posted in the TinySeed Slack and I said, “I’m going to record an episode around this. Who has some thoughts on this?” And I got a bunch of really good responses, probably a dozen responses, from very knowledgeable founders, all running teams remotely. I think the first thing I was struck by was how many founders, including you, said, “I’m not an expert but here’s what we do.” So that’s the thing, you run this team. And how long has SessionLab been around?  Robert Cserti:Practically, we started the company 10 years ago. First five years was a hobby or side project. Then we realized, “Oh, we have customers. This is a business. Let’s build it.” Then we went full-time. A year later, we started hiring people as our revenue grew. So essentially, there’s two big distinct stages. And the interesting thing with remote engagement is it was definitely a process for us to realize that, well, building a team is a job itself and getting people engaged. Because initially as founders, we are into product and figuring out marketing and sales, and then realize, “Oh, we have now people on the team. It’s not only myself or two of us.” So we need to figure out what is our culture and how to keep people engaged. And that’s a very organic thing and it’s not the first thing that came to my mind. We also had our stage like, “Oh, we actually need to put more attention to how we engage people and what’s our culture.”  Rob Walling:Right. I think a lot of us who worked at other companies… I worked at a startup that was probably 40 people when it started or when I started there, and then it was several hundred by the time I left. And the company culture stuff always felt like just bull (beep) to me. It was like, “Let’s just come here and do the work.” But what I realized later as I started running teams as well, if you don’t introduce a culture, then the culture will happen on its own and you won’t be in control of it. And so that’s where mission, vision, values, I always thumbed my nose at them, these 50% companies. But a lot of that was because I didn’t feel like they were accurate or true versus my mission now. And I think MicroConf’s and TinySeed mission is to multiply the number of independent self-sustaining startups in the world. That’s a real mission and you see it, we’re actually doing that, most missions and values.  Robert Cserti:And you’re walking the talk, and that’s a big difference between a small and large company that you as the founder in a small team, you have an integral part in setting the culture.  Rob Walling:Right. We’re going to dive into your response along with some other points that were brought up by other folks. As I said, there were 12 different responses, but yours was good. It was long. It was detailed. It was thorough. And then your co-founder Filip even weighed in, and we’ll look at one of the points he raised. But in addition, there are some other TinySeed folks who weighed in, and certainly want to thank everybody who offered some points. Again, couching it with you’re not a company culture, neither am I, a company culture expert nor a consultant, but this is what’s working for you. And I’ve run remote teams. I would have to even count. It’s got to be four or five range. TinySeed is six people and MicroConf is five or six depending on how you count. And Drip was 10, half remote when we were running it. Anyway, I’ve just had a bunch of experience as well and I’ve seen what has worked and what has not. So let’s start with daily check-ins, and this is something that you mentioned that you do. You async daily check-ins specifically. A lot of people I know do not. We don’t do daily check-ins at TinySeed or MicroConf. We do have a weekly meeting where we get together and talk about stuff and then everyone, the introverted in our midst go separate ways and get work done. But specifically you said there are a bunch of tools for async daily check-ins. You are using Geekbot and usually when you start your day, if you’re working, it’s at SessionLab, you answer four questions, a combination of social and work-related. “How do you feel today? What did you do since yesterday? What will you do today? And what obstacles are impeding your process?” Talk me through this. Is this working? Did you try other things and weekly wasn’t enough? Why do a daily async check-in?  Robert Cserti:Yeah, absolutely. First of all, it’s a very iterative process to come up with what works for you and your team. We had different processes in place at a size of 3, 4, 5 people, and now at 13, and probably will have different as we grow. I think just to take a step back, one thing I would structure the thinking on various tools and processes, I see two big purpose. And we can break down to further subpurposes, but two big areas, both want to help with efficiency. So enable people to get their work done efficiently because everybody likes to do great work and be enabled to do that. And in the same time, also help people to feel valued, to feel appreciated, and to feel belonging. And most of the tools and structures are either for one or the other or a mix of both. For this part, the keeping aligned, we actually do weekly alignment calls as well. So every Monday, we have three bigger teams in the company, product, marketing, and customer success. We have a 30 to 45 minutes sync call where we align on the weekly priorities. And if there’s any questions, then we discuss those more in detail. And then these check-ins, then it’s a mix of keeping that alignment and also a social part, because essentially it feels good when we know that people are around. They are present. They’re available. And also it’s how we shape these things. I think important that, again, you’ve walked the talk, what you expect when you communicate with your colleagues. A fun thing that emerged over the years, we have people joining and they say, “When I was working in-person, I never knew that much about my colleagues.” And that’s because we share a lot of personal things in this first question, “How do we feel?” They don’t just say, “Yeah, I’m okay.” But what did I do yesterday, what I did the weekend with friends, with my kids, whatever. And it’s really up to the individual how much effort you put into it. But once you start opening up, you share more personal thing, you show some vulnerability, people get that and then they also join in that. So then it’s like a good, I think, water cooler. And just like when you enter a real office, people say hi to each other and they may have some short chat. Here as well. You can engage with it if you want a given day, or you can just not if you have other things to do on that day when you start. So that just evolved both with a social purpose of having this water cooler, and next to that, essentially helping each other know that what am I focusing on a given day. There was times when it just these slightly different question, it didn’t work as much. And then every once in a while, we reflect. Does this still work? Is this still giving value? If not, we tweak on it. If it’s good, then we keep doing it.  Rob Walling:And in addition to a daily check-in, it’s very common to have weekly, monthly. And there’s one-on-ones and there’s groups. And you specifically called out a few of these. You said these regular practices that some other folks mentioned were, I believe, do you have a week starting team alignment call?  Robert Cserti:Yep.  Rob Walling:45 to 60 minutes?  Robert Cserti:Yeah. Practically, with each Monday we have a team call with a subteam. So in our case, product, marketing, customer success where we align on the priorities, see where we are with our quarterly objectives projects, and that gives a focus for the team. And these daily check-ins are more like just what do I do on a given day, breaking it further down.  Rob Walling:The weekly get-on-the-same-page meetings, is that the entire company or is it team-based? So if there’s product and dev, that’s one. And then customer success and support maybe is another.  Robert Cserti:In our case, we now do it, team-based. But again as we evolved, I think when we were size of five, six, we had it together and then we broke it up. Then product was a bit bigger team and then customer success and marketing did together. It’s really like what type of projects and goals we have in a given quarter and just making sure that these alignments support achieving what you want to do in a given quarter.  Rob Walling:Got it. And then I believe, do you also have a biweekly all-hands that’s 45 minutes?  Robert Cserti:Yes. We just change it actually from weekly to biweekly because it’s a lot of meetings, and in product-  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s the problem.  Robert Cserti:In a way, there is some meetings have a cost and so does working on a dead end path has cost. So there is a fine line between the two. And it really depends on your team as well, how much experienced people you have, what type of things you work on. We are trying to use for example the all-hands more for the purpose of some more inspiring presentations or things that everybody is useful to know about. Let’s say if you work on customer personas or have a big design project, that affects everybody. Those are good to be presented, while it’s less for aligning in terms of a practical operational way.  Rob Walling:Got it. And those are still work-focused, not a monthly hangout that I heard several folks talking about?  Robert Cserti:Yes, that’s right. So yeah, the all-hands are more for keeping us on the same page, what’s happening on a big picture or more on a strategy level. We also want to make sure that on the side of let’s have some more team bonding and team connection, we have every month, month and a half, some online team event, an hour of ideally something facilitated activity where we get to have some fun. I would say if we would work in-person in one city, we’ll probably go out in an evening or do some activity together. We don’t have that so we want to make space. On the grander picture, what really helps us is to have also team retreat. We try to have it twice a year. All of us get together for a week, and we use it both for a work purpose to workshop on a project that really benefit from that focused attention that you can have in live, and also have some leisure day when we have some organized activities and all the leisure time, all the unstructured time we have together. But in our case, there is half a year between them. So we want to make sure that next day, the everyday work, there is some activities where we both celebrate successes and also have some moments to build connections and build bonds, and again, just have opportunities where we can bring a bit more ourselves.  Rob Walling:Yeah. It’s a luxury that we have at MicroConf, TinySeed that we have so many in-person events that we don’t have to structure or we haven’t traditionally structured external team retreats where we just go to a place. Because we meet up at MicroConf, we meet up at TinySeed retreats.  Robert Cserti:Yeah, that’s an amazing opportunity.  Rob Walling:It’s really nice, and it’s an opportunity that SaaS companies don’t have because you’re located remotely and there’s just no reason for you all to be in a room. But the value of getting into a room, I know as companies get bigger, I believe Zapier went down to a once a year company retreat because it’s a quarter million dollars or something to throw their company retreat because it’s so many people. But it’s like I think three times a year would be ideal to get people together.  Robert Cserti:And it’s amazing how much those intense in-person meetings fuel collaboration. There’s a concept of a trust battery that you build with small human interaction and when you spend time together. And when that battery is high, then collaboration is happening at a higher quality during online work. So we definitely see after retreat, we communicate more, we shift things faster, we solve these agreements faster. It makes a difference. And then we need to also get by between two retreats to build up these trust batteries practically or maintain them to a high enough level that it doesn’t deeply do much before reach next one.  Rob Walling:Right, for sure. And so we were talking about an all-hands that you do every other week that is still focused on work stuff. Do you also, much like several of the folks who weighed in on the TinySeed thread, do you also do a monthly hangout where it’s still remote and it’s the team getting together just for happy hour-ish and more personal conversation?  Robert Cserti:Yeah. I would say that that’s more the team bonding focused events where we don’t have work agenda but it’s really to have an hour of time spent together ideally doing something which has some themes, some activity. One of our favorite activity that has been a big success whenever we played is an online board game called Cozy Juicy Real, which is again an activity which is somewhat facilitated and you open up about certain aspects of your life and you give appreciation to each other, you express gratitude to each other, and that just makes feel everybody happy. In the end, I think all these retreats and team activities definitely does have a cost in time and money, but people want to be part of a workplace where they are valued. If I reflect in my previous work experiences as well, whenever I feel that my bosses value me, I really put my best there because I don’t want to let people down who care about me. And that feels good to be at a place where you’re valued.  Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

These are from other folks who weighed in. One person said, “We have one monthly call with the entire team. We do a round of personal and work-related updates followed by a round of talking about a fun fact or playing a game on the call.” So it’s similar. It’s a good way to get to know everyone and learn a thing or two about them that usually doesn’t come up in normal work-related conversations. And then another founder weighed in. “We started doing a monthly happy hour for a social gathering of the entire team. We do social activities like trivia games, Guess the Desk,” I’m not sure what that is, “et cetera. People seem to love it.” So this does seem to be a relatively common theme with remote teams.  Robert Cserti:Absolutely. And I think it’s like you don’t have that intense human interaction as you would have in-person, so you need to make space for various ways for people to interact, both in a group setting, also if you can in a one-on-one setting. One of the useful things that we have seen that we are trying recently is people working in same teams, they interact often. But people who don’t work in the same teams don’t talk as much or don’t interact as often. And we introduce, for example, one activity where we have randomly assigned one-on-ones. So not for work purpose but just take half an hour from working time and just have a chat. And we use a Slack app called Donut for this, which essentially takes the scheduling or the randomization, which is also a nice small thing that it makes sure that between two retreats or between two such intense occasions, you actually get to speak with everybody on the team if you want. By the way, most of these things are also optional. The online team events, the extra one-on-one chats. So if people want, they can. They’re not forced to participate. But most people love it because it just builds human connections.  Rob Walling:I’ll be honest. You all do more than I typically do with my remote teams. And when I hear you describing the meetings, it feels to me like, “Wow, that’s a lot of meetings.” But maybe it isn’t that way. Maybe it doesn’t feel that way in your company. How do you think about that? At what point is it too many? And does the value decrease? Because each of these things you introduce can increase connection, but I think at a certain point, people will also glaze over at another Zoom meeting.  Robert Cserti:Yeah, that’s a good question. I think everybody need to evaluate it for themselves. What is the point where you feel it’s too much? In our case, that’s an average weekly two meetings for alignment and team purpose. Is that much or not\u003e we feel when we have less, that we either have a gap in the team bonding side or we have a gap in the alignment side. And essentially, one of these is more for alignment, one of these is more for the team spirit. And very importantly if you have a team, I think one thing that we initially thought this all on us as founders to figure out, but people who are in our team, they have experiences themselves as well, what worked well in their previous jobs and not. So we try to reflect together what works well and what not. And there is a process. For example, we recently figured out that it’s not worth it to have every week in all-hands so we do it biweekly. And if it doesn’t give value biweekly, then we do it monthly.  Rob Walling:Right. So if you find you’re in too many meetings, you space it out further, as you said. You went from weekly to every other week to monthly. And I want to touch on two other points in this interview. Two things that you specifically called out that this first one I found interesting you put in the Slack thread. “Another interesting addition in the past half year in our workflow was part of our team using a sort of spatial video conferencing tool to hang out there during the day. The concept is it’s easy to move your avatar away. But if you want, then it’s very quick to start communication with other people just by moving next to them.” And you’re using spatial.chat for this.  Robert Cserti:Yeah, that was a fun experiment which is more in the work efficiency category, in that initial categorization that we realized that we had a couple of more context projects where it was important that we can align quickly when we have a problem. We had a major infrastructure change and we had series of bigger questions where it was just important that the key developers could interact quickly. And then it’s definitely not a tool we use company-wide, but there is opportunity for people who find it useful to do it. Essentially, you need to still have a chance to work focused and it gives that, but if you quickly need to regroup to discuss something, then you do that. And for our case, our dev team enjoys it so they going back there on a regular basis. And I think most days, one or two hours. It’s important to have the discipline though because you just don’t want to hang out because it’s definitely a need to have focused time to do deep work. But if you find what is the intersection then, and especially if you have a need for that, if you have a project where… Because sometimes work is simple and you have well-scoped projects to work on that everybody can take on individually and execute. Sometimes there is way more complexity and you need two people to be able to jam quickly on something. And when we recognize that case, then this is useful.  Rob Walling:One other tool you mentioned that I thought was pretty clever is you said, “It’s not so remote-specific, but one management tool I find really useful is sending a monthly reflection survey at the end of each month. It asks about accomplishments and challenges of the past month, asks how I can help, and asks for a rating on how happy, satisfied, they are and why.” And the results go directly to you the founder, not to the person’s manager. So talk us through the thought process of that and what information perhaps you’re learning that you wouldn’t if you didn’t have those.  Robert Cserti:This is a bit of a heat check on the team to get an impression of how everybody is doing individually. And first and foremost, which is even more important, that everybody has a mentor manager who takes care of one’s personal development and that one progresses. But this is more when we reached a stage that I was not anymore in a regular connection with each team member, then it was just a really practical way to… First the reflection part, that each month you actually have a moment when you look back, “This is what I achieved this month, and also what are my challenges?” And if everything is perfect, an ideal word, then this has no new information because the manager of the person already took care of that. But there’s always a couple of people who, for various reasons have various difficulties, more challenges, and they just essentially one outlet where you can voice that, “Well, I’m not that frustrated to proactively seek out support, but if I ask and I build the trust that whenever you say something that you need help, then I follow up.” Then people give that trust and they indicate, “Well, something is just not going the right direction,” and then they can help faster. So it helps to catch issues earlier on. And also it’s definitely have the element of not to go around once managerial line. It’s a complex word for a small company, but still give one more space to say if you feel that things are not in the right direction. And also what I found really useful is this essentially quantitative feedback of rate how you feel on a scale of 1 to 10 in the company, and it really is a quick feedback tool. If you give us lower than a certain rating, I know that I need to really follow up and pay attention. And not just me, but then we discussed with the manager there, “So what can we help? How can we support you? Whether you had a more difficult personal life in the past weeks or it’s work-related, what can we do to help?” So it just helps to catch these things.  Rob Walling:Well, thanks for talking us through all the tools that you’re using to grow SessionLab. I think before we wrap up, I wanted to offer one more comment that a TinySeed founder who I didn’t get their permission to mention him in the show so I’ll just keep them anonymous for now, but something they said that I think you and I probably both agree with but I’m curious to hear your take on it. They said, “I feel async remote requires different strategies versus purely remote where you can be synchronous.” This founder says, “We have very small overlaps of working day with the majority of our team, so we have to spend a lot of time on developing processes to ensure everyone is on the same page and working on the right goals. As much as we would love to do a big all-hands weekly catch-up to build team culture, it’s impossible for us to find a time that works for everyone. So we have to rely on Slack and ClickUp communication most of the time with varying levels of success.” So async remote different than remote, do you have experience with this? Do you have thoughts on it?  Robert Cserti:Well, only partially because we are in a lucky situation. We are roughly plus/minus one, two hours, same time zone. So we have the luxury to be able to meet each other. And I think it’s a sliding scale between almost having a full overlap versus having zero overlap. That’s a spectrum. In the end, I think the processes are very similar. It forces you to document effectively, to have the right processes. But also I think that’s a hard thing to start from. And I would definitely in this case make sure that it’s great to work with people remote if those people are experienced in remote and experienced in their specific job as well. So if I would not have overlapped with somebody who I worked together with, then I would be very cautious to handle somebody who just starts out. And one way is to just try to find people who are experienced both with remote work and with their specific field because that decreases the need of how close you need to communicate. And other than that, just take efficiency to a higher level. Yet you still, you need to build those async processes as well to have people feel valued and appreciated and part of that team if you want to build it for the long run. It’s easy to say and hard to do.  Rob Walling:I agree. I feel like in a perfect world, I would be in an office with my team maybe two days a week, two and a half days a week. That’s what we had when we were building Drip with most of the team, and it allowed us to collaborate, stand in front of our whiteboard, hang out, go to lunch. And then the other days we were at home and I was focused on getting work done. That was my ideal situation. That’s just not feasible really for the types of companies most of us are building. And the next hard, I’d say harder way to do it, it’s not hard mode per se but it is more difficult is to have a remote team and to have to try to get people together and get everyone to like each other and get people on the same page and build a culture. Then the next hard mode is async remote. It’s so hard when everything has to be a Slack response or a video recording or an audio recording or whatever it is. It really is a next-level challenge. And I would guess that most companies, whether bootstrapped or not, most companies around the world will have significant challenges doing async remote.  Robert Cserti:Yeah, that’s so true. It’s such a great opportunity if you can start at least with a team that is in roughly your time zones. That makes interaction easier. And also it just makes it easier to meet in live once a while because that’s a strong starting point. Also, to help defining your culture and align with those people.  Rob Walling:Right. And I know that’s what we’re talking about is just not feasible in every part of the world. You and I have this luxury of living in the US and in Europe and there’s a lot of talent within, as you said, plus or minus two, three hours of us. And some parts of the world, that’s just not the case. And so you certainly have your work cut out for you in that situation. Robert, thanks so much for joining me today. Folks want to keep up with what you’re building, sessionlab.com. And is there any social media that folks should follow?  Robert Cserti:Yeah on LinkedIn, Robert, C-S-E-R-T-I. Happy to connect there. And thanks so much, Rob. Pleasure to be here.  Rob Walling:Thanks for coming.

I’m Rob Walling, and this week I talk with Lane Wagner of Boot.dev about how he’s mostly bootstrapped his coding learning platform to the most recent month’s net revenue of 110,000. We cover a bit of his journey, getting it started, how he was able to bootstrap it, why he raised funding, whether or not that wound up being a good idea, as well as diving into what got his growth to dramatically accelerate, where he was growing, not very fast, and then suddenly things ticked up into the right. I asked him about that. Before we dive into that, tickets for MicroConf US in Atlanta next April 2024 are on sale. This event will sell out.

With that, let’s dive into my conversation with Lane. Lane Wagner, welcome to the show.  Lane Wagner:Hey. Thanks for having me on, Rob.  Rob Walling:I’m excited to dig in to Boot.dev today. Your H1 is learn backend development the smart way. Welcome to the most captivating, finger-flying, addictive way to learn to code. That’s good marketing copy. Did you write that?  Lane Wagner:Thanks. I wrote a very similar version and then I have a marketing consultant that also helps tweak it.  Rob Walling:Nice. That helps. So, to give folks an idea of where you’re at today in terms of the business, you have graciously published your revenue numbers on Indie Hackers. We can link that up in the show notes, but you had some pretty incredible growth recently. Even as of four months ago, five months ago, you were at 24K MRR. No, 24K net revenue, in gross revenue in the month. This previous month, which was October of ’23, you were at $110,000. That’s a heck of a growth rate. What has gone on over there? We’ll get into your whole origin story, but what has happened to 4X in four months?  Lane Wagner:It’s been absolutely crazy. I was on the Indie Hackers podcast. It was actually back-to-back with your episode, I think. This is before they stopped doing the podcast, or at least took a pause from it. Yeah, that was when we were about 26K, and the last three months have all been over 80 or 90. We’ve pulled a few growth levers that seem to have actually had some good returns on them, and we can get into that, but it’s primarily YouTube. YouTube has been good to us.  Rob Walling:I do want to dip into it a little bit because I’ve been doing so much on YouTube myself with MicroConf. We’ve tried, probably three different … I’ve tried so many approaches on YouTube, where it’s like, “Well, I already record this podcast and video. Can’t we just put it on YouTube?” It’s like, “You can, and no one will watch it. You’ll get tens of views per day.” It’s totally meaningless. Then we tried doing clips because we have, sometimes fun clips, or we do Q\u0026A, listener questions where we can have a question and an answer, and that’s going to be the topic of the video, and we publish those. Crickets, for the most part. I mean, basically our audience would watch it, and it was not growing the audience. Then we tried another thing and eventually we figured something out, and I won’t go too deep into it, but we basically went from 10,000 subscribers to almost 70,000 subscribers in about 18 months. So, we figured out our system and what works. So, I’d love to hear from you. You don’t have to give up the golden goose and tell everybody what you did, but I’m curious what your strategy has been to get this type of growth out of YouTube.  Lane Wagner:Good question. So, this is actually, is probably a good thing. I don’t have the typical, “Well, we grew a lot on YouTube.” Actually, my YouTube channel and my podcast channel has had growth, but it hasn’t been this astronomical thing that’s driven all the revenue. It’s been partnerships, primarily. So, collaborations with other YouTubers. So, a ton of legwork, Twitter DMs, emails, getting to know folks. I have a podcast, and you were a guest on my podcast, right? Getting to know people, writing great stuff that, kind of is adjacent to our product and getting in front of their audiences has, honestly been a huge growth channel for us. A lot of those people come in direct. So, they’ll hear about us on someone else’s YouTube channel or on someone else’s podcast and then come direct to our site, which is kind of hard to track, annoyingly enough, but we know that it’s the only thing working, so it has to be that. Right?  Rob Walling:Yep. To give folks an idea, obviously if you’ve never done backend development. You teach Python and Go. If you’ve never done it, or you want a refresher, or you want to get better at it … I was actually just clicking right before we hit record, going through your first Python demo course, and I was like, “I’m actually learning something.” So, it’s a B2C play, usually. I’d imagine you’re not selling to businesses, you’re selling to end users, who either want to become developers or who want to up their chops in these languages. How is that … I mean, my opinion, or my answer when people write in with questions about, “Hey, B2C. I’m going to do it,” and my answer is, “Don’t.” It’s jokingly, and there’s reasons. I mean, it’s not truly, don’t, obviously because you’re an example of a very successful business. Did 100 grand in revenue this last month. So, it’s not don’t, but there are, usually churn is high, and on and on. I’ve talked about all that stuff before. As you were building this business, did you know it would have the B2C issues, or really does it have the B2C issues? Is it relatively high churn, and is it little higher support than you’d like, and is it the typical, kind of B2C situation?  Lane Wagner:So, it does have some of the B2C issues. When I was early getting into this space, I was speaking with another founder of a company in the same industry who was farther along than we are. We’ve, kind of started to catch up now, which has been great, but they were quite a bit farther along than we were, back when I was talking to him. He’s like, “Just so you know, this space, churn is high,” and he’s not wrong. This is not a tool that, if you like it, you’ll just use it for the rest of your life. At the end of the day, whether someone succeeds with the product, goes through the course, learns a ton, gets a job, or fails, they get through the part that initially got them to sign up. There’s obviously, exceptions to that. Some people just love taking every new course that comes out. They’re big fans. But as a model, it is fundamentally different than a SaaS company. Then on the consumer side, actually we have not had that second thing you mentioned, which was support issues. I think that’s partially been how our entire team of three are all engineers, and we’ve engineered our way out of some of those problems, but they could have been bigger problems than they’ve been.  Rob Walling:You made a comment that I want to dig into. You said, “This is not really SaaS,” but technically it is a subscription for a tool to learn. So, technically we could say, “Oh, it is Software-as-a-Service,” but I think of it, the job to be done of Boot.dev, it could not be software, it could be someone driving to your house. The job to be done is teaching you how to uplevel your skills, or frankly just to learn from scratch, Python and Go. But when you say, you thought it was SaaS, but it’s not, what’s your thinking behind that comment?  Lane Wagner:Yeah. This really, I think, set me back quite a bit especially in the early days, just being confused about the business. This is my first company. It’s so deceiving for several reasons. First of all, Boot.dev is not like some of the other platforms that are essentially, videos where it’s really just a content play. You could put it up on any CMS and have a product. It’s a very interactive, kind of gamified environment. In my head I’m telling myself, “This is a different thing. This is not just content creation. This is like we’re building a product.” So, that was mistake number one, because exactly as you pointed out, what matters is the job to be done for the customer. Because the job to be done is training, then you fall into that industry. Having a different product is fantastic from a branding, finding a niche perspective, but the business model is fundamentally locked into the industry, or whatever the customer’s trying to get out of it  Rob Walling:Training.  Lane Wagner:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah. That’s a good, solid realization to have because then you realize the pros and cons of a training business versus trying to compare yourself to SaaS benchmarks, for example, which just aren’t going to make that much sense. I was impressed because right before we got on the call, it says, “Try your first course for free,” and I clicked and I expected it to be a video teaching me to do something, like Udemy, and it’s not. It’s fully interactive software that’s in the browser, and there’s a Python interpreter that, and the code appears, and you submit it, and you click on it. I was like, “Oh, this is pretty well-done.” This is not something that someone could replicate in a week because there’s code behind this. I say that because I know that there are a lot of courses out there to learn programming, backend, frontend whatever, but you’ve built something here that feels pretty unique, at least well, certainly for Python and Go, I think. Are you the only way to learn these on the internet in this fashion?  Lane Wagner:Most learning platforms, not only as we mentioned, are video-based, but another thing, is a lot of online learning in the programming space is based on the frontend. So, we’re going to get you started on the frontend, and if you want to learn backend, you can go watch a video, or maybe you can go get a CS degree. For whatever reason, it’s so undercatered to, and this really blew me away. It goes back to the origins of the company in the first place. I was a hiring manager. I managed a team of Go developers. Whenever I opened up a new job position, I’d get 10 applicants. My colleague who ran the frontend side of the stack for the same company, he’d open up a job application and get 150 bootcamp grads, or people who’d been through online learning platforms for the frontend side of the stack. I’m like, “What is going on? Only half of the backend developers on my team had CS degrees. It’s not like we required credentials.” I think there’s an argument to be made that learning the backend side of the stack takes a little bit longer, maybe 10 or 20% longer than the frontend side. It’s got a couple of more moving parts, but it’s not significant. Just no one was doing it, so we jumped on it. I’m glad we did when we did because I needed a full 18 months of absolute floundering in order to finally start to figure out how to get traction.  Rob Walling:Sometimes that’s how it goes. I mean, let’s talk a little bit about that, your origin story. You were writing technical blogs that developers were starting to read, and you were getting traffic. Then, what was the impetus to be like, “Well, devs are reading this. I want to teach them something”?  Lane Wagner:Yeah, so I’ve always been really into teaching. I was a tutor in college. Just really enjoy … My wife says I really like mansplaining things, and there’s definitely truth to that. There’s some founder fit in this company already. But no, early on it was blogs. Yeah, I was blogging on Medium, I was blogging on this other domain that we used to have, Qvault.io, and it had nothing to do with courses. It was whatever was interesting to me at the time, whatever I’m learning about in the programming space, which of course was all backend-oriented because I was a backend developer. Then it was really when I was this hiring manager, right? Hiring people, realizing how hard it was to find good backend developers. It was particularly tricky back in 2020 when the market was really good for developers. I was like, “We need to be training people on this stuff. I don’t know why we’re only training people on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.”  Rob Walling:That drives me nuts. So, folks here know that I once wrote code, and I consider … Back in my day, you did all of it, right? HTML, and you did some CSS, and you did JavaScript with no … It was before jQuery. I eventually used jQuery, but there weren’t all the frameworks for the frontend, but the bulk of my code was always backend. So, I would consider myself, if anything, a backend developer. So, it’s shocking to me that, I guess this shows my narrow lens of it, that all the sites cater to frontend. I mean, I say this with full disclosure through TinySeed, I’m invested in Frontend Mentor, which is a frontend development education, you know? So, I’m not against them at all, or learning frontend dev or whatever, but it just seems so weird to me that there would be this bias towards it. Is it seen as a simpler, “Oh, it’s easier to learn,” or, “It’s just easier to get more jobs in it,” or is there just “No …” Because there’s more jobs on backend, right?  Lane Wagner:Yeah. According to the last Stack Overflow survey, there’s twice as many self-identified backend developers as frontend developers, which gives you a demand. I mean, there’s a supply and a demand aspect to that, but that’s just that number. I think there’s a few things that go into it. I think the online learning world is, it’s hard to build Boot.dev, let me put it that way. It is hard to teach backend development interactively in a browser. It’s not as hard to do with the frontend because JavaScript, CSS and HTML all render in a browser, natively. Right? So, to build this interactive experience in a browser for backend developers is, there’s a lot more engineering work that you have to put in upfront, but I’m a big fan of, I don’t know if you’ve read Seth Godin’s Purple Cow book. I think in the long run, that’s actually a really good thing for us, because to replicate it. It’s a moat. Right? It’s something that sets us apart.  Rob Walling:Right. Usually, the things that are hard to do, if you grind through them and you slept through them, you get to the other side, A, you’re glad you didn’t know how hard it was going to be when you started because you never would’ve done it. But then you get to the other side and you’re like, “No one’s following me through that shit pile.” It’s like, “I’m going to be alone over here for a while,” and that’s a good thing. So, about just over a year ago, it was about 14, 15 months, Boot.dev was doing 6,000 a month, and you quit your day job. Obviously, you’ve had really nice growth since then, but what gave you the confidence to leave? You were an engineering lead, so I’m going to assume you were making pretty good money, or an engineering manager, right? You were actually managing people. What gave you the confidence to leave when you only had 6K of MRR?  Lane Wagner:So, let me go back six months before I quit my job. The year before that, Boot.dev had essentially been around for a year. We were under a different domain name at the time, and we’d had no growth. I felt like I’d been grinding just as hard then as I am now, just really trying to get this thing off the ground. Getting to $1,000 in revenue for a given month felt impossible, so hard to get traction. That six months leading up to when I eventually, actually quit my job, there were a few things that I feel like, we actually, kind of figured out. One was rebranding, one was niching down. Originally, I was just like, “I’m just going to teach Go. I know Go development. I’m just going to teach Go.” That niche was not strong enough. It wasn’t unique enough or distinct enough. There’s Go programming books. So, we started to figure out some things and we started to get traction. So, that was really what gave me the confidence even at just $6,000 in revenue to be like, “All right, I’m out of here,” because yeah, I was making almost 200K, or right around 200K in total compensation at the time.  Rob Walling:You also raised some funding, which I was really intrigued to hear because when I think about starting a site like this or a tool like this, in my head I’m like, “Oh, this is totally bootstrappable.”  Lane Wagner:Yeah.  Rob Walling:You know what I mean? This is something that you really could. Now I know there’s a software component to it that, as you’ve said, it took a lot of time to build, and it takes time to continue to expand, but I was a little surprised by the fact that you raised … Is it public, $330,000?  Lane Wagner:Yeah.  Rob Walling:Is that a public number? Yeah. $330,000 in August of ’22, around the same time you left your job. Why did you decide to do that rather than bootstrap it?  Lane Wagner:Yeah. So, I would say I’m 50-50 on the scale of risk-adverse to risk-taker. I’m probably not quite as much of a risk-taker as most entrepreneurs, but I definitely have some of that in me. My wife is extremely conservative, very, very conservative. So, the idea of me quitting right as we’re about to have our second baby and not be able to take paternity leave, paid paternity leave made her quite nervous. So, raising some cash and being able to take a salary, even though of course it was a much smaller salary without all the medical benefits and everything, definitely just gave us so much peace of mind. So, hindsight being what it is, there really was no reason to raise money. We’ve been profitable this entire year. We have more money in the bank now than what we raised, but at the time just knowing the information I knew. I had projected, I was like, “It would be really great, if by,” what’s the date, “November of 2023, we have it a month where we make $30,000.” That was the goal, and here we are at 110, but that’s what I was planning for.  Rob Walling:You never could plan that you were going to grow like this. So, it’s that whole thing of, just because the decision didn’t pan out the way you thought it would, doesn’t mean it was the wrong decision at the time. Right? You made the best decision you could with the information.  Lane Wagner:Yeah.  Rob Walling:So, when you think about a long-term play here, you have investors. Investors, typically want to return at some point. Usually, that’s an exit. There are some exceptions, like the TinySeed terms and SparkToro, where you can pull out dividends because you’re structured in a way that, that makes sense, and you pay investors dividends over time. Again, I have one or two angel investments of my own out of 20 that do that too, as well, that actually pay dividends. Well, I guess at SparkToro, I’m an investor in and then there’s two others, but the usual one is to have an exit, right? I need to sell within five to 10 years or whatever it is. Also, founders get bored and decide they want to sell eventually, but you’re still early. I mean, you’re really … I know you’re three years into it, but really you’re full-time free just over a year. So, I don’t expect you to be thinking about what’s going to happen 10 years from now, but does that cross your mind of, “How do I pay investors back? What’s the future hold for me?”  Lane Wagner:Yeah, absolutely. When I raised with the investors, first of all, these investors are awesome. I actually knew them from before, which is why I only pitched one investor. I raised from that investor, and that’s all the raising we’ve done. I don’t think we’re going to raise any more. The conversation, originally was like, “Hey, I have this platform. We seem to have found the traction thing, and I have different ideas for some growth levers we can pull. I think they’ll work, but I want to quit and go full-time on this. I’ve been doing it 15 hours a week,” or whatever. “I don’t know if we’ll sell this company.” That was the conversation I had to have with the investors. “I don’t know if this is a thing that we sell. I don’t know if this is a sellable thing. It’s not a SaaS application. It’s not a recurring revenue tool. It’s an education platform.” It certainly could have an exit. There’s no reason we can’t, but I just had to be super upfront with them. “Maybe we just do distributions.” Right? So, we raised a million-dollar valuation, so they bought a third of the business. We could just do distributions at that point.  Rob Walling:Right, because at typical valuations you get half a percent, 1%, 2% of a company, and then it’s like, “Great, for every $100,000 you pull out, I get $1,500.” It doesn’t make sense, but if the investors have that much, that does make it a little more palatable.  Lane Wagner:It also changes how you compensate employees. So, rather than just doing the standard, “We’re going to give employees options, and then maybe they have this big windfall when we go public,” I’ve had to be a little more conscientious. Right? So, we basically have a split program, where we do the options thing just in case we sell, but also, kind of a profit sharing plan on top of that just because we don’t know if we’re going to sell.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s nice to have that, to provide both options. I’d love to hear if there has ever been a moment in the life of Boot.dev, where you were really not enjoying it, like the worst lows, where you were either up at night or you were, “I want to throw in the towel. This sucks. Why did I become an entrepreneur? I should go back and be a full-time employee.”  Lane Wagner:2021 was an awful year. So, I wrote the first course and launched a very, very small MVP of the platform in 2020. I can’t even remember, exactly the month. It was right after COVID, so it was summer, spring of 2020, but it was a new fun project, no customers. I did all the classic things, had zero distribution channels. So, I just published this thing no one used and I thought it was, kind of fun. 2021, I was trying to get customers that entire year and we had, effectively no growth. There was a time, I remember it was early in 2021. I was like, “Can I just get rid of this thing? It’s causing me more mental … It’s more taxing on me mentally than it’s worth, and I can’t just put it down. It’s making 500 bucks a month,” or whatever. So, I can’t just kill it, but it’s destroying me mentally. So anyways, I went on Reddit and I was like, “Someone want to buy this thing? Does anyone want this?” The result of that conversation was actually that I found someone that was interested in helping me market it, and great person. They were super nice, super smart. They were in a different industry. We tried for all of 2021 to market this thing and we absolutely failed. We had no growth in 2021. It was terrible. So, I actually bought my section of the business back from him. He put in a bunch of sweat equity over the course of the year, and at the end of the year I just bought it back from him and I’m like, “I don’t know what to do.” So, we tried a few more things and it started to work. Beginning of 2022, we started actually seeing some growth getting up into the two, the three, the 5K monthly revenue numbers.  Rob Walling:What were you doing differently, because there are a bunch of people listening to this right now, who have a business doing 500 or 1,000, and it has been. They’re like, “I don’t know what to do.” Not that your solution will work for everyone, but I’m just curious if you can touch on … If you even know, because sometimes you don’t, but what did you start doing differently that got you from the plateau to actually a pretty good business?  Lane Wagner:There were three things that we all did in fairly rapid succession, so I actually can’t be sure exactly which one was the most impactful, but I will list all three that I’ve had time to reflect on. The first is that this guy that I was doing marketing with in 2021 was not an engineer, was not a developer. It is really hard to write good copy, to come up with good messaging for an audience that you don’t know very much about. So, one thing I’ve definitely learned over the last couple of years is thinking about hiring a marketer or thinking about using a contractor. Marketing, almost is not a specialty in and of itself. It’s like, you need to be good at marketing to this audience, or you need to be extremely familiar with what they want, what they need, what the content they consume online. You need to hang out where they hang out. Right? So, I just found that, that wasn’t working. That actually, at least in that moment, I could do a much better job just because I knew how to talk to these people. That was a big turning point. Rebranding the site was a big one. I read this book. I’ll probably reference it a couple of times because I really do think this was probably the biggest turning point for the company, was just reading this book called The Purple Cow by Seth Godin. It’s all about finding a unique niche, because this is a crowded market. There’s a lot of people teaching courses online in lots of industries, but especially programming. Programmers love to share their knowledge. So, you really have to figure out how to stand out. We did a bunch of stuff, visually, with the name, with focusing on the backend side of the stack that really allowed us to start getting more word of mouth marketing, because nobody wants to talk about another learn to code platform. No matter how good you think your courses are, you need something else that’s remarkable. Something else that someone will talk about. That was another big one.  Rob Walling:What’s the purple cow for Boot.dev? What is it, the thing that people talk about?  Lane Wagner:We have two, which might be antithetical to the thesis of the book, but I still think it’s correct for us. The first is the focus on the backend. Just no one else is doing this, which is frankly, kind of lucky. We, kind of stumbled into that. I just happened to be a backend developer, and everyone else is teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So, that’s the big one. You could even sub-niche it and say, “Go is not the most popular backend programming language, but it’s the one that we focus on, primarily.” So again, we get a lot of attention in Go communities for that reason. It’s much, much easier to get traction in a small community than in a large one. It’s not even close, which is another thing that I really made a mistake of in the beginning. Qvault.io, back in the day was a very generic. I was just branding it as this, “Come, learn to code. We happen to have this course on Go and this course on Python,” or whatever, but the messaging was all extremely generic, because you like to tell yourself that this thing could be big, right? Anyone could use this thing. I think that’s such a huge trap.  Rob Walling:Was that both purple cows? You named the one of niching.  Lane Wagner:Oh, yeah. The other one is the gamification. This one’s more recent. I’ve always enjoyed e-learning that leans heavily into the admission that we are human, and that we like hits of dopamine, and that we have all these things, these very human things. We’re not mechanical when we learn, and there’s not a lot of learn to code websites that lean into that. So, just every month it feels like we’re leaning harder and harder into that messaging. I don’t know if you saw on the site, it feels like this fantasy game. Our mascot is this wizard bear, and everything we do is around unlocking achievements, and earning XP, and getting on the leaderboard. That’s all really good and is based in pretty well-known psychological principles about getting yourself to keep coming back and keep learning, but it’s also just super unique. Nobody else is doing it.  Rob Walling:Very nice. Yeah, I do. Of course, I’m a fantasy nerd myself, and so I like the visuals on the site. It seems like you’re catering pretty well. Before we wrap up, you had commented earlier about how you originally thought of Boot.dev as SaaS. It’s not really SaaS, it’s training. Also, before we hit record, I was asking you for MRR and you mentioned your gross revenue of 110, and I said, “Oh, what’s MRR?” You said, “Well, MRR’s 50K, but that’s not the right metric to look at for this business.” What did you mean by that?  Lane Wagner:Yeah, so Stripe shows us our monthly recurring revenue. Out of the box, Stripe defaults to SaaS metrics. For a long time, I really worried about that one. There’s a couple of reasons I don’t think it’s important, or as important for us. Again, this threw us off. We’ve been a subscription revenue company, and that really, to a new founder that doesn’t understand all these different business models, really confused me. I was comparing myself and my metrics to other SaaS companies, and that’s not the right way to think about it. So for example, our net revenue in, what was it? October of 2023, $110,000. Our recurring revenue, about $50,000. Our revenue that came in that, was recurring was $30,000. There’s a distinction, right? The actual money that came in the door, that rolled over from yearlies last year, and monthlies of the month before. This is not a tool, where people stick around forever if they like it. People drop out for all sorts of reasons. So, our churn is much higher than the traditional, what is it? One to 4% of a SaaS company.  Rob Walling:A healthy SaaS company. Yeah.  Lane Wagner:Of a healthy SaaS company, exactly. Yeah, what we are actually optimizing for is just lifetime value of a customer. Is our lifetime value of a customer in a healthy spot, and can we acquire customers at a price that’s lower than that? Ideally, much lower than that, and then you get better margins. Right? But every year, this is another interesting thing because you actually do have some advantages. This all sounds worse. This is just worse. This is worse than SaaS, but there are some nice things. Word of mouth is much higher in this industry than in other industries. So, if people really like your thing, they’re much more likely to share it than, I think is the baseline in, maybe SaaS tooling, B2B SaaS tooling specifically.  Rob Walling:For someone listening who’s trying to get their head around why you have $110,000 in revenue, but MRR is 50K and actual recurring revenue is 30K. We won’t go through all the math because on a podcast it would be terrible, but the idea is that when you sell annual plans, you can’t recognize, you shouldn’t recognize all that revenue in that month. Usually, let’s say for easy math, your annual plan, you have an annual plan for $348 a year and then you have a monthly membership for $49 a month. So, you sell a lot of annual plans because it’s almost half the price to just pay annually. Right?  Lane Wagner:It’s about a 50-50 split of about half our customers do annuals, half do monthlies, but of course there’s more revenue, immediately from the yearlies. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Right. So, you get a bunch of that cash upfront, which is great. It means you have money to market. It means just getting cash upfront is always good, but for someone who’s never thought about how … I’m going to do a simple math example of, if I sell an annual plan for $1,200, what I should do if I’m doing my accounting right, is divide 1,200 by 12 and recognize $100 of MRR per month for the next 12 months. So, that’s what you’re doing with your 348. That’s why the numbers are all different. It can be deceptive in either direction. If you do all annual plans, you get a ton of cash upfront, but your MRR seems really low.  Lane Wagner:Yeah, we think about it as, essentially we’re selling a product that’s being financed over an amount of time. Right? Because these dollar amounts are so low, we don’t actually have a contract for you to sign, and we’re doing loan terms, and interest. It’s more just like, you want to get access to this thing for six months. You’re financing the total cost of the course over the six months that you’re accessing it, which makes us think about it, again in terms of lifetime value of the customer, which is somewhere between $100 and $300. There’s averages in there. That third point about the revenue that I made way back when that, I’m sure everyone’s forgot about, was we do care about this number that is the actual dollar amount coming in every month.  Rob Walling:The cash coming?  Lane Wagner:Yeah, and it’s even lower at present because of our really fast growth that we’ve had recently, than the actual MRR. So, our SaaS MRR is for 50K. The actual cash coming in from recurring revenue every month is down into the 30K range. But that’s an important metric to just keep in mind because it’s like, if we do no marketing, if we bring in no new people this month, how much cash is coming in the door? So, keeping a tab on that is actually really important.  Rob Walling:Lane Wagner, thanks so much for joining me today. Folks want to keep up with you on Twitter. You are wagslane, that’s W-A-G-S L-A-N-E. Of course, Boot.dev if they want to see what you’re working on.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and this week is kind of a Hot Take Tuesday but to be honest my two guests were unable to make it. One got sick and the other one had a pretty gnarly schedule, and I have no flexibility later this week because I’m traveling and we have MicroConf Remote and I’m giving a talk, etc, etc. So you’ll notice more episodes than usual over the past month or two have been solo episodes, and that has been because of my schedule. I have very limited time in front of my computer these days and trying to schedule folks to actually record an episode, whether it’s an interview or a Hot Take Tuesday it just hasn’t worked out. So even though I had this on the calendar with two guests planned, here we are with me and several topics to talk through today. But rest assured, as my schedule calms down over the next few weeks we will settle back in to our normal Startups For the Rest of Us schedule and one more thing. We’ve recently reopened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track, it’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other and discussing wins, challenges and frankly how to grow faster. A couple of months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your requests. With MicroConf Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks, like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out, microconfconnect.com. So I want to cover a few topics today, one of which is more of a, Rob, solo adventure topic and the others are things from the news that I had put together for this episode of Hot Take Tuesday. The first topic ties into an episode of the podcast that went live a couple of weeks ago about things startup founders should never do, and I listed seven things in that episode. In between the time I recorded that episode and a couple of days ago, I realized there’s another one. And of course I think this will be a fun Startups For the Rest of Us drinking game over the course of the next year or two. That every time we all collectively as a community think of the next thing that folks should never do we can all take a sip of an adult beverage. But this one popped up during a conversation I was having with friend of the show, Ruben Gomez, and we were texting back and forth about different things. And I realized that an eighth thing that startup founders should never do is to take funding and then start side projects. And the reason for this is that three of the things that lead to your success as a founder are focus, focus and focus. I say it jokingly a bit, right? Obviously there’s a lot of other attributes of founders that make them successful and unsuccessful. But I do see a lack of focus as a major red flag with founders and in fact, when we’re interviewing founders for TinySeed. If we get a lot of pushback about asking them to say go full-time on their startup, or someone who we notice is all over the place doing the indie hacker dream where they have five or six different products. I would never invest in that person because they don’t have commitment to one idea or one company or one product to be able to push it forward in the way that it’s going to need to be to become a successful product. And I think of success these days as it’s a seven or eight or a nine figure ARR company, usually seven or eight figure. And trying to have a bunch of things going on, starting side projects that you’re investing quite a bit of time in and taking seriously and actually launching and working on it is this interesting drain of your creative energy. And I know some of you out there are hearing this and saying, “That actually makes me better at what I do. You know what? Once I’ve had one or two drinks I’m actually a better driver.” Which was the whole cliche what in the ’80s and ’90s. But seriously I get it, we all have entrepreneurial ADHD and I would love nothing more than to work on five or six different things. Because you know what? It allows me to always be stimulated, it allows me to feel creative and it allows me to spread my efforts across a bunch of stuff. But that’s precisely the negative impact that it has is I’m spreading my creative thoughts, my creative energy and my time and my attention across side projects and my main company. So there’s no reason that you can’t work on two, three, five, 10 things at once you should go do that, but what you shouldn’t do is take investment for one of those. Because any investor, especially venture capitalists and especially professional angels and especially accelerators will require that you do not continue working nights and weekends or maybe it’s during the day. Right? No one’s watching you, but that you continue to work on these side projects, launching these things, promoting these things. It’s a terrible signal. Now, you may find friends and family or you may find inexperienced angel investors who are willing to give you money. If you are playing Dungeons and Dragons on the side and you have a Dungeons and Dragons podcast or you run an event for startup founders most people don’t care. But it’s when you are essentially launching other products that are also software. Right? That are also SaaS. You can’t grow three SaaS companies at once, no one does this. Right? It’s an anti-pattern. You can grow one and then have a couple that are flailing around and so if people see you tweeting about one, two, three, four, five, different projects at once. It’s pretty obvious that you’re not giving any one of those the attention they deserve and so the solution, if you do want to work on multiple things or you want to be able to start side projects don’t take investment. Investment only works in certain situations and although I have my 1990 rule, which is I think about 1% of tech startups should consider raising venture. I think about 9% should consider raising what I call indie funding, which is TinySeed, Indie.vc, Upeka, and the other alt VC funds that you might hear about, and then 90% should probably bootstrap. And I think that if you want to do a bunch of products, and this comes from someone like myself who at one point had somewhere between nine and a dozen depending on how you count products, all generating revenue. But I didn’t raise money for those, and when I went to focus on HitTail I didn’t raise money for that either because I wanted it to be a lifestyle business. The only one that I would’ve considered raising money for was Drip and then frankly TinySeed, because I’m focused on those and committed to those and you might say, “Well, Rob, you work on TinySeed and MicroConf, and you have this podcast.” And that’s true, but if you look at them they’re all in the same ecosystem and it’s this virtuous cycle of all three of these things feeding into one another in a good way. Everything I do for MicroConf helps the podcast and vice versa. Everything I do with MicroConf helps TinySeed and vice versa. Each of these things feeds on each other and they’re all growing and supporting one another and I also have teams of people running these companies. If you think I’m in the nitty-gritty of every decision that’s being made at all the companies I work on you would be incorrect. Now, there’s a vision and a direction and high level guidance and advising that I’m giving. But if any of these were a SaaS company that I was trying to grow I would need to focus on it almost full-time. Now, I ran MicroConf and this podcast on the side. Mike, and I did this essentially as a hobby and it was a side project and when I went to sell Drip I actually got in a conversation with our acquirer and the CEO asked me, he said, “Are you going to keep doing these things on the side, the MicroConf and the podcast?” And I said, “I am. That’s been part of my personal brand, I actually think it’s beneficial for Drip and it’s something I think I will do for decades.” And he was okay with that. But what he wouldn’t have been okay with or I don’t think he should have been okay with is if I said I’m going to sell this to you, I’m going to come work for you for a year or two, and while I do that I’m going to launch a side project or four side projects. Because I get bored with stuff and because this one isn’t working and so I’m going to hop to the next one. I didn’t do that and it’s anti-pattern, it’s a bad signal and so it’s tough because as much as anyone I like starting new stuff, as much as anyone I have entrepreneurial ADHD I know that. But the founders that I see succeeding are the ones that focus on something for enough time to get it off the ground and to get it to escape velocity and that takes focus. So to recap, the eighth thing that startup founders shouldn’t do is to take funding and then start a bunch of side projects. My second topic of the day is more of a Hot Take Tuesday topic I was going to discuss with my other two co-hosts, but I have some thoughts on this and I’m pretty intrigued by it to be honest. This is an article from Slashdot, I know you haven’t heard that website in ages, have you? I haven’t read Slashdot well over a decade. I was never super into it, but I found it to be a pretty decent source of nerdy news stories that kind of relate to this podcast and that can be discussed on a Hot Take Tuesday episode. So the headline is, “Facebook and Instagram to offer subscriptions for no ads in Europe.” To comply with evolving EU regulations Meta says they’re introducing a new subscription option in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. It’s going to cost $10.50 cents a month if you buy on the web or $13.75 cents a month if you buy on iOS and Android. My take, I would pay for this in a heartbeat. I actually like the idea of having freemium and paid versions of all these systems. Because it allows someone like me who doesn’t want to see ads and who has the means to eliminate the ads and on YouTube, I have been paying for whatever YouTube Premium I think it’s called. I’ve been paying for that for years. For so long in fact that if I wind up on YouTube in an incognito browser I’m shocked and appalled at the pure volume of ads that are coming my way. I forget, I forget that YouTube has ads as crazy as that sounds. But you know what? My 17-year-old, my 13-year-old, they’re not going to pay this much and so they can still use the product and be ad supported and that’s what I like about this kind of thing. I don’t use Facebook at all, I deleted it from my phone about eight months ago and I only use Instagram for it’s to keep up with a few people in a niche hobby that I’m in. But my hope is that Meta looks to roll this out worldwide. I don’t know that they will unless the US requires it because this is EU regulations that are essentially requiring them to do this and given that Meta is in the ads business. Right? That’s where they make their money. I don’t know that they want to cap their upside by having a subscription that they then have to increase the price of every year and take a bunch of flack like all the streaming providers do. So it remains to be seen if this will come to the US, but any of these systems that want to do this why not give us the option? And if you do this they won’t use your information for ads because they’re not serving you ads. And I like that even more to be able to pay for that privilege while again having the option for folks who can’t afford it to still be able to use the free version. So I’m envious of you, EU, EEA and Switzerland, I hope you take advantage of this once it’s available. Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

No, actually it’s so funny to look at Hacker News threads and to see the first comment or the comment that’s all the way to the left as you scroll down. Right? So it’s the ones that are the main comments responding to the original poster. Those comments for the most part are pretty intelligent, well-thought-out and helpful. Now, the further you scroll down they’re not. But what happens is you get someone post an intelligent comment and then it instantly devolves into this pissing contest and this argument between people who it’s pretty obvious like you have no idea what you’re talking about. Or wow, dude, you are way too opinionated about something that no one else cares about and/or pedantic trying to correct a word someone wrote. And they write a 500 word response and you disagree with a single word of their response because that’s totally worth talking about. So anyways, it never ceases to amaze me both the value you can get from Hacker News and also what a mistake it can be to actually read into the comments. But this thread is an Ask HN where the OP says in, Paul Graham’s, essay he talks about manually doing what you later plan to automate. So this is the essay do things that don’t scale, and in the essay PG gives the example of Stripe manually onboarding startups. Does anyone else have other examples? And I really like this thought process. What’s funny is manually onboarding startups like Stripe did was considered, it was like, whoa, you can do that? No one does that. And that was what, 2012, 13, 14? It was in that range. Nowadays, anyone who’s starting out I would say manually onboard your first 20 customers. Don’t write any code, figure out what the hiccups are, figure out how long it takes them to get onboarded and to get value and that will inform the duration of your trial and even run billing manually for a while. One of the first things that we did when we were getting Drip off the ground, was not write any billing code. There was no subscription code, I believe we could accept their credit card through a form… No, actually we didn’t even have that. We would manually create an account, and this is for maybe the first 20 or 30 trial users really most became customers. We’d manually create an account, Derek, would do this in the console, into the database directly. So then they would have a login, they could reset their password and they could log in and they could use it and there was no billing page. There was nowhere to enter a credit card and I was manually working with folks mostly via email. I think I did a little bit of a Skyping, because this was pre-Zoom, so we would literally jump on Skype to show you how long ago it was. And I would just tell them, “Look, don’t pay anything before we get value and if you never get value just don’t pay anything. But I’m going to check in with you every week or two and let’s figure out how to get this installed and how to get you using this and whether or not it’s more valuable to you than the current tool you are using.” And I learned a ton about this. I learned that from the time you installed the code, it was about 14 days until you maybe had enough subscribers that it kind of made sense that Drip was valuable for you and we had folks in the system that would eventually say, “All right, I feel like I’m getting value. I want to start paying you.” And I had told them it’s going to be $49 a month. And so what I was going to do was go directly into Stripe to log into stripe.com and I was going to take their credit card and type it in. But, Derek, said, “No, let’s get a page up and let’s get a page in the app so they can enter it. It’s all secure, you don’t have to get on a phone call with them and it’ll make sure everything’s synced between our database and Stripe.” And so in an hour or two he hacked something together that allowed them to enter their credit card, post it to Stripe to get the customer token and now we could bill them. The thing was we didn’t have any code written to bill people and that was okay, and we ran like this for months and I would set a calendar reminder in Google Calendar that after 30 days or a month I would go in and I remember billing, Brennan Dunn, manually. And I remember billing several other early customers going into Stripe and literally clicking a button that said charge this much and that doesn’t scale. And that sounds a little crazy, but it saved us hours of development that we were pushing towards other things, features that actually made a difference to our customers. And eventually of course, Derek, created a little billing engine and we put a rig task into the system. A Cron job for those who aren’t familiar with Ruby and Rails and set it to run every night, check if anybody needed to get billed. We did all that eventually. But I mean building that takes time, right? It takes how many to QA it and to write the unit tests and to make sure it runs because man, you don’t want to screw up billing. That took time and we pushed that off as far as we can. It was literally months and months and we had I would say 20 people using the app willing to pay for it before we cranked up the subscription engine. Another thing we did, this is less about things that don’t scale but this is top of mind for me. Because I did a call about a month or two ago, someone backed the SaaS Playbook Kickstarter and they backed it at the level where they could do a one-on-one conversation with me. I don’t do consulting, but I made just a handful of spots available where people could pay it was either 800 or $1000 and they could talk to me for 45 minutes and those all sold out. It was great. But someone had the question of what can I leave out of the app? When people talk about an MVP, what does it really need to do and what can I leave out? And one example I gave her was in Drip, which was an email service provider. Think of it like a competitor to MailChimp, it’s a little different but you get the idea. You can create emails, you can send them to people and you can send sequences and there’s some automations. We had no delete buttons anywhere, so you could create a broadcast email, a one time broadcast, you could send that or it would be a draft. But if you decided that you wanted to delete it, we had to literally go into the console and delete it out of the database directly. There was nothing in the user interface to delete anything. In fact, there was no searching anywhere. So if you’d had 100 or 200 broadcasts at the time that you wanted to search through, you couldn’t and it actually took us a year or two to get to adding search. But in the early days, no one had 200 of those. So they didn’t need a way to sort or search or really even delete. For the most part, people would just rename it and use it next week if they had mistyped something or if they’d created a broadcast they didn’t want to use. We got shockingly little pushback about this. As developers who have worked on complete systems that are mature five, 10, 15 years in this piece of code or this application does all this stuff. You can’t imagine not writing sort and search and delete buttons and reorder and all the basic functionality of what you might think of something in a table layout, but you don’t need much of that. You need almost none of it, you need to display it and you need to allow them to do what is the minimum viable action for that screen. It’s to create a new thing and it’s to edit that new thing and in this case it’s an email, so it’s to send that new thing. But that was it, everything else we pushed off as long as we could and sometimes we did get some pushback. I can’t believe… Put in quotes, “I cannot believe that you don’t have any delete buttons.” And I’d respond with, “Yeah, I appreciate that. And if you want us to delete something send us the name of it or whatever and we’ll delete it for you.” But honestly, we are so busy providing value to our customers at this point and there are more valuable things to be building than delete buttons. To wrap up this topic, as I read this in this Hacker News thread the number one response to doing things that don’t scale is actually super interesting. So the comment is from one of the co-founders of Lugg, which is lugg.com and Lugg’s H1 is move anything with the push of a button. So it’s about actually moving furniture and such and one of the co-founders posted and they said, “At Lugg we did a few things that would not scale. Number one, my co-founder and I did all the lugs ourselves in trucks we rented through Getaround for the first four months. My co-founder and I’s names, pictures and phone numbers were hard coded into the app as the crew to fulfill the lug before we had crews or proper dispatching.” And this is Rob cutting and see if you’re going to do a two-sided marketplace, this is it. They were one side of the marketplace and it must’ve been incredibly local. I don’t know where they lived, but then… Oh, they’re in the Bay Area, it looks like the next one they talk about being in Emeryville. So they lived in a city big enough where there was enough demand because if you lived in a tiny little town this wouldn’t work. But living in a big enough city and then being willing to grind it out like these guys did, it’s pretty impressive. The third bullet is, “We launched without payments and would charge customers with a square reader at the door.” That’s amazing. Fourth one, “Most mornings we would camp out in the IKEA parking lot in Emeryville, California.” That’s in the East Bay, “And approach customers that were struggling to get their purchases in their cars and we pitched them that we would deliver their items if they downloaded the app and made a request. In the early days, we didn’t have operating hours and anyone could request a lug at any time and my co-founder and I would hop in our rented truck and do it. A few months in we did a lug for someone that knew, Sam Altman, and made an intro for us. We met him for coffee shortly after had a YC interview and we were later accepted in the spring of 15 batch.” So that’s eight years ago. This is not something that I would personally do, it doesn’t sound fun. But talk about grinding and doing what it takes to get the job done, right? And if you’re going to do a two-sided marketplace, as I said this is how you do it. But also none of that scales, but all they were doing was just trying to prove things out and just trying to learn and if you think about that that’s what doing things that don’t scale is about. And there are a lot of companies that apply to TinySeed that we talk to and some that get in that are doing the human automation man or woman behind the curtain just pedaling like a duck under the water like crazy to get the service done just to prove that there’s a need. Because if you prove there’s a need and you prove that you can sell it and you prove that people are willing to pay for it, fulfilling the service and automating that, writing it in code is often not the hard part. It’s usually not the hard part. The hard part is just figuring out what is it that people want? How do I build something that people want? How do I offer something that people want and are willing to pay for? And however, you can validate that obviously assuming you’re doing it ethically and you’re doing it in a way that allows you to learn. I’m all for doing things that don’t scale in the early days and that’s going to wrap us up for this week’s episode. Thanks for joining me this week, I know it was kind of a mashup of multiple episode types and it’s one of these weeks where the show has to go on. I wanted to get an episode out to you. I hope it was valuable to you to hear the insights I had to share on these topics and as always, I’ll be back again next week with another episode.

But I knew Derek was a baller developer, but I knew he also wrote really maintainable, high quality, scalable code. And so if it took an extra few days or an extra few weeks on a larger project to ship something, I was willing to live with that because I wanted long-term to have a code base in a company that would scale. Unlike some companies that we see where you get this non-technical founder who hires a Dev or has kind of a minority technical co-founder, and they drive them and push them to write code faster and faster and faster. And the code is, and then they get to a million, 3 million, 5 million in ARR and they stop. They lock up. You can’t build features because nothing is maintainable. You can’t add new things because you break old things. There’s no unit tests, there’s just low quality code. Welcome to another episode of Startups for the Rest of Us, I’m Rob Walling, and today I answer listener questions. Some text questions from all the way back in January of this year, so it is at 10 months and I sprinkle in some video questions as well. Before we dive into that, we are running the next edition of the State of Independent SaaS survey and report. Through MicroConf we’ve run the survey a couple of times and then we decided to take a last year off because the information coming through wasn’t changing. The survey is about 40 questions. It takes less than 10 minutes to complete if you have your metrics handy. And then we take that data from what usually winds up being between 600 and 1,000 independent SaaS companies. These are bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS companies, and we compile a report with all the key findings and helpful industry benchmarks that you don’t get anywhere else. The survey closes soon. We could really use your input. All the data is kept anonymous and every survey response we get makes the report that much better. Head to stateofindiesaas.com to complete the survey, and we’re going to enter everyone who completes a survey into a drawing for a free ticket to MicroConf US 2024 in Atlanta. That’s more than a $1,000 value. I know it’s a lot for me to ask you for 10 minutes out of your busy day, but it really would go a long way towards making this year’s report the best yet. We are mixing it up this year asking different questions and pulling out different findings than you’ve seen in the past. So even if you’ve filled out a prior survey, it’d be amazing if you could head to stateofindiesaas.com and complete it. Before we dive into that. Tickets for MicroConf Local in Austin, November 14th of this year are on sale and they are going fast. If you are a Bootstrap SaaS founder in the Austin area, you don’t want to miss out. The location is the WP Engine HQ and the guest of honor is Bernard Wang, the co-founder of Clear Scope. We’re also going to have founder by founder, which is an amazing source of networking and building new relationships. You can head to MicroConf.com/locals to get your ticket today. Tickets are only $50, so if you’re in the area, it is 100% worth your time to check out this event. Our very own Tracy Osborne, whom you’ve heard on the show, will be MCing the event and doing a fireside chat with Bernard. It’s just a couple hours in the afternoon of November 14th from 3:00 – 6:00 PM. With some conversation, some meeting of other founders in your area, and a nice happy hour at the WP engine headquarters. Microcomp.com/locals to grab your ticket. And one more thing, we’ve recently reopened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other and discussing wins, challenges and frankly how to grow faster. A couple months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your requests. With MicroConf Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out MicroConfconnect.com. And with that, let’s dive into my first listener question. The person who wrote in asked to be kept anonymous and he and I, it looks like have a long email chain starting back in 2020. But in this email, which came in January of 2023, so about 10 months ago, he says, “Rob, I like to imagine if I had a podcast that reached thousands upon thousands of entrepreneurs, I’d want to know if I was impacting them. While I’m quite certain you already know this, we’ve been exchanging a couple emails every year for the last three-ish years, and whenever I have a question I want to send to the pod, I like giving you an update. Last we spoke, I had launched a new product with zero MRR that’s now $5,200 of MRR and my original product is at $3,000 of MRR. This doesn’t include one time sales. With all of this, I crossed more than a quarter million dollars in revenue for 2022”. So that’s a great update. That’s why I want to keep him anonymous is because he’s giving me real revenue numbers. But it’s so cool to hear about listeners growing their business and using the tactics and the motivation that come from this podcast to do it. So now let’s dive into his question. “My question for you is, with the economy starting to tighten up, I feel myself not only tightening up too, but wanting to get as much cash as I possibly can. What I mean is that five years ago making $300,000 seems so out of touch, but now that I’m here, I want more and I feel bad for it”. This is Rob jumping in. This is called hedonic adaptation and it’s that we adapt to the amazing luxuries that we earn over our lives and those just become necessities at a certain point. Back to the email, “in my head, I’m blaming the economy because I think I might need the money, but it also just feels like greed as a one man show, $250,000 to $300,000 a year is more than I need, but as I make more money, I want more things. Maybe there’s nothing wrong with that, but it feels wrong. Have you gone through something similar? When is it enough? Thanks, Rob, from someone that has followed the stair step approach. It’s been a long but very rewarding journey”. Yet another person who’s embraced the stair-step approach to what amounts to pretty amazing success. So this is an interesting question and obviously a philosophical one. What’s interesting is that at a certain point around 2009 or ’10, so it was a long time ago, that’s when I was making about $120 to $150,000 a year and I was working like 10 hours a week. And enough was enough. I didn’t feel like I needed more money because it paid our bills, it made the house payment, and I loved the relaxed pace of life that I could maintain. And then we had our second son. I was able to hang out with him hours and hours a week and we would walk around town or I would walk around town with him strapped in a baby Bjorn and really just enjoyed that time. For me eventually I got bored and wanted to start something bigger, and that’s when I bought HitTail. But it was also, there was an incredible 18 months where I launched the Micropreneur Academy, which is kind of a precursor to MicroConf Connect. I wrote, Start Small, Stay Small. Started Startups for the Rest of Us, and we started MicroConf. All four of those things happened within 18 months. So it was an incredibly fruitful period in my career, and the reason I was able to do that is because I wasn’t working full-time anymore and all of a sudden I had all this time each week to just tool around and be creative and launch things. So for me, the motivation to up my entrepreneurial game or do the next thing wasn’t about money. It was about ambition and boredom and challenge and learning and creativity. I wanted to do something new that really challenged me. Now, at the same time, my wife and I had a couple conversations where I asked her specifically, I said, “what would we do with more money?” And I think I talked about this in the SaaS playbook or I’ve talked about it on this show before, but she sat down and was like, “if we had an extra couple thousand dollars a month, we would get an apartment on the coast”. And not only would that change our quality of life, because we didn’t love living in Fresno, California. It’s not necessarily our soulmate city, but living on the coast was something that we wanted to do. And so just having more money gives you more options basically. And she said, “we could be generous with that apartment and we could be more generous with our money and we could go see family more”. And she came up with all these things that weren’t just luxuries and they weren’t frivolous. They were things that really made sense. And suddenly I was like, “you know what? I don’t need to be a millionaire, but if I made another $1,000, $2000, $3,000 a month, I became motivated that we could do good with that money. And whether that good meant improving our own lives and the quality of those and enjoying those days more, being able to spend more time with your kids or sometimes maybe it’s less time with your kids and hiring someone to be with them so you can stay sane or whether it’s to help other people to give back however you see it. Money did become a motivator for me. But not to my detriment, it was actually a positive thing. And that was where I bought hitTail, I grew it and by the time I sold it all the revenue I made from HitTail as well as the sale price was a million dollars. And I had never, you’ve heard my story, a construction worker whose dad was an electrician. I just never encountered that type of money, and that was a shift in my life where I realized, “oh, money does make things easier and money gives you options”. Money gives you options to where if bad things happen, if your car gets hit-and-run, if your car breaks down, if a landlord screws you and keeps your security deposit, if someone steals something from you, any of these losses, all of which I’ve encountered, used to be a huge deal. Catastrophic, right? I don’t have these thousands of dollars to repair my car. Having more money made me more relaxed in life. And so that’s the way I think about it these days. And I actually gave a MicroConf talk called 11 Years to Overnight Success and it’s on YouTube and in it I talk about how I was seeking freedom through entrepreneurship. That’s really what I wanted was to own all of my time. And once I achieved freedom, I realized how tenuous it was because I often say I was the original indie hacker. I had nine different websites, applications, eBooks, and each of them made between $1,000 and $5,000 a month. But at any given time, some of them would get smacked by Google and I would lose interest in one or it would just, but bad things would happen. A competitor would come and suddenly I didn’t rank for the terms I needed to rank for and it made me realize that my freedom was tenuous and I had this nightmare of having to go back to consulting and salaried work and I really didn’t want to do it. So for me, then I said, “all right, I want to make a little more money, but I really want to lock this in”. And so I built HitTail. It was doing 20 to, it was about $30,000 a month actually at its peak, but then it had major platformers because it relied on Google and it would just get beat up about every year because it was pulling from an undocumented API. I just felt like at any given time, the rug could be pulled out from under me. And that was a huge source of income and revenue and again, I thought, I don’t want to have to go back to consulting. So that’s why when Drip started taking off, I was like, “this is amazing. I’m making more money than I ever could have imagined”, but I still felt like the rug could be pulled out. There was still platform risk with sending a lot of emails when our IPs got banned and we had customers threatening to leave. I remember thinking at some point, I do want enough money in the bank that it just doesn’t matter. And some people call it fuck you money, I call it sunset money. It’s enough money to be able to just ride off into the sunset. And that at a certain point became the goal as we started talking about selling Drip. So all that said, that’s how I think about money and the moment that the drip sale happened and the money went into the bank account, I do remember a feeling of existential contentment in a way that wasn’t about, ‘oh my God, I’m going to go buy Lamborghini. I’m going to buy a huge house’. It was, “wow, we never have to work again”. And that was quite a realization. And it’s a calm, a deep, deep inner calm that has stayed with me since then, and that was seven years ago now. And so I’ll be honest, that’s how I think about money. I don’t think these days I need more, more, more. I do realize that while we are obviously well off, I see friends of mine, I have friends of mine who fly private. I have friends of mine who fly first class everywhere they go. I have friends of mine who spend a lot of money on things that I think would be foolish for sharing how to spend money on at our level of affluence. So I do sometimes noodle on, I don’t need those things, but I do see the advantages of continuing to grow our net worth. If for no other reason, then to be able to ensure the future of our kids and to be generous. We’re pretty generous people in general and we give away a lot in terms of time and money. So that’s how I think about it. So I think some people would say, yes, your desire for money, coming back to that person who emailed, that your desire for money is wrong. I don’t necessarily agree with that. I think if your drive for money causes you to mistreat other human beings or to ignore your family or to burn your relationships, I think you’re making a very bad choice. But if you’re not doing that and if you have a healthy desire for something, each of us is motivated by different things. In fact, Sherry did a really good talk at MicroConf Europe about micro and macro motivations, and she and I had a long conversation and came up with, I think it was seven different archetypes, motivational archetypes. And for example, one of them was a list checker who likes to have a list and check things off. And then there was the time traveler who lives in the future, and that’s more of what I do. Then there was, I forget what this one was, but it was like the moneymaker. It was someone who’s motivated by money. Then there was the people person, which is they start companies because they love people and building the team and building the company serves that need in them. So I think you might want to give some thought to that. Is this a healthy motivation? I don’t think wanting to make more money, if you were doing it from a place of challenge and motivation and you do feel like you’ll put that money to good use or invest in the stock market and be more generous or not, you buy something with it. If it’s a healthy motivation, I have a tough time telling someone that they’re “wrong” to desire this. If you find it being unhealthy though, right? If it’s really grinding on you, if it’s really stressing you out, if it’s burning relationships, if you find that you’re making bad decisions because of it, that’s a problem. And that’s where personally I would tell you what I would do if I had those feelings and those thoughts, I would talk to a therapist or a friend or an advisor or whatever. But for me, I’ve had different therapists over the years and that’s something that I would dig into. Therapy is just a conversation, right? You’re just talking through with someone who knows how humans work and has some thoughts and ideas about how you can get better at thinking. And so I would be working through that with an unbiased third party in essence. So thanks for that question. Frankly, it was a longer answer than I thought I would have, but it turns out when you think about money and motivation, there’s a lot more to it than you might expect. Next question is sales funnel focused and it is a video question.  Speaker 2:Hi Rob. This is Zalia from France. I read in your playbook that most of the time in your sales funnel you put the fact to ask the email of a potential customer before actually performing a demo, and I was wondering if there is a specific reason for that. Because in my case, I was trying to lead first my potential customer or people interested to a YouTube video in which I present my product and I also performing a demo and only in the comment section of this video to put a link in which potential and interested people can send me their email. So what do you think about this? Is it a fine way to do or is there a reason to do another way? Thanks a lot.  Rob Walling:Yeah, so this is a good question. So there’s a couple schools of thought here, right? In my book, what I talked about was if someone comes along to request a demo, I want to route them to the appropriate demo based on how much they’re going to be able to pay me or how much they will be paying me. I’m not going to do a demo for someone paying me $49 a month unless it’s really early on in the app, and I’m trying to learn. If someone is going to pay me, let’s say $250 or $500 a month, and I’m willing to do a one call close at that point. And so that’s what I was talking about in the SaaS playbook where someone enters how many email subscribers they had, because this was for Drip, and that would instantly tell me how much that they were likely to pay me if they migrated to Drip. And if they were going to pay me a lot of money, then they went straight to our Calendly, which these days would be a SavvyCal link and they could get on our calendar for a demo. But if they were only going to pay us $49 or $99 a month, they were instantly routed to a video demo. We did not gate that with an email form. We didn’t force someone to give us their email address in order to watch the video demo. And I will say, you mentioned putting it on YouTube. I hate YouTube for this purpose. I love YouTube for marketing. I hate YouTube for internal company stuff like this because YouTube, the interface is so cluttered. There’s all these suggested videos, there’s distractions and there’s ads. So I would look at a platform like Vimeo, which is inexpensive. Or Wistia, which is designed for this type of thing, but it’s more expensive. Or any, I mean, there’s Sprout video, there’s a bunch of platforms like this that allow you to self-host and not have to deal with the crappy interface of YouTube. That was a side comment. But in a perfect world, yes, you would absolutely get the email address of prospects before a demo, during a demo because then you can stay in touch with them. The idea is once someone books a demo, you should have their email because they get a calendar invite. Before they watch a video demo, it’s kind of up to you. I never wanted to put friction in front of watching a sales demo, essentially a 9-minute or a 10-minute commercial for our product. I kind of wanted whoever wanted to watch that to watch it, and we would embed the video demo on the page and then we had calls to action on that page to sign up for a trial. Your approach of putting them in a YouTube video and then in the comments section to put a link where people can send you their email sounds convoluted. I’ve never heard of anyone doing it. It sounds like kind of a lot to ask someone to do. I would either hack together a quick page, whether it’s in your CMS or your marketing website or whatever, and just embed a video and then you can have an opt-in form there, or you can have a signup for a trial. Whatever your call to action is for the video demo, that’s what I’d be looking to guide them to as a next step. So thanks for the question, Xavier. I hope that was helpful. The next question is from Tamon and they ask, “Hey Rob, I’m writing to ask you a question that I think you might have insight into. I’ve co-founded a company with my friend. We’re both developers and we’ve built paid apps for Slack. We’ve got some early traction, but we can’t seem to get past $4,000 MRR. We’ve tried many marketing things, but none really worked. After four years”. Yeah, it’s a long time. “We kind of want to give up. We know how to build products, we don’t know how to sell them. Do you think it is in any way possible to outsource marketing / sales? Everyone’s saying development can be outsourced”, which it can be “and that you don’t need to know how to code to build a startup, but does it work the other way too? I’m glad to hear your thoughts”. So kind of, not really in this early stage would’ve a very, very difficult time advising you to outsource marketing sales. Founders need to learn marketing or sales depending on if their tool is one that’s going to be sold via marketing or via sales almost without exception. In fact, when I look at the fastest growing companies in TinySeed, if I were to take out of 131 investments and we’re about to do another, I don’t know 20 or 25, so I have to update my numbers, it’ll be north of 150 soon. But all that said, if I were to take the top 10 say fastest growing TinySeed companies, without exception all 10 of those, the founders either head up the marketing or sales or they learned enough to get them to the point where they could hire someone really good and they had one or two or three proven marketing approaches by that time that were working reasonably well. Such that a new hire didn’t have to do that founder level thinking of which marketing purchase should we try. And if nothing’s working now, how do you expect to hire someone to figure that out when they’re not a founder? I really don’t think this is a viable option in most cases. In all honesty, what you’ve built sounds like an amazing step one business, stair step method. You built an app on a platform and it probably gets all of its traffic from one source, which is the Slack app store if I were to guess, and you just can’t get your collection past $4,000. That sounds almost exactly like what I did with DotNetInvoice back in the day. It sounds very similar to when I see people doing it with Shopify apps and Heroku apps, unless some people make it past it, but at a certain point you naturally plateau. And then adding more marketing to this kind of app, which is usually pretty low-priced, my guess is these Slack apps you’re charging $10, $20, $30 a month, and at that low price point, you don’t have any budget to do any marketing approaches that work. I mean, you can do SEO and content and affiliate marketing. There’s a handful that are cheap enough and I talk about them in the SaaS playbook, which ones are cheap enough that you can do at these very low price points. But it’s like four approaches, five approaches tops out of 20. So when your average contract value is this low or average monthly revenue per customers is this low, you don’t have a ton of options to work with. So what I would do is I would either look to just sell these and get the cash and move on to bigger and better things, or I would keep building or acquiring more of these until I had bought out all of my time, this is step two of the stair step approach, and get it to $6,000, $8,000, $10,000 a month MRR. Then I quit my day job. Now I have all my time to myself and I’m able to then build what I want. And for me, the next step of course is standalone SaaS. That may or may not be the direction you want to head. But yeah, after four years wanting to give up, I understand that I would feel similar. I will say that you’ve built an asset, I don’t know how many apps are involved and how complicated it is, but let’s just say for the sake of argument, you’ve built one Slack app to $4,000 MRR. So on an annual basis, that’s $48,000 MRR, and let’s just say for easy math that you have $8,000 a year in expenses. So your seller discretionary earnings or SDE, which is kind of like net profit is $40,000. You should be able to sell that for four to five times so 140 to $200,000, maybe six times 240,000. The issue with six times I think is that you have platform risk because you are on Slack. But man, you’re so small, platform risk should be less of an issue. But you get the idea, I’m just ball parking here, don’t take these numbers for gospel. But if you talk to a quiet light brokerage or [inaudible 00:23:28] International or acquire.com, one of these either brokers or marketplaces, you can get a decent amount of money for it. And that is a luxury we have these days is that SaaS multiples are good enough that it makes even singles, base hits like this, potentially worthwhile. So thanks for that question Tamon. May not be the answer that you wanted to hear about not being able to outsource marketing, but those are my honest thoughts. My next question is about how do I know how good my technical co-founder is?  Speaker 3:Hey Rob, first of all, I want to say thank you. I absolutely love the podcast and it’s been so helpful on my entrepreneurial journey. So please, please keep it up. Here’s my question. I’m asking it partially because I’m looking for an answer, but also because I think it would just be interesting to see your response and I think it would be helpful to other podcast listeners. So my question is how as a non-technical co-founder do you recommend evaluating the performance of your technical co-founder and understanding what good looks like? I’m developing a SaaS app and I have a technical co-founder who seems really good and I definitely trust him and he’s accomplished in his career, but I just find myself as a inpatient, non-technical co-founder, always trying to get it done faster and not knowing what good looks like and what is reasonable to ask for. So I’m wondering if this problem resonates and if you’ve seen it before, and if you have any hyper tactical or specific insights or ways that you would recommend evaluating the performance and understanding really what good looks like. Yeah, that is my question. I am looking forward to your response. Please keep up the great work. I love the podcast and will keep sharing it with all my entrepreneurial friends. Have a good one.  Rob Walling:I think about this on a few levels. As someone writing the code for your product, there’s speed of shipping code. Then of course there’s code quality and the stability and scalability of that code, the ability to modify it in the future. And then there are the soft skills. The interpersonal communication, does he hit deadlines that he says he’s going to? Does he communicate those properly and all that. Soft skills, I’m going to leave it to you. You guys are in communication. I’m going to assume that you can evaluate those. Speed is tricky because you might say, “oh, we’re moving slowly”, but in fact he’s building something that’s very difficult. We are building it very well, and so the only way I know to evaluate speed is to have another person look at it and estimate it of this is the code base or we’re writing in this language with these frameworks and this is the feature we’re trying to build and have someone weigh in on, oh, that should be a week’s worth of effort or that should be a month. And it doesn’t have to be exact. Someone’s not going to tell you, “oh, it’s 12.5 hours”, but they might tell you “in my app, I could do that in about half a week”, or “I could do it in a week” or “I could do it in three weeks”. And so you can get an outside perspective without talking to your co-founder on that one. If you know of a super senior Dev who has estimated a lot of things in their life, you could just have this conversation and show these are some things that we’re trying to build. Here’s the problem though, or I say something I would caution you in. Is oftentimes if someone’s really good, they might be a little slower and you might need to put up with that to have high code quality with high maintainability, and that’s just something that you have to do as a trade-off. I have 100% made that trade-off in certain instances. I remember being feeling stressed in the early, early, early days of Drip that we aren’t moving fast enough, but I knew Derek was a baller developer, but I knew he also wrote really maintainable high quality, scalable code. And so if it took an extra few days or an extra few weeks on a larger project to ship something, I was willing to live with that because I wanted long-term to have a code base in a company that would scale. Unlike some companies that we see where you get this non-technical founder who hires a Dev or has kind of a minority technical co-founder, and they drive them and push them to write code faster and faster and faster, and the code is shit, and then they get to a million, 3 million, 5 million in ARR and they stop, they lock up. You can’t build features because nothing is maintainable. You can’t add new things because you break old things. There’s no unit test, there’s just low quality code. So that’s the thing you have to be careful with is if the code is super high quality and really, well let’s say maintainable, it’s modular, that takes time. And so I think that’s a hard thing to evaluate. Code quality, you could have someone just review his code, whether it would be weird for you to be like, “I’m going to have an outside person review your code”. But you could have someone look at it and not tell him. That feels a little weird to me if you’re checking up on your co-founder, but you have to use your judgment on that and realizing that different people have different measures of quality. And scalability and long-term maintainability, you kind of won’t know. You won’t know for years feasibly. That’s the problem that we see with some folks who are non-technical founders and they hire out their development to an agency or to a freelancer. Nothing breaks, nothing’s bad for the first six months and then at 12 months, 18 months in, it’s like, “why are there’s so many bugs?” It’s because the code quality was shit. But you just don’t notice it in the early days because you go back and you fix those, but eventually you hit the point where quality just grinds to a halt and it will grind your whole business to a halt. So realistically, no easy answers here, but soft skills, you should be able to evaluate. Speed, I think a third party, if you’re particularly worried about that, I think talking to someone and saying, “how long would it take you to build this in Python or in Ruby?” And obviously you can go to Clarity.fm. You could hire someone on Upwork as someone who’s $150, $200 an hour and use them as an outside consultant. Again, whether you talk to your co-founder, it would feel weird to be like, “Hey, I’m checking up on you”. But whether you talk to them or whether you just go straight to a source or if you’re in MicroConf Connect, there’s a bunch of developers. And you work your network at a MicroConf in person event or whatever, kind of sanity check and take things with a grain of salt, I think you can get a reasonable approximation that might help you sleep better at night. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. My next question is from Steven Davis, longtime listener of the pod, and he has written in before. And this is from March of this year, so about seven months ago. “I know you’ve covered no-code several times, and I know you’re a vigorous champion of SaaS, but if you are a SaaS builder, what about self-hosted no-code tools? I’ve been looking at some of the tools in the Linode marketplace. I kind of stumbled into this recently. To me, these offer an interesting trade-off between roll your own and SaaS, no-code offerings. Easier to customize, easier to scale, lots of caveats, but the price hikes and performance of SaaS, no-code can be challenging and you code what you need to and nothing else. WordPress is the grandfather of this, but there seems to be a growing set of options. Sendy is a proprietary but self-hosted email tool. There is the self-hosted Reddit forum, but they aren’t looking at this from a business perspective. Lots of them are open source, so you have to be careful about licensing and maintenance risks if it is closed source. You can look up open source Airtable or notion that they aren’t as polished, but they are on your machines”. Such an interesting suggestion from Steven, and I think Steven is particularly looking to get around the platform risk that you face when you build on Airtable or Notion or with Zapier. It’s really hard to migrate off of them. I think the biggest concern I would have is the same concern I have with Basecamp’s new offering, or I guess it’s 37signals offering Once. Once.com where they say you pay once and you host it yourself. I used to do that 20 years ago and it sucked. I hated hosting my own stuff. I hated, the updates would break things like WordPress is a grandfather of this. I actually wish I was not on WordPress. But I have, what do we have, two websites on WordPress? One is this podcast website because it still is the best platform in my opinion to host podcasts. The other one is robwalling.com, and there’s reasons that those are still on WordPress. But I’m twice a month I’m getting emails of this WordPress plugin that you have has a virus in it, and so you need to update it immediately. So then we have to do a staging environment and then we have to update it and then we have to test and hope nothing breaks and it’s a maintenance headache that I wish I didn’t have. And in fact, that’s why all of our other websites, like you go to tinyseed.com, microconf.com, you go to startsmall.com, saasplaybook.com, sherrywelling.com, zenfounder.com. Those are all on Squarespace. Do I think Squarespace is God’s gift to website builders? No. But do I ever get an email that one of my plugins is out of date or that the theme is broken or they’re doing an upgrade to my SQL and I need to go get my Gemini theme update? No, I don’t have to deal with it. So for me these days, and it has been for probably the fact… Because I used to tinker with this stuff, probably about the past, I made the switch about 15 years ago to where… I mean I used to have a server in my closet that served our source control and we used Vault or what was Microsoft’s one back then? Oh, I can’t even remember the name of it. But SourceGear had Vault and I would serve it off of that server, right? That’s like 20 years ago, it’s just crazy town. And I hated doing that. I hated having to worry about all that. So I see the appeal of hosting your own no code, it’s easier to customize, it’s easier to scale, you code what you need, exactly what you said, and you don’t have the platform risk, right, because you have the code. My concern is these days, I’m not in the business of maintaining custom code for this purpose. It’s a black box and I just want it to work. Look, if I was building a SaaS company, I wouldn’t want to build an Airtable or Notion as my Wiki. I wouldn’t want to maintain my own. The only custom code I want to maintain is my actual product. I don’t even want to build my own knowledge base. I don’t want to build, there’s a bunch of ancillary things around building a SaaS product, and there’s a reason there are SaaS offerings for those because it takes all of the security and the maintenance and the feature development and other things away from you. But of course with that, there are trade-offs. You pay the subscription, and you have this platform risk that they could screw you, they could raise prices, they could feasibly go out of business. There’s all these things, these problems, with SaaS as a model. But going back to pre SaaS and imagining installing and maintaining, I didn’t even get into maintaining the OS on the servers and having to keep that upgraded. I mean, I guess if I was on a shared hosting account or like a VPS or something that was maintained by them, that’s a hosting provider, that’d be fine. But anyways, so it is definitely an interesting idea, Steven, and I have not heard of this prior to you mentioning it, so I appreciate you bringing it up on the show. But for me, my vote would be a no because I just want all of that taken care of. As a reminder, head to stateofindiesaas.com. Take about 10 minutes and please complete that survey so we can put together an incredible report for you and be entered to potentially win a free ticket to MicroConf US 2024 in Atlanta.

Here’s an example of this person who did just that, and I’m going to teach you how to do that,” when in fact that’s bull (beep), when in fact it’s survivor bias, when in fact that’s one person out of 100 who each launched five products, and this one person got lucky and so it’s not repeatable, and I (beep) hated that stuff when I was coming up. It’s another episode of Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m Rob Walling, and today I’m talking about seven things you should never do. And I want to caveat this with, it’s for the most part you should never do. I use never in the title as a way, of course, to get you intrigued. But I’m not the person who puts never in all caps on social media and says things like, “In your designs, you should never have buttons with rounded corners because I say so and you never should.” We used to get these comments when we were building Drip. It was just insane, the confidence with which people would proclaim their opinion as fact. So I’m not going to do that here today. I use never kind of tongue in cheek. I think it’s for the most part, you shouldn’t do it. It’s a best practice. It’s probably 95% of the time you shouldn’t do these things. And some of these are things you’ve heard me talk about before, like bootstrapping a two-sided marketplace, or going B2C instead of B2B. This entire episode was inspired by a listener voicemail that I’ll play in just a minute. But before we listen to that, on this very podcast, we’ve talked about how in the US, Section 174 is really destroying our ability for software companies to write off expenses for software development, and instead having to depreciate that over many years. If you’ve just finished your taxes this fall, you probably saw them go way up with a lot more paperwork, and Section 174 is really the culprit. And previously, you may have been a signer or at least heard about the former letter that our broader MicroConf and Twitter community sent to Congress in April on this issue. Well now, several business groups, everyone from the small software crowd, to biotech startups, to big companies like Boeing are coming together on a new formal letter to Congress. So I’d encourage you if you want to get this fixed before the end of the year, which I think all of us in the software space should be worried about, go to ssballiance.org for the link to the new letter. Even if you already signed the one in April, this is the next phase, and I’d encourage you to check it out. An important note, this is for us headquartered companies, but you do not need to physically be in the US or be a US citizen to sign. So really, it’s US domiciled entities. The deadline is tomorrow, Wednesday, November 1st. So if you’re hearing this podcast before, then head to ssballiance.org. Before we dive into the episode, I want to invite you to MicroConf Remote. MicroConf Remote is our virtual event that we host twice a year. This next one is focused on early stage marketing. It’s on November 1st and 2nd. If you’re interested, head to microconf.com/remote. It’s a very inexpensive event, and talks will include the bootstrap startup marketing checklist, when early stage SaaS companies should hire a copywriter, and how to hire one that doesn’t suck. Building a sustainable customer acquisition funnel, SaaS email marketing, plus our patented Founder x Founder speed networking to get you introduced and connected with other founders in our community. Again, that’s November 1st and 2nd of 2023. Microconf.com/remote if you’re interested. Even if you can’t make it, if you buy a ticket, you will get the videos after the event. Hope to see you there. So let’s dive into the meat of the episode, and I want to kick us off by listening to the voicemail that Dan from Austin sent in.  Dan:Hey Rob, it’s Dan from Austin, Texas. I’m listening to the September 19th episode, which is great, and there was a couple comments that really got me intrigued. You said don’t start a B2C software company, and you also said, “Hey, don’t start a two-sided marketplace,” with a few caveats for both. But I’ve heard you make these arguments before, but as you said those things with such confidence, I was nodding my head and I thought, “Man, I’d really love to hear some more things like that.” What are five other things that you think for the most part, founders just should not do based on all your experience? And if you had, I don’t know, some stories or some anecdotes about those things or arguments, I think that would make for a really entertaining episode. So I thought I’d toss it out there and just say thanks for the pod. We appreciate it.  Rob Walling:Mark your calendars. I think Halloween 2023 is the day this podcast went big time. Because if you recognize the voice of that voicemail, it was friend of the pod Dan Andrews who runs the Tropical MBA Podcast with Ian Schoen. I appreciate Dan writing in with this great episode idea. I’ll admit, prior to this, I haven’t sat down and tried to think of a bunch of things you shouldn’t do, but they just come up when I get questions, or I see something a founder is doing and think that’s an anti-pattern in my mind. So in software engineering, there are design patterns that help you architect things and are general best practices, and then an anti-pattern or a dark pattern is something that you shouldn’t do, right? These are things, anti-patterns against what we would recommend. And so I think these seven things that for the most part you should never do fall in that category of anti-pattern. I did pull a couple from my book. I remember I had a section in there about mistakes that founders often make, so there’s a couple in here from that. And then there’s a couple others that I thought of as I was outlining this episode. So I’m going to skip one that Dan called out, which is the two-sided marketplace. I feel like I’ve railed on that so much over the years. You know the reason I have? Is because so many people write in, or apply to TinySeed, or email me, or DM me and say, “I have this idea and it is,” insert name of the next two-sided marketplace here. And I’m always like, “Great, how much funding are you raising?” “I’m going to bootstrap it.” Don’t bootstrap a two-sided marketplace unless you already have one of the sides. This is Rob’s rule of two-sided marketplaces, we’ll call it. I’m going to stop there. I always get carried away with this. And I’m no longer answering questions about two-sided marketplace. If you want to do that, find two-sided marketplaces for the rest of us. It’s a new podcast, I’m sure we’ll spring up. It’s just one of those things that talking about them is I think not helpful to the rest of the people who are bootstrapping, who are stair stepping, who are starting SaaS companies, info products, and all that. So with that, I’m going to move to number two of the seven, which is starting a B2C application. And again, I jokingly say tongue in cheek say never. Not that you never should. Obviously there are B2C applications that work, but what are the downsides of B2C? Well, it’s low price point, it’s high churn, it’s high support demand, and it’s high and entitlement and less technical users. And all of that for the ability to charge someone $7 a month, or $50 a year, or $30 a year in a lot of cases. When you go B2C, you get the worst of all the worlds, and you don’t get enough money to be able to do any marketing other than free marketing. It has to be viral, it has to be content/SEO, or it has to rank in an app store, which I include as SEO. B2C apps are very, very difficult to actively grow like you can with B2B, because with B2B, the prices are higher. And what’s the second order effect of a price being higher? You can afford more marketing approaches. I covered this in my MicroConf talk about pricing. I covered this in the pricing chapter of the SaaS playbook. I have owned multiple B2C products, some of which were eBooks, and some of which were software. And it quickly became obvious to me this was not the path I wanted to go down. And what was funny is that the very first MicroConf in 2011, I talked about this, about how bad it was… I’d never heard anyone say, “Don’t start B2C apps.” And I talked about it in my talk. That very same event, I think it was the next day, Patrick McKenzie, patio11 was talking about how B2C is tough and was talking about all the struggles he was having with Bingo Card Creator. And it quickly became a pattern of, “I think B2C is probably not a great choice.” Look, if you want to build something fun, little tool, utility to 1,000 to 5,000 and deal with the high churn, it’s fine. Do it. Again, it’s not never, it’s for the most part you should never. And can you do a fun experiment? Can you scratch your own itch? Can you solve your own problem and then go and want to just share that with the broader world? Of course you can. I wouldn’t say… Do stuff that’s fun, right? If it’s a hobby or you’re doing it for a lark, you go do that. I want to close this section out with a story from a friend of mine who had an iOS app. And I don’t even remember what it was honestly. It was like a B2C, some type of calculator or something that consumers downloaded, and he would frequently get people who would threaten him and say, “Add this feature or I’ll give you a one star review in the iOS App Store.” Or he had reviews he would screenshot and send to me. I believe his app was 3.99, let’s say, $3.99. And it would be a two star review and it said, “Would be worth it if it was 1.99.” And I remember I was just like, “Sir, this screenshot embodies everything that I think about building B2C apps.” So the third thing that you should for the most part never do is build a second product because your first one has stopped growing. I’m going to point you to an entire 50-minute episode of this podcast. It was four episodes ago, episode 681. I had our very own Ruben Gamez on the show, and we ran through… This is actually the show that inspired Dan to send the voicemail. But we ran through the pros, the cons, which there are a lot of, and really the mistake or the myth of the second product. That’s what we were trying to touch on is there is often this grass is greener mentality that, “If I just had a second product, then it would do this,” or, “It’s the same code base, I could just fork it off, and I don’t think about the hundreds and hundreds of hours I’ve spent building the domain authority and doing all the other things I’ve spent doing it.” So I’m not going to belabor the second product here. You can go back and listen to 681 again if you want to be refreshed, but that is the third thing that I think you should never do. Number four is one that I tried to do myself unsuccessfully. And this is one, you should never do it if you’re bootstrapping really. And again, you should almost never do it if you’re bootstrapping. Have I seen one out of 1,000 work? Probably, but these are my rules of thumb. And it’s create a category. So this is where you go out and define a new category of software, where you are trying to be so clever and be novel such that you have no competition, and you build out the space, you create the demand. If you’re familiar with the five stages of customer awareness, when you create a category, everyone is unaware or maybe problem aware if you’re lucky. So the education that you have to bring… And if you haven’t seen the five stages, just Google an image, but it’s in order from least aware to most aware is unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware. And so when you create a category, you are in the top two of those. It’s unaware. And maybe if you’re lucky, problem aware. So to get people to be aware that there’s a solution, no one’s searching for that solution. To get people to be aware that there are products that do it when no one’s searching for those products, it’s a tremendous amount of effort, skill, expertise, time, and money to do this. So should you never create a category? No. So I tried to do this with Drip actually in the early days. I didn’t want to build another ESP. I felt like it was super crowded. That’s email service provider. So I didn’t want to build a MailChimp, or a Constant Contact, or an active campaign, just felt like it was too crowded. And so I tried to be really clever. And instead of just saying, “We are email marketing,” or, “We are marketing automation,” our headline described what the product did. And I don’t honestly remember exactly what it was, but it was something like, “We send automated emails at the right time to your customer’s prospects,” and blah, blah, blah, and it was about being clever and automating. But people couldn’t put you in a category. They would think, “So are you like MailChimp? No. I guess that’s email marketing. Are you marketing? But you’re for customers? So are you like customer.io, or are you kind of a CRM thing?” People would be confused. And as a result, I mean we basically plateaued at eight or nine grand. You’ve heard the story, didn’t have product market fit, and eventually I realized we should move ourselves into an existing category of software, and what we should do instead is carve out a corner of that using positioning. And so that’s when the headline changed to lightweight marketing automation that doesn’t suck. So the category is marketing automation. Our positioning is that we were lightweight, and that we were great to use, and we were reasonably priced, and we were on the customer side because we didn’t suck, right? It wasn’t old software. That was the moment where for us, things started taking off. That’s when Drip found product market fit. Now we had to build some features in order to get there, but that was the key so to speak, that unlocked the growth that became Drip. There are exceptions. There are times when you should create a category. Think of what Dharmesh and his co-founders did with HubSpot. This is before the CRM. They created inbound marketing, and they basically created this inbound marketing hub where it was a combination of Google Analytics, and I think it was like a website builder, maybe some lightweight email marketing. But it was this bundled tool. It was a bunch of tools you could get individually, and you and I as developers could comp them together. But if you’re not a developer or you’re not really into MarTech, this was an easy way to get it all in one place. And so they had to define that because it didn’t really exist. People didn’t know what to call it. And so if you go back to the book Inbound Marketing by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, those are the co-founders of HubSpot, and they raised a kajillion dollars to do this, and I talked to Dharmesh about this at one point. He and I were speaking at the same event and I said, “You created a category, congrats. So few people do that. When should you do it and when not?” Or, “What did it cost?” I think was the question I asked. And memory fails, but something to the effect of, “You need $5 million and two to three years.” Maybe he said 10 million in three years or something, but it was more money than I had. It was more time than I wanted to spend. They wrote a book, they started inbound.org, which was like a social news site for inbound marketing. They went all in on defining this term, and Dharmesh had a pretty decent audience at the time, and it was still this massive uphill battle. I think Intercom faced the same thing and then Drift came in. These are the chat widgets. And Drift for a long time, I don’t even remember what category they were trying to create, but they were trying to be different than Intercom. And I think it all kind of is one category in people’s minds now, but Drift raised a kajillion dollars based on David Cancel’s amazing reputation as a five-time entrepreneur, and it still took them years if you watched them grind that out. So creating a category involves not selling in an existing category. It involves, “I’m a builder, I’m a maker. I have this great idea for something brand new that doesn’t have a two word phrase that describes it.” That’s how I think about it. Or maybe it’s I guess an acronym, or a three word phrase like customer relationship management, CRM, email service provider, ESP. When you go beyond that, when you start using four or more words, this is Rob’s completely made up rule of category creation. But when you start needing four or more words or a complete sentence to describe what your product does, you’re in the danger zone in my opinion. Now, someone could give a counter example and say, “Well, what about chat AI, PDF thingy, where you allow me to chat with my PDF? How many of these are out there?” Chat CSV, whatever AI, ChatGPT wrapper people are using these days to allow you to do something? Do those create a category? And my answer is most of those wrappers are a single feature, and so you’re not trying to describe a complex piece of software. You can literally have a headline and it describes everything it does. All it does is allow you to chat with your PDFs. You don’t need a category, because it’s not complex software. But the moment I tell you, “Okay, you have a form, and you’re going to collect email addresses, and they’re going to go into a list. You’re going to be able to send broadcasts and sequences to those people. You’re going to be able to tag them when they buy something or when they do something else. There’s integrations with payment providers and landing page.” You need a category for that, because it’s not just a single feature. I had an app called HitTail, it was an SEO keyword tool, that was the category. But the one sentence description was, “HitTail tells you keywords you’re already ranking for that are low hanging fruit to increase your ranking.” All right, obviously that’s a very long description. I could tighten it up, we could workshop it. I can make it shorter. But you get the idea. It was just that. It was a single feature. So it fit in a category of SEO keyword tools. I could also describe it as that feature, and that’s how I think of these AI wrappers is they are just a single feature. Now the moment your software does two, three, four, five things, you can’t put that in a headline. So what do you do now? That’s where buyers usually need categories to figure out what your software does, and so they can bucket you and compare you against other categories. Here’s the other thing. I’m not talking about five, 10K lifestyle businesses, five 10K a month. I am talking about, how do we build a million dollar or multimillion dollar startup? Much in line with my latest book, The SaaS Playbook, which talks about building a multimillion-dollar startup without venture capital. There are always these niche, tiny exceptions where could I go B2C, or have a second product and try to… I don’t know, create a category wouldn’t be the thing, but be outside of a category maybe is another way to phrase it. And can I get that to 5K, 10K, maybe 20K a month? Or if I have some massive Twitter following, and I do a product hunt launch, and I get a little lucky that I can get it up to 50K a month, these are all possible. They’re very unlikely. They’re not repeatable. They rely a lot on luck. I like to rely on hard work and skill. I like to talk about things that are repeatable, and that through execution you could do over and over and over. And so that’s why I’m talking today about things like creating a category, which is an anti-pattern if you’re bootstrapping because it’s expensive, takes so much time, and for all the reasons I’ve already covered. As a founder your plate is full. So when you have to hire devs, there’s no time to search for that perfect culture-fit, get-things-done developer. Lemon.io’s new product, Lemon Hire saves founders time by connecting them with a pipeline of more than 80,000 senior engineers.

And I mean spoken or written languages, not coding type languages. This one, I see it much less often, I’ll admit, than the others, and this is probably less important. I won’t spend too much time on it. I have seen multiple people, and in fact, there was one app that I bought where at its peak, this SaaS app was doing, think it was six, seven, $8,000 a month, single digit thousands. And yet they had translated the application, all the error messages. I think they even translated the entire marketing website into three or four different languages. And it was such a bizarre use of time and energy. It was kind of like a weird form of procrastination. I think about it like that, where instead of doing what’s actually going to move the needle, instead of doing the thing that makes me uncomfortable, which look, maybe it’s talking to customers. Who’s grinding out another big feature? I’m going to go watch TikTok, and I’m going to watch some YouTube, and I’m going to listen to an audiobook, or I’m going to go on my Trello board and stare at it, or I’m going to go translate my app into multiple languages because I think that’ll move the needle. It really feels like an odd form of procrastination and it’s a huge waste of time, unless you’re at the point where you have tapped out your entire market. So I’m going to use the English-speaking market, or the US market for that matter as an example. If there are tens of thousands of people or businesses that could buy your product, and you’re doing five or 10K MRR and you’ve plateaued, figure out why you’ve actually plateaued. The reason is not that you’ve consumed the entire English-speaking market and you now need Spanish. Even if someone, three people requested we translate it to Spanish. The odds of you being able to translate it well, translate your entire application, just invest the dozens, hundreds of hours to… It’s somewhere, and it’s not hundreds. I mean it depends on how many many English strings you have in there, but to invest the amount of time, the effort, the energy to translate your entire app, and then translate your entire marketing website. And then, are you going to do support in the new language in Spanish? Are you going to translate your knowledge base into Spanish? Are you going to have a separate domain or the same domain? Are you going to market in Spanish? Are you going to do SEO, content, cold outreach, integrations, partnerships, attend events, all the 20 B2B marketing approaches I talk about? When you translate into another language, you spread your focus. In all the conversations I’ve had with every founder I’ve ever advised, invested in, been involved in, anyone who asks my opinion, one founder convinced me that they should translate it, that it was the right time to do it. And I think he was right, and it was a really good conversation. It was similar to the conversation I talked about when we talked about second products in episode 681, where Jordan Gal just had really good reasons. I said, “You know, you’re right. You are the exception right now to my rule of thumb.” And I’ve had one founder be the exception to this translate to other languages rules of thumb. He had tremendous market pull. Parts of his site were already ranking in Latin America. This is an English to Spanish translation. And he had some incredible resources. He already had a support person who was bilingual. It was like everything that I just said, every objection I just talked about, he had an answer to, and he had either thought of it, or he happened to have a good way to do it. And he was running a team of people. He wasn’t at 6K MRR. He was orders of magnitude above that and growing very fast. And the other thing was that he had customers, but his customer’s customers often spoke other languages, even if his direct customers spoke English. So the people buying from him spoke English, and their customer’s customers sometimes did not. And so he was thinking about doing, I think it was like two or three of the most popular languages in the world, and he was getting multiple requests for this, and he was getting some not only inbound, but starting to rank in these other engines. And most of his support, he could still do in English. And I’m only using English as the example because these are the companies I deal with. Obviously, your native tongue would be the English equivalent in this example. The sixth thing that for the most part you shouldn’t do is to treat symptoms instead of finding root causes. I realize this one’s a little meta, but the biggest example I see is churn. Churn is usually a symptom that you have something else wrong in the business. Usually. There comes a time when you’re doing tens of millions a year or maybe a month, and optimizing your churn by having people upgrade to annual plans, or making people give you a reason before they cancel, or offering a discount, or a subscription pause, or other options like that, those will reduce churn. And at a certain point, that makes sense to just do it blanket, and it will lower your churn, make your business better. The problem is I’ve seen founders who are doing, again, they’re early. 5K a month, 1K a month, 20K a month. And they’re churning too high, and so they start implementing these anti churn tactics forcing everyone to go annual, or making that the default, or making you have to call them on the phone to cancel, or just whatever. Putting up some type of friction to get churn down. And what that does is it actually masks the root cause of that churn. That root cause is usually that you don’t have product market fit. You have not built something people want and are willing to pay for, or you have weak product market fit. There’s a bunch of things we could go down in terms of the root cause. But by attacking the symptoms, treating the symptoms, you are doing a disservice to your customers. You’re doing a disservice to yourself because you’re not learning. And to be honest, the reason people do this is because the learning and the figuring out what’s wrong and then fixing is actually really hard. This is a hard part of being a founder. The easy part is let’s build a fun product, come up with an idea, and launch it on Product Hunt, and put it on Hacker News, and tell our friends about it, and get some people in. And boy, it got hard, huh? Everyone’s churning out. Well, guess I’ll move on to my second product. Let’s make this one a, B2C, two-sided marketplace in a new category that I can translate into six languages from the start. Anyways, I’m being facetious here obviously. So this one comes out of me seeing founders, aspiring founders posting on Twitter usually, a conclusion they’ve come to about reducing churn. “Look at this thing I tried. Churn was high, now it’s low.” And usually, I don’t think you’re actually attacking the real problem. Another thing is split testing too early. “I’m going to split test headlines because my conversion rate on my website is low. My visitor to trial,” often it’s like well, maybe the whole website. You just haven’t built something people even want to try out. And that’s the root cause, and it’s hard to figure out what that is. It’s easier to look at a tactic like churn reduction or split testing, and implement that thinking that’s going to save you. But usually, what you’re doing is you’re messing around with a local maxima rather than a global maxima actually jumping up another level, which if you get to the root cause, you can start to attack. This frankly could be a book chapter, multiple podcast episodes, because finding root causes of these things, it’s challenging. But that’s why I do see people treating those symptoms. Maybe it’s a form of procrastination or maybe it’s just a form of not knowing any better. It’s asking the wrong question, right? It’s, how do I reduce churn? Where it’s like I guess that’s the question, but really the quick easy answer is the tactic, “You can try these five things to do it,” but the hard answer is usually digging in, finding the root cause. My seventh thing that I think you shouldn’t do if you want to build a multimillion-dollar startup and bootstrap it, is to launch a bunch of products. And I have quotes in the outline that says, “Hoping one sticks,” end quote. I’m a builder. I love the idea of building 12 products in 12 months, 52 products in 52 weeks. Building and shipping is a dopamine rush. It’s amazing. Getting your new product, or feature, or ChatGPT wrapper or whatever into the hands of people on Product Hunt, and Reddit, and Hacker News, and your friends. And look, I’m not mocking. I know earlier I was joking about Product Hunt and Hacker News launches. Those are a mixed bag, but they’re not a bad thing. If I was launching a product today, I would 100% want to get on these social news websites. I do take them with a grain of salt in terms of actually gathering customers that will stick around, but I do think there’s some value there. It’s probably a topic for another podcast episode. But the idea of launching a bunch of products, hoping one sticks has a couple problems, pretty major problems for me. One is you don’t learn very much. Because if I launch 10 products and one works, it’s unlikely I’m going to know why. It’s really likely I got lucky. And again, I don’t like to teach approaches that need or rely on luck. I’ve been doing this for… I don’t want to sound too old, but let’s say in the neighborhood of two decades. And I’ve been successful at it for less time than that, but I’ve been talking about it on this podcast, my blog, my books and everything for whatever it is 15 years, 17, 18 years. And I’ve always wanted to avoid the lottery ticket approach, the big promise of, “You can be a millionaire tomorrow. Here’s an example of this person who did just that, and I’m going to teach you how to do that,” when in fact that’s bull (beep), when in fact it’s survivor bias, when in fact that’s one person out of 100 who each launched five products, and this one person got lucky, so it’s not repeatable. And I (beep) hated that stuff when I was coming up, when I was trying to become a successful entrepreneur, and I could just smell snake oil. And the further I dug in, the more I found out that the person promoting the approach had gotten lucky, hadn’t really built the business they talked about. And so the idea of learning, and not just being successful, but knowing why you’re successful, and knowing that you could repeat that again, or actually repeating it again showing that you have the skill to do it multiple times. This is something I’ve always held onto pretty tightly. As someone who has been both a doer and a teacher, not just a teacher, not just someone who had a middling success and then claims I started the biggest startup and had the biggest exit anyone’s ever talked about. I’m really sensitive to the people out there who oversell what they’ve actually done. And the folks who oversell what they’ve actually done usually got lucky, and usually don’t know why they’re successful. That’s the problem. So let me tell you some people who are not in this camp, so people who are successful and I think could do it 20 more times if they had the time. Jason Cohen, Heaton Shaw, Rand Fishkin, Ruben Gamez, David Cancel, Dharmesh Shah, I can go on. There’s more than that, right? There’s people in TinySeed who I have a lot of respect for who I know could do this again. And they learned what it took. They had to grind, they had to make mistakes, and then overcome those mistakes and figure out, what is the thought process? What is the approach? What is the troubleshooting? If you never make mistakes, are you smart or are you just lucky? If you make mistakes and overcome them, you learn. You become just a little bit better as a founder. And so that’s the first thing I don’t like about this oping one sticks is I don’t think there is much learning in launching and getting lucky with one out of 10, one out of 20, and then writing that. If that were to be successful, I question if you can ever do that again, if you just caught lightning in a bottle. So the lack of learning and really truly understanding why you’re successful, I think is one thing. The other thing is oftentimes in most cases, I’ve talked to literally thousands of founders now, many of whom are successful and some of whom are not. Most of the time, the thing you initially launch with is not the same product that gets you to product market fit. Most of the time, you launch with something you think the world needs, and you miss the mark. Sometimes by 5%, sometimes by 95%. But great founders then ask the right questions, have hypotheses. They just pivot around. They add a thing, they make a guess, they change their positioning. They don’t just willy-nilly do it, but they learn, and they take those learnings, and they build them into the product, and the positioning, and the marketing, and the sales, and slowly they grind to the point where they’ve built a business that people want and are willing to pay for and are saying, “Shut up and take my money.” Sometimes that process takes months. Sometimes you get lucky. I know there’s someone out there, one in 1,000, who what they launched actually did get them to product market fit. We see those examples on Twitter. Right? We see the examples on Product Hunt or Reddit, and we say, “Oh my gosh, they did it. I can do this too. It’s totally feasible,” and it is totally feasible. One in 100, one in 1,000, whatever. There’s some minuscule number of times where it’s truly what you thought the market needed was what they actually needed. Most of the time, it takes you six months to get there from launch, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months. It takes a long time, and it takes a lot of grinding and there’s a lot of uncertainty. And that, in my opinion, is the worst part of being an entrepreneur, the worst part of starting any company. And let’s specifically say SaaS companies or products that people want, the worst part is the uncertainty when you still don’t know if you’ve built something people want and you’re willing to pay for. And so that’s the part that people want to avoid because it’s painful, but that’s the part that I believe makes you a great founder. Those are the moments, those are the days, weeks, and the (beep) months that you grind it out, and you come out the other side if you find it, if you suddenly see your churn plummet, trial to paid going through the roof, and people searching for your brand name in Google, and you’ve caught the rocket ship, you’re starting to catch what I call escape velocity. Once you’ve made it there, you can look back and be like, “Wow, that was hard and it took a long time, but I’m a much better founder for it, and now I know why I’m successful, and I think I could do this again.” I love having that confidence, right? The repeatability of it. So again, this is the second point. The first one was hoping it sticks doesn’t teach you anything, doesn’t make you a better founder. But the second thing is it’s a disservice to a lot of those ideas, because I think a lot of ideas you launch, and you get the bump, and you get the dopamine rush, and everybody turns out, and you don’t then know how to market. You never make it past the starting line. To me, launching a product is the starting line. People who think about it as a finish line have never built a multimillion dollar product, because really launch is the starting line where you start to learn, you start to learn what you’ve done right, and mostly what you’ve done wrong, and usually you’ve done quite a bit. And that’s where you then gain the skills, right? That’s where you gain the skills of, which marketing approaches do I try, which do I try first? And you actually start doing repeatable things that if they work, will be skills that you take with you for the rest of your life. I think if you’re of the mindset that you should launch and see what sticks, I think you’re probably given up too early. We certainly are doing your product a disservice, because it could be successful with work, with the grind. And I think you’re doing yourself a disservice because you’re never going to learn the nuts and bolts, the blocking and tackling, as Dan Andrews would say, of building a business, and that grind and actually getting there. Look, when I say grind, I don’t mean 70-hour weeks. I just mean doing things that are hard and you kind of don’t want to do. They’re new, they’re uncomfortable, and they’re uncertain, And you might waste time because you might try a marketing approach and it doesn’t work. But then iterating, and building those features, and getting to product market fit is incredibly rewarding. And that’s the process that can take you from being a wantrepreneur, a brand new entrepreneur, to someone who knows how to build great products and great companies. So I hope you enjoyed those seven things you should for the most part, never do, especially if you’re bootstrapping. I really appreciate Dan Andrews writing in with that voicemail. I had a fun time putting these together. Thanks for listening this week. And every week if you keep listening, I’ll keep making these.

This event was held just a couple weeks ago in Lisbon, Portugal, and you’ll hear us give an overview of it, but really dive in to the keynote talks and pull out, I’d say actionable or at least thought-provoking takeaways as well as give our overall thoughts of the event. Before we dive into the episode, I want to invite you to MicroConf Remote. MicroConf Remote is our virtual event that we host twice a year. This next one is focused on early stage marketing. It’s on November 1st and 2nd. If you’re interested, head to microconf.com/remote. It’s a very inexpensive event and talks will include the Bootstrap Startup marketing checklist when Early-stage SaaS companies should hire a copywriter and how to hire one that doesn’t suck, building a sustainable customer acquisition funnel, SaaS email marketing, plus our patented founder by founder Speed Networking to get you introduced and connected with other founders in our community. Again, that’s November 1st and 2nd of 2023, microconf.com/remote if you’re interested, even if you can’t make it, if you buy a ticket, you will get the videos after the event. Hope to see you there. And with that, let’s dive into our conversation. So Dr. Walling, thanks for joining me on the show and for joining me on stage at MicroConf Europe in Lisbon last week. You and I shared the stage and emceed the event for the first time ever.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Co-emcees. We’ve never done that before. We’ve done a lot of professional collaborations, but that was our first co-emcee gig.  Rob Walling:I had a great time. How about you?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, it was pretty fun.  Rob Walling:We had some witty banter.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I don’t think we embarrassed ourselves, which is, you know.  Rob Walling:Unusual.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It’s always positive, in front of 120 people.  Rob Walling:No, but we had-  Dr. Sherry Walling:Strong performance.  Rob Walling:I had an absolute great time. I was thinking before we recorded this that I wanted to say this sentence that’s going to sound like hyperbole, but this is one of the best MicroConf Europe’s we’ve ever hosted without exaggeration. I remember a few landmark years, this is the 10th year, ninth event because we skipped Covid. In certain years you remember as being amazing, as having incredible energy and the attendees all being on the same page and just this positive group energy flowing. And that’s how this year felt.  Dr. Sherry Walling:As the kids say, it had a good vibe.  Rob Walling:Had a good vibe. I was trying to… You asked me, “Why do you think it had that?” And I went through all these reasons and I honestly think one of them is that this is such a small thing, but you could step out of the venue, we’re in the meeting space, we’re focused, and then you took 20 steps and you were basically looking at the ocean, they call it the river right there. I guess technically it is, but I mean it’s this huge body of water and you were in the sun and it was, whatever it is, 78 degrees Fahrenheit outside and it just felt like you could quickly recharge and escape the feeling of say, being at an event and suddenly be outside talking with founders, drinking coffee, having those amazing Portuguese pastries.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, I mean as a psychologist, that’s not a small thing at all. That’s a huge thing to have a little bit of contact with nature, a little bit of sunshine and just a general environment that feels relatively relaxed but also very alive and awake. You don’t feel like you’re just sitting in a room all day getting bombarded with facts and information, but that you’re really present and that when you feel that diminished energy, you can go out and recharge really quickly and easily. And I think that’s why I’ve really loved the MicroConf Europe’s that I’ve attended because you and Xander and the team have done such a nice job of having them in really beautiful places.  Rob Walling:And that’s something that I think is perhaps a little easier in Europe because in the US where we’ve had it, let’s say downtown Denver, downtown Minneapolis, and then Vegas before that, you’re always in the middle of a city and we’re not next to a lake or a body of water, versus where we were in Dubrovnik and now in Lisbon, you’re just right by the body of water. And so I think that’s a factor. Here’s the thing, here’s not the number one factor, it can’t be because that rules out like 99% of venues and there are only so many venues available at certain prices and certain places where people can get to on airplanes. But it definitely is a factor for me, I think  Dr. Sherry Walling:I think one of the benefits of having it in a place like Lisbon is people can combine the attendance at the event with a little mini vacation, which is actually what we did, which we’ve done in different versions over the years with our family mostly. But this is the first time that we have done a little mini vacation, just the two of us attached to a MicroConf Europe event. And I think that’s why you were so relaxed and had a good time is because we had a few days to play first. And again, I think that’s a really nice way to just build in a little bit of play and relaxation and fun, whether you’re a founder going by yourself to an event and you just add a couple days to explore or you’re able to bring your partner or even your family. Taking advantage of events that are hosted in really beautiful spaces, writing off your ticket, just sort of double dipping on your time and energy and travel is a really lovely way to use the event.  Rob Walling:Well, this is not tax advice, we definitely wrote off our airplane ticket. I agree. I mean, you and I had three days together just at the beach and downtown Lisbon and the Commerce Plaza. I won’t embarrass myself and try to pronounce the Portuguese name for it. Going up to the castle, St. George’s Castle. It’s my second time in Lisbon, you’re first, but it was such a nice lead up to relax, even though we both had talks to give. Usually what happens is if we take three days to chill out before it’s like, oh, I got to write my talk, oh, I got to work on my talk. But we didn’t, we had them done enough that we didn’t have to worry about it, so.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So the setting and the context of the event were really lovely. I think just facilitated an openness and a calm and people’s eagerness to just jump in and be present because it was so inviting. It was just such an inviting venue.  Rob Walling:And we changed the format or we continued to lean into the adjustment we started making in 2021, in which we used to do nine talks over two days, and now we do about five talks and with the extra time, it’s all founder connection. We call it founder by founder, where folks have a timer and they meet one another and they have conversations. We had an entire afternoon session that was just outings. You could either do like a walking tour slash scavenger hunt in downtown Lisbon or you could get on speedboats.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I heard the speedboats found a submarine, they were surprised by a submarine .  Rob Walling:Producer Xander really pulled it out on that one to be able to pull a submarine out of the water. But that continues to be from the attendees in the reviews, in the comments that it’s almost like no amount of time connecting founders is too much.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I really celebrate this shift for the MicroConf organization because MicrConf’s always been very focused on strategies and tactics and helping people have the tools that they need to move their businesses forward in the ways that they want to. But when MicroConf started, there wasn’t the sort of barrage of available information that there is now. Now there’s YouTube channels and podcasts and lots of great information for founders about writing marketing company or hiring or any of the kind of technical parts of running and growing a business. And I think the talks at MicroConf are still really valuable. You do a nice job of curating them. But what people are really longing for that they can’t get in other places is that face-to-face connection, is making a new friend, making a new contact, having an experience with someone who has a very similar background, set of values, drive. So I think that emphasis on growing relationships is a really, it’s a value add. It’s one of those things that people don’t maybe see automatically as a value add. But when you walk away from an event, probably the most lasting over the course of your life benefit of being in an event like that is the people that you meet and the network and the friendships.  Rob Walling:If we were to come onto this podcast and say, “MicroConf, it’s all about just coming and meeting people and hanging out.” And there’s a bunch of introverted, I’ll say a lot of engineers who listen to the show, not solely, but a bunch of introverts.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Right, it sounds terrible.  Rob Walling:Right? I don’t want to do that.  Dr. Sherry Walling:I don’t want to do that.  Rob Walling:But I believe people come for the talks and they stay for the community. That’s what keeps people around, because if we just had talks year in, year out with no community, no one would stick around. Speaking of talks and shrinking from say nine talks down to, we’ve done between four and six, and five seems to be the sweet spot. So almost cutting our talk count in half essentially has meant that we don’t necessarily do just tactical talks anymore like, here’s how to write copy, here’s how to do this. It’s so much more about frameworks, things that you can apply to any situation. So higher level thinking than tactics and founder stories. And we usually have one or maybe two founder stories out of five. But the frameworks in this event, I think I was struck by, and there were three right off the top of my head. One was Michelle Hanson who kicked us off, she’s the co-founder of Geocodio, and she had, Frameworks For Making Product and Strategic Company Decisions. And she even talked about having a framework and then overlaying another framework on top of it within, it was the business model canvas and laying, I forget her other framework, the Parker framework maybe, inside the framework. And people were kind of mind blown of like, oh, it doesn’t, you can kind of bastardize these things, combine two of them and just do… Whatever framework you have, just use that one, whatever framework you want, use that one but just be consistent with it, was a big part of her message  Dr. Sherry Walling:Frameworks on frameworks on frameworks. It was very meta level while also being very applicable. And I think she did a nice job of identifying how people are actually using frameworks, they’re just maybe not recognizing it. And so when you pull the curtain back a little bit and do that metacognitive process of thinking about how you’re thinking, then automatically you have the material for a framework. So it was a very helpful talk. And then you were second, you followed that up.  Rob Walling:Which sometimes I’m going in with just a banger talk and I’m like, oh, this is going to crush it. And other times I’m like, I think this is good, but it really depends on how people receive it. And so mine was about the five stages of customer awareness and basically overlaying that over content marketing. And so it was a framework applied to content marketing. Because everyone says, “Do content marketing, create content…” Profit? What happens after that? And at a certain point it clicked with me through some other sources that have talked about it, Powered By Searches talked about it a bit and there’s other people who’ve talked about it, but I had never seen a real deep dive into B2B content marketing through the lens of the five stages of awareness. And the moment that I really believed that the talk was going to resonate is, I got up on stage and I said, “Show of hands.”, Before I said anything, “Who here has heard about the five stages of awareness?” And it was like five people out of 120. And I said, “Ah, this is great.”  Dr. Sherry Walling:Got an idea for you.  Rob Walling:I was concerned it was going to be like 80%, and I was going to be like, okay, well we can kind of skim through that part. Now the money is in this later part of applying it to content marketing, which I’m guessing most people had not doing. But given that they hadn’t heard about the stages, which are unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, and most aware, given that they hadn’t heard of those, it allowed me to almost meta educate on, here’s a concept and a framework you may have never heard of and now I hope to blow your mind by applying that concept-  Dr. Sherry Walling:With some tactics.  Rob Walling:To something you’re already familiar with. Yep, that was the mix.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, your talk was really a really nice representation of MicroConf values because it had that big picture framework thinking, and then lots of screenshots and strategies and practical application and examples, which I think people took a lot away from.  Rob Walling:As well as a picture of me holding our eldest kid, who’s 17 now and off to college, but I was holding him and when he was like, what? Five months old? Reading C# Business Objects book. And then I flashed to today, and I had used that photo at the very first MicroConf that I had spoken at.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Oh, wow.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it was in my talk in 2011. It was a couple years… It was whatever, three, four years old at that point. But the thing I was trying to drive home was, A, this is really what this community is about. We are about business, but we also temper it with what’s really important, which is our relationships and our families. But I wanted to also show of, this is how long we’ve been doing this, that this child in this talk from 2011 is now off to college, and that felt… Talk about representing MicroConf, right?  Dr. Sherry Walling:You put some reps in.  Rob Walling:Yeah. And then day two, well of course there’s a great evening event hangout, happy hour, but day two was kicked off by our very own Einar Vollset who went deep on AI.  Dr. Sherry Walling:He did such a nice job of identifying a real world problem and then taking the audience through the process of how you would use AI in an iterative fashion to work out that problem. And it was a fairly technical problem, so not necessarily something that I was deeply familiar with, but the logic made a lot of sense and he sort of showed in real time how you would query AI, what adjustments you would make to get better results based on the query results from the first round. And I found it to be just a really helpful way of thinking about how to use AI as an asset.  Rob Walling:Yes. Speaking of encapsulating high level thinking with tactics, that’s what that talk was, right? And it was about, to set the stage for those who didn’t see it, it was about essentially categorizing, if you have this huge list of leads that you want to reach out to, you want to contact, how do you get more information about them? And honestly, how do you figure out what your best leads might be, using AI based on shared traits that they might have with existing leads you’ve contacted that have converted. And so it was a ChatGPT demo of, here’s a big list of CSV of my best customers. And then trying to reverse engineer that and say, now here’s a million email addresses or a million companies, how do you find the best ones out of that? So almost like doing lookalike audiences a bit, but I’m not doing it, I don’t think we’re doing it justice, but I mean it was like 30, 35 minute deep dive into that, and it certainly impacted a lot of folks.  Dr. Sherry Walling:People used the mind blown emoji.  Rob Walling:I used the mind blown emoji. I was like, “Whoa, this can do this?”  Dr. Sherry Walling:You weren’t the only one.  Rob Walling:And then we had a Quiet Light, live business valuation, something we’ve never done.  Dr. Sherry Walling:So people submitted their businesses and then Quiet Light did a live back and forth conversation with the founder around all of the important metrics that would be considered in valuation, as well as the person’s motivations for selling or just what, they went through the whole your first phone call to a broker about the potential sale of your business.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and I thought it was super insightful if you’ve never sold a business to know what types of things they value. And the good part was David Newell with Quiet Light would ask the question, then he would get an answer, and then he would just think out loud and say, “Well, here’s how that’s going to affect valuation. Here’s how that’s going to affect the motivation of a buyer. That’s good or that’s not good. That’s going to impact it positively or negatively.” And as you said a little bit about the psychology of it too, and so as he was asking questions, since I’ve sold a few businesses, I was like, “Oh yeah, no, this makes perfect sense.” And then at the end he’s like, “Here’s the range. Here’s about what I think this business is worth.” And that was neat. It was a really nice… And then there was Q\u0026A after that, so it was like a 30 to 40 minute session that I think was probably super helpful for those that have… You don’t sell many businesses in your life, and so if you haven’t done it or you did it poorly the first time, I think this was a nice demonstration of how to think it through.  Dr. Sherry Walling:A real-time case study. And again, that emphasis on frameworks, like how to think about this, what are some strategies that help you think about it?  Rob Walling:And then we had three attendee talks this year, which is where attendees can submit a topic and get up on stage, and these are 12-minute talks, and I wish we could talk about all of them, of course, but I was impacted by Sophie, thisissophie.com, I think is her domain or her business.  Dr. Sherry Walling:This was her first talk on stage.  Rob Walling:That’s why I was so surprised by it, because she just-  Dr. Sherry Walling:She nailed it.  Rob Walling:Crushed it, yep.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Her talk was about how to help your company be known for something very specific. So it was a product marketing talk, but it was again, really a framework for thinking about how to nail the one thing that will be really sticky for your company as far as recognition by your customers.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it was good. She didn’t use the word positioning I don’t think at all in the talk, but that’s really what it was, is like how do you position yourself and anchor yourself in your prospect’s minds, by doing one thing differently and doing one thing really well? It was a pretty good use of 12 minutes.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah.  Rob Walling:In my opinion.  Dr. Sherry Walling:And there was another attendee talk, I know we don’t have time to maybe talk about all of them, but Johannes put up a slide that I thought was the heart of MicroConf. So help me remember the technicality here, but he put up a slide that showed a graph comparing the projected income that he would’ve made from consulting, beginning in I think 2007, something like that. And he looked at his actual income at that time and then projected it forward, and he compared that to the income generated from the business, the app that he started, and of course it was much lower at first, but then there was this inflection point where his income shifted from being from consulting, dollars for hours, to revenue from this app. And it was such a cool just way to look at that shift over time, because for me, that’s sort of the heart of what MicroConf is about, as his income or as his revenue grew with his app, so grew his freedom, so grew his flexibility, so grew his hours spent with his family. And it was a very nice way to tell the story of shifting from something that feels so financially sound and lucrative to this very measured, careful risk over time that eventually also becomes very lucrative. But there’s this middle place of languishing between consulting money and hoping that that app is going to start making enough to cover expenses.  Rob Walling:It’s the common story, is the most common story in the MicroConf space. I have a picture of that slide and I will try to get it into the show notes for this episode. But yeah, it was Johannes Akhison, I don’t know how to pronounce his last name, and there was a third line or bar on that graph, it was exactly what you said, and the third one was all the revenue from the product plus the value of the company now. He started mapping out, I think it’s worth whatever the multiple is, and that put him even further ahead that he has this asset that he’s built, it wasn’t just about income. It really was… He put the slide up and you and I looked at each other and you’re like, “That’s it, that’s MicroConf.” That whole slide out, it was great. And then you took the stage, so we have two talks left. You took the stage, talk about frameworks, holy moly. Motivational archetypes, and you threw out, was it six or seven different archetypes of what motivates us as founders?  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, I think people often think about motivation is just the emotion to get their work done, and it of course is a much deeper, more complicated story than that. It involves our personality, our life history, elements of what we’re coming to this point in our lives with. And so I pulled together a few different archetypes. One is the money maker, of course, somebody who just is after the money, they want the wealth, they want the security that’s what motivates them and drives them. There, of course is the people person, so the person, the founder who’s really motivated to create an extraordinary experience for the humans around them, whether that’s their employees, their customers. So I went through several different archetypes and I think it was a really interesting talk. My hope was to help people think about motivation differently and to give them some material for self-reflection so that they can better understand what motivates them and then what happens when their motivation is stuck or a little bit dried up, how do we reconnect to motivation? It’s much easier to reconnect to it when you understand it very deeply.  Rob Walling:Right, and you coined, I think coined terms, you talked about micro motivation and macro motivation. And micro motivation is the day-to-day, and that’s the cold plunge, Trello board, Pomodoro techniques, get up at 4:00 AM, drink coffee, it’s all the tactics.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Get your butt in the seat, do your work.  Rob Walling:Macro motivation, you were framing as, but how do you stay motivated over the years that it takes to do this? And that’s what you then focused on. But that concept alone between micro and macro, I think most people don’t think about, because you can put things in place to get you in the seat every day, but man, as you burn out, you can’t do the years, you can’t do the reps. And so I think the archetypes that you came up with are something that we should revisit in a book or in a deep podcast episode or something, because there’s something there, and it allowed people in the audience to say, “Oh, I’m part money maker and part time traveler, where I live in the future.” And able to think to themselves, okay, these are my motivations, I need to hang onto those to stay motivated in the longterm.  Dr. Sherry Walling:We also talked a little bit about how motivations change as your company grows, which I think is an important piece of that conversation. It’s not static, it’s really dynamic and it’s an interdependent between who you are and what your company is doing and what your company needs. So yeah, more on that later at some point.  Rob Walling:And then our last talk of MicroConf Europe 2023 was from Steven Craven and he told his founder story, him and his co-founder story, of going from launch, to 50K of MRR in a week. And they had an existing audience… The company’s called Stridus and it’s software for personal trainers. They had an existing audience, but it wasn’t huge. It was like single digit thousand emails and I believe maybe 10,000 Instagram followers, somewhere in that 10 to 15,000. But they just did, they executed on a B to C-ish launch with a B to prosumer audience. Really, right? Because personal trainers, I would not say are straight B2B, they’re more like B to Prosumer. Anyways, they just executed really well, and he told the story of them acquiring the business and then having the audience and building, having this amazing launch week.  Dr. Sherry Walling:It was a great talk. It was very motivational, very inspirational, helped people see what could be possible. It was also kind of a stressful story, which is also very representative of how these big launches go.  Rob Walling:Yeah, he said, he showed a picture of a Porsche 911, and he’s like, I had worked for years, I had an agency and saved and saved to buy that car, and I had to sell it to pay the bills of his company at one point. And it just breaks your heart where it’s like, oh, you could say, oh, poor baby had to sell his nine 11, but he earned that 911, it’s not like his daddy gave it to him, right? He had bought it with his… We know what that feels like to have to make a sacrifice like that. And that’s where MicroConf today, in terms of the content, the talks, focuses a lot on frameworks that can be applied, but also founder stories, and that’s where Steven’s story came in. The other four were about, AR’s was maybe a bit more tactical. And then Michelle, you and I did framework talks that I think are high level and can be applied for years, and I think those frameworks should live on, to be honest.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Tactics, strategies, inspiration in relationship.  Rob Walling:I mean, that’s it. We covered the four, right? The acronym, S-T-I-R, strategies, tactics, inspiration in relationships  Dr. Sherry Walling:STIR?  Rob Walling:I know, It’s like the… It really is. I came to Xander with that at one point.  Dr. Sherry Walling:You might need to work on that a little bit.  Rob Walling:I was like, RITS, SRIT, STIR and he’s like, “Oh.” I was like, “Dude, I feel so bad about having an acronym.” And he’s like, “No, this will actually help us.” He said, even internally, it’ll help the team know what we’re planning events around, so STIR it is. Well, Dr. Walling, really appreciate your time on this early Monday morning.  Dr. Sherry Walling:Yeah, thanks for including me in the MicroConf experience. It was a great event. You and producer Xander and your new team member, Sonia, nailed it. You did great.  Rob Walling:Thanks. Thanks again for emceeing and doing that amazing talk. And these days, if folks want to keep up with you, you’re putting out some great content on YouTube, youtube.com/sherrywalling, and Sherry is spelled like the wine, as well as sherrywalling.com.

A, you’re going to build a bunch of crappy features that are disparate and all over the place. And B, they’re pretty much going to have you replicate whatever competitor they switched over from because that’s the tool they used. If they’re non-technical, they don’t think about innovation and how to improve on it. They just think what got the job done at the prior tool. Welcome back to another episode of Startups for The Rest of Us, I’m Rob Walling. Today I answer listener questions ranging from the value of going to in-person events, trying to get feedback from customers who may be reluctant to give it to you, whether to bring on a partner and more listener questions depending on how much time we have. As a reminder, audio and video questions go to the top of the stack. You can always ask a question by going to startupsfortherestofus.com and clicking ‘ask a question’ in the top nav. Before we dive into the episode, I wanted to let you know about our MicroConf Mastermind program. If you listen to this show, you know that I’ve talked a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my own success, but finding the right founders for your mastermind group can be very hard. Over the past few years, my team at MicroConf has successfully matched more than 1,000 founders into mastermind groups by looking at revenue, team size, strengths, goals, and several other data points to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once you’re matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series, a three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing and more. If you’re looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your company and your success, you can learn more at microconf.com/masterminds. My first three questions of the day are from the same person, Tom.  Speaker 2:Hi Rob. My name is Tom. You’re one of the greatest source of knowledge when it comes to bootstrapping a SaaS. I always listen to your podcast, hear something insightful and apply it to something I’m doing and it brings great returns or teaches me something. I’ve been working on my SaaS in a pretty specific niche in which I have pivoted a couple of times. Previously, I was getting no feedback from my users, so I decided to pivot by going from having a free trial to totally removing that free trial. First question, it is still really hard to get feedback from my customers even though they’re paying. Almost like pulling teeth. It comes in really slowly and it’s all over the place, meaning most features sound like it’s specific to that customer. There’s no common denominator. How should I pick which features to build? Do you think if I increase pricing, I might have a better chance of getting feedback? Maybe the customers don’t know what they want or what is valuable to them unless I just build it for them to see and use.  Rob Walling:Thanks for the kind words Tom, as well as the question. This is an interesting one, it’s certainly something that people face. I have a few thoughts on it. I think that it really, really depends on the space that you’re in or really the customer that you’re serving because if you’re serving product people, software engineers, designers, they will give you feedback. They will have a lot of feedback about how you should re-architect your top nav because it doesn’t make sense to their “expert eye” and tell you things like how you should never have a button with rounded corners or you should ALWAYS have a button with rounded corners. Doesn’t sound like you’re catering to product people. If you’re catering to construction CEOs, lawyers, anyone who is non-technical, insurance agents, they know when they have problems, they’re not going to know the solution and they’re certainly not going to know the way to implement a solution in your product. So I think the way I’d be thinking about this is there’s no way they’re going to tell you what features to build, but what people will say is, “I have this problem and can you add a button to do it” right or “can you add a setting to do it?” And of course you always have to think about, well, is that the right way to solve it? But if you’re not even getting that, and I think your quote was, “it’s like pulling teeth. It comes in really slowly and it’s all over the place”. So this is where in the early days it sounds like you haven’t yet… You either solved everyone’s problem, maybe you don’t need to even write code anymore. Think about that. If churn is low and when people sign up, they convert from trial to paid and you’re solving a problem, why do you need to build any more features? It’s an interesting thing as a builder that we tend to think that adding more features is going to move all the needles in all the directions. Realistically, if you’re not losing deals to competitors and your churn is low, stop building. This reminds me of the SaaS app I owned right before Drip called HitTail. It was mostly a feature. It was an SEO keyword tool that you installed a JavaScript snippet on your website and it looked at where you were already getting traffic from but weren’t quite ranking for, and it made suggestions. It was kind of one feature, these days that would be a feature of Ahrefs or SEMrush or Moz. We just stopped building new features at a certain point. The product itself became mature and that was a luxury because it meant I didn’t have to write code and it meant I didn’t have to hire developers to do it. But the thing is if you’re churn is high, meaning you haven’t yet built something people want and are willing to pay for, or if you are losing deals or customers to competitors. Well that’s a place to look right? Is oh, look around at the competition. You don’t have to copy what they do, but you at least know which problems are they solving. So if you have competitors that do what you do plus three or four different adjacent things, do you start peeling those off? If you have built your own category and you’ve created a category where there is no competition, that’s a challenge and that is why doing so is such a hard road to travel because people can’t bucket you. They don’t instantly look at your software and say, “oh, well you’re an email service provider” or “you’re ACRM” or “you are a cold email tool” or “you’re a thing that I ran my business on” or “a way I build landing pages”. These are categories in each of our heads. If you have gone off and are attempting to create your own category and it’s truly a novel tool and your churn is relatively high and people aren’t telling you what to build, it’s likely you just haven’t solved a problem that people are willing to pay for basically. And I feel like you as the founder, if that’s the case, you have to have some type of vision for what you’re doing and why it’s important. And there’s this balance when we’re building, I know everybody says, talk to your customers, listen to your customers. The problem is if you just listen to your customers and build what they tell you, A, you’re going to build a bunch of crappy features that are disparate and all over the place. And B, they’re pretty much going to have you replicate whatever competitor they switched over from because that’s the tool they used. If they’re non-technical, they don’t think about innovation and how to improve on it. They just think what got the job done at the prior tool. This was a big problem for us in the early days of Drip, people would come over for Mailchimp and all their feature requests were just things that Mailchimp already did. Each of those I had to evaluate, do we build that or do we say no because it was not a foregone conclusion. So this is where founder vision and your kind of own filter of where you think you’re headed in the space needs to come into play. You had a second part of the question, which is do I think if you increase prices, you might have a better chance of getting feedback? I don’t think so. I don’t know. If you can increase prices and you don’t increase churn, then do that whether you get feedback or not because then you’ll make more money. And then as I said in the SaaS playbook, the second order effect is now you have more money to market, you have more marketing approaches available. But I don’t know, I guess you’re thinking raising the price might improve the quality of your customers. I don’t know. I’m struggling with that. I don’t think it’s going to have an impact honestly on people giving you feedback. If you are in fact serving non-technical folks. I think your last sentence of your voicemail was “maybe the customers don’t know what they want or is valuable to them until I just build it for them to see and use”. If they’ve never built a product, if they’re not developers, designers, that’s probably correct. And so what you have to do though is you can’t just make [inaudible 00:08:09] to build. You have to find what is the problem they’re trying to solve? What is the job to be done of your tool? And if you already solved that pretty well, you get to decide, well, do I just add more people to this tool and grow it? Again, HitTail went up to $25,000 or $30,000 a month. It was a great little business. Had high churn for reasons we could go into, but if you don’t have to keep building then don’t. Or if you realize that they are solving other problems with other pieces of software, you could start to add those categories in and build out a bundled product that could essentially save them money if they start canceling other services and they give more money to you and they can cancel these other services. And now for Tom’s second question.  Speaker 2:Next question. I have a customer who wants to become a partner. He is probably the most responsive and engaging of my customers. Initially he wanted 10%, which is the amount I was thinking also for an advisor type of role. However, he wants 40% now for a bigger role. Basically being a product owner doing sales, demos, et cetera. I think the most I’m willing to give him would be 30%. He wants to build this, he says with features specific to him, I’m not sure if I want this. This is what happened with my previous partner who was in this industry that my SaaS is built for and I had to redo a lot of things to make it usable for other customers. Should I bring them in and what should I give and should I give in and give him the 30% or should I just keep building features based on my customer’s feedback even though it’s pretty slow?  Rob Walling:Okay. So there’s no way I can give you advice on what you should do, right? This is your company, this is your equity. And without knowing every detail, I could never venture to say you should do this, but I can tell you based on what you’ve said, how I would think about this. So if someone is going to come on as an advisor and is not going to work on or in the business, usually advisor shares are 0.5% to 1%. I’ve heard of up to, well there are some internet influencer people who are basically affiliate marketers that will take more than that, but even that number getting up, 5% 6% starts to get high. So when you say that he wants 10%, that is a lot of equity in a company and I wouldn’t personally be giving that away unless someone was putting in a lot of time on the business or they were buying in, they were actually putting cash into the business. And so when I think about someone wanting 30% or 40%, there’s a big… It depends. Are you doing $1,000 a month right now, $1,000 MRR? Are you doing $50,000 MRR? Are you doing a million? Because a business is worth is based on your revenue and the growth and a bunch of other factors. And so if you could raise funding right now, not sell. Liquidating a company is always a lower price than what you could raise funding at. So if you can raise funding at let’s say a $5 million valuation, maybe you could liquidate the company today for a million or 2 million, but realizing that the investment in your growth is betting on the future, right? So they’re saying, “we bet that you are going to get there to where you are worth $5 million”. So in this case, if he’s putting in time and/or money, you would probably be thinking about the fundraising valuation. And if you look around at Accelerators for example, they will fund TinySeed, Y-Combinator, Techstars, 500 startups. They’ll fund a company doing a few thousand dollars a month at a $900,000 to $2 million valuation. So like 1 – 2 million, it gets a little lower, little higher, but those are the valuations. So when you think about giving someone 30% of a company, if this has the potential to be a multimillion dollar company, that’s a lot. And so I would want to be very certain that their equity vested over four years with a one-year cliff, so they got zero equity upfront and then it would vest over those four. And I would want for 30% that person’s got to work full-time on the company or as much as I am, I guess if we’re both nights and weekends, then maybe that’s where it is right now. But yeah, you have to be really certain, you’re giving them a 30 year company. This person better be baller and there can be no doubt. They have done what you want them to do in the past successfully, grown companies, done all kinds… Way more experience than just, “oh, I want to do this and I’m willing”. For me, that’s not something I’d be willing to give away that much equity for. Frankly, I don’t know many people that I would be willing to give away that much equity in my company. Again, it depends on, but if he’s willing to put in cash and buy into the business and whether it’s give equity or advice, that kind of changes this and it also changes based on your stage for sure. So it’s a big question and I hope my thoughts were helpful. And now let’s move on to Tom’s third and final question.  Speaker 2:Last question. There’s a trade tool coming out for the industry that our SaaS product serves. My potential partner doesn’t think we should go to it until we think we have achieved product market fit. He thinks we’re 90% of the way there and wants a really polished product before we go. He doesn’t want to preview any potential features we have on our roadmap to potential competitors. I think we should go anyways, not to do sales, but to talk to people and network. What do you think? Again, thank you for your time and everything you do.  Rob Walling:Me, I’d probably go to the trade show. I think learning is so important early on. I am less concerned about competitors and features, unless I have some super crazy innovative thing. If I’m at a trade show, aren’t I going to be able to tell if they’re a competitor or not anyways? Usually you have a badge with a company name, and I should know my competitors, so I would think I just wouldn’t give them the demo. And I don’t know, upcoming features is, roadmap features, is another thing. I mean, I actually used to not give away roadmap features because there were a few players that were basically watching what we were doing and try to replicate it. And so I didn’t want to give them the heads-up. But without that, I’m usually less worried about competitors replicating my features and trying to I guess out innovate me because if you’re the one innovating than they can never get ahead of you. I love the idea of getting into a trade show and talking to real humans and seeing real reactions of real potential customers. Even if you know you’re at 90% product market fit and you have to say, “Hey, we are building this stuff right now that’s going to do X, Y, Z here’s the next couple things”. And that’s what it takes to get them excited. I want to see if they get excited, right? I think there’s a ton of value in face-to-face. As much value as there is in doing Zoom jobs to be done interviews or Zoom mom test interviews, the next highest fidelity beyond that is in person. So I’m a big believer in them. I’ve done a couple of them in my startup journey and they were always fun, exhausting, and I learned a ton. So that is my take. Obviously you have to make your own decision, so thanks for those questions Tom. Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

And you usually have a good nugget of information or something that slaps me upside my head to say, “Hey, keep going”. I have a e-commerce marketplace website that I’ve built, not SaaS but WordPress, and I even gone through the whole process of having somebody build it, didn’t like it, and I went and learned WordPress over the last decade and built it again myself. So I think I’ve added some skills, some hard work into it. And then I sit there and do some videos that go along with my website. It’s called tweetperks.com. And so I felt that I done a good job, but then I listened and you said it’s not luck. This is podcast 671 over the last decade and I’ve done minutia of that in video, and that’s one of my strong points is video. So I need to keep going with it, keep pushing. I see there’s a light at the end of the rainbow there or light at the end of the tunnel, bucket at the end of the rainbow. I’m not sure what’s in the bucket. My goal is to be acquired and then be able to provide for my family and then do some angel investing. I’m at the age where I’m retired from most of my work stuff. But this is something I do and what I’ve been doing for the last 10, 12 years, building this website and enjoying it. But I really need to keep it going. And you on your podcast, keep me energized, give me a nugget, a slap upside the head now and then, and it’s something that I needed. So thanks very much. I appreciate it and keep up the good work and maybe someday I’ll get on your podcast when I’m acquired.  Rob Walling:Thanks for sending that in. Nothing to respond to here other than I really appreciate it and I always love hearing folks getting motivated by the content that I’m putting out. So if you do in fact get acquired at some point, please reach out and we’ll see if it makes sense to bring you on the show. My next question is from Olivier and it’s about thoughts on pre-launch discounts.  Speaker 4:Hi Rob. It’s Olivier from [inaudible 00:18:03] a catalog of embeddable widgets. We have built an MVP for [inaudible 00:18:07] and now I’m focusing on building a pre-launch landing page. Visitor can sign up to our email list by answering one or two questions and then when you’re done, we intend to propose a limited time pre-launch discount. Since it’s my first time building a SaaS product and I don’t have a particular network advantage at the moment, I’m a little bit weirded out by charging our customers in advance. Your new book, the SaaS Playbook, which is incredible by the way, inspired me to do a Kickstarter even though it does not seem to work well with software. Finally, our company is based in Canada, and I was wondering in which currency to charge our customers. Looking forward for your feedback. And keep doing what you do and take care of yourself, the community needs you around for as long as possible.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question. Thanks for the kind words about SaaS Playbook. I’m hearing it is incredible, of course makes my heart sing. If you haven’t left a five star view on Amazon, I would totally appreciate it. I’m trying to get to 100 5 star views. But to answer your first question, it’s about a limited time pre-launch discount and you don’t want to charge customers in advance. Yeah, I never charge customers in advance. I know we have some folks who do pre-sales. There was a debate for a while about should you pre-sell or should you just get pre-commitments? I always got pre-verbal commitments and then I let people try the product. And then I remember the first 10, 20 customers of Drip I said, “I’ll start charging you when you get value out of it”. And the nice part, I was super involved with them, and in terms of onboarding and getting them going. And the cool part was I could then start to realize, oh it does take a couple of weeks to basically try Drip out. To get in, write the emails, add the JavaScript widget, do the whatever else, and that started informing how long our trial should be. So it was actually helpful research for me. So I don’t feel like you need to charge from day one upfront. I do think you need to be pretty mindful about who you let in because you will get some people who will waste your time or who I guess won’t have opinions that will match up. Some people get really opinionated early on that you should take it in a direction. If you’re like, you know what, that’s not where we’re building. Those are the folks you’re looking to have conversations with to figure out which direction are you going to take it because there’s going to be a lot of disparate information, a lot of conflicting information, a lot of noise. And if you let five different customer types in, it’s going to be all over the place. And so trying to focus on one or two ideal customer profiles, or ICPs, I think will be a benefit to you. One other comment is you mentioned having a pre-launch limited time discount. I would tend to maybe not do a discount and to instead say, “what else can I give them to keep the price what the price is?” But say you get complimentary onboarding, you get a free copy of my book, you get one-on-one call with me and someone else to help with strategy sessions. There’s all these things you can add. I just don’t like discounts. I think discounts are, this is going to sound mean when I say it, I think discounts are lazy. I think discounts are easy to knock some money off it, give them a lifetime discount, whatever it is. If you need to do it, you need to do it. I won’t say I’ve never discounted anything. We totally have. Well, here’s an example actually. On my Kickstarter, and then when I was selling my book pre-launch before it was printed, instead of saying, “oh, you just get the book cheaper”. I said, “well, you can buy bundles”. That’s it. I didn’t sell the book individually. So you got, instead of paying let’s say $25 for the hardback or the paperback, instead of discounting that down to $15 or $20, what instead I said is, “oh, if you buy the paperback or the hardback, you also get the audiobook and you pay $30”. So it’s actually an upsell in a way, if you think about it. I got five more dollars and I get to give them a digital copy of the book. That’s the kind of stuff I’m talking about. Now you don’t have to bundle it exactly like that, software is different. But that’s the thinking that I like to go into time… I love time limited deals. I love the time pressure, I love the rewards, but I like to think what more, what else can I give them rather than how do I make my stuff cheaper? And then Olivier’s last question was, well inspired you to do a Kickstarter, which is crazy. I haven’t really heard people do that for software, so I’m curious how that turned out. But you said finally your company’s based in Canada and wondering which currency to charge. I guess it’s where are your customers based, if they’re all Canadian than Canadian dollars? And if there’s going to be a mix, certainly if they’re going to be in the US, you probably want to charge USD. It’s just a stronger currency, so why not take advantage of that? Because we’re used to paying in USD. And then the question is, well, what about my Canadian customers? Do I charge them in USD or Canadian dollars? And that one, I honestly don’t know what I would do. I would prefer to charge everyone in one currency of course. I don’t know how many problems that’s going to cause you until you try to do it. I don’t know how many complaints you’re going to get until you try to do it. Are you going to feel really expensive to Canadian companies or people that are buying this? Maybe. And if that’s the case, then you kind of have to charge two different currencies. But that’s probably something for you to either ask in something like MicroConf Connect, where there are more than 5,000 other bootstrap founders who have thought about exactly this, right? And people who have tried and failed and made mistakes, and get input. I think there’s a pricing channel in there for example, and this could be a good question to ask and get several viewpoints from folks who have tried this and been successful. So thanks for the questions, Olivier. Hope that was helpful. My next question is anonymous and it’s about productized services and pausing.  Speaker 5:Hi Rob and whoever else is on the show this week. I would love to hear you guys’ opinion on productized services and pricing. Recently, I became aware of some designer websites where they’re selling unlimited requests, but they fulfill them one at a time for a subscription fee that they allow their customers to pause, and they’ll track the days. So if you pause on the 15th, you’ll get 16 days remaining when you un pause it until you have to pay the next month. I love this idea because then it lowers the budget required for some companies to hire you. However I’m afraid that if I were to adopt such a policy or a thing, if I were to make a productized service which I’m considering doing, that the income would be very volatile. What are your guys’ opinions or concerns about this? This is my first foray into this kind of work. That’s all I got. Thanks so much.  Rob Walling:Okay, so productized services. If you’re wondering what my thoughts are there, I like productized services. I think they’re a great stepping stone. Nice step two business on your way to creating a standalone SaaS, if that’s where you want to go. My thoughts on pausing are that I wouldn’t start a business that allowed pausing. That just means it’s really a high churn business. It is a business that probably shouldn’t be a subscription in reality, and you’re forcing it into the subscription model. And to adopt a pausing feature really does dilute the benefit of recurring revenue. And you essentially no longer have that if people can just pause it all the time. So should I say no one should ever do that? No. I’m sure it’s a necessity. I’m sure if you build this type of business, it becomes something you want to do because otherwise your churn is 20% a month and that feels painful. But also pausing is churn, if you think about it. If you’re looking at revenue churn, which is what I remember, then the moment someone pauses they’re no longer paying you. And then later on you can either count it as like… This is weird because you basically have a customer, if you count them as a customer, that’s paying you $0. And so it would be churn down to or contraction revenue down to zero, and then expansion up to whatever they’re paying you. That would probably be the technically correct way to do it. I don’t know of any metrics tool that will actually do that correctly, you probably have to finagle around with things. So for me personally, I don’t love it. I would be looking for a business that is more of a true recurring base. One other thought you can think about is doing annual only and then people pay for the whole year. And if they were going to pause it during the year, if they only need it five, six times a year, they just pay the price for the whole year. And that means they don’t have to deposit because when they aren’t getting value, they don’t cancel. And then they come back and it’s just this resource that they have for a full 12 months. And that’s how I would think. It’s not to combat churn per se, but it’s to kind of even out their needs so they don’t feel like they’re getting taken advantage of in the months that they don’t use it. But if you pay for a whole year and you don’t use it for a month here and there, it doesn’t feel the same way. So thanks for that question. Hope it was helpful. My last question of the day is about equity, it’s about advisor equity and anonymous asked, “do you have any episodes on working with fractional CTOs and how much equity to grant? I’m trying to determine this question with a startup in MVP / beta at pre-revenue”. So usually, I mean, this is kind of an advisory role it feels like. Well if they’re fractional CTO, you don’t have to give many equity. And I do wonder why you would do that. Is there a compelling case to do that? Will they not work with you unless you give them equity? Or are they lowering their rate in order to get equity because that’s a good deal for you. And if they’re not, then don’t give them equity. But if you get to the point where you’re going to give them equity, usually I think of it as an advisory portion of shares, which is usually as I said earlier 0.5 to 1%, and it usually vests monthly over two years. I’m saying usually, these are rules of thumb. There is no cliff on these, and that’s how I would think about it. Again, that’s how the rule of thumb works. You can obviously adjust it up or down depending on the value that they bring to the business. So thank you for that question to round out this episode. Hope you’re having a great week this week. Hope this episode maybe sparked something in you as you’ve listened to it, to want to go and market it harder, to build another feature, to onboard another customer, and to keep pushing forward in your own business endeavors. It’s great to be with you this week and every week.

This week I talk with Alex Theuma, the founder of SaaStock. We talk about a myriad of topics around trying to bootstrap an event and how hard that is, the pros and cons of large events versus small startup events. And at the end we share a couple memorable mishaps or war stories from years of running events. I’ve actually wanted to attend a SaaStock for the past few years, and there always seems to be a scheduling issue on my end that has kept me from attending. Just to check it out, a big event with a lot of people, multiple stages to see and experience what I’ve heard a lot of folks talk about. So hopefully this episode of the show brings you some insight, some inspiration, and maybe a little motivation to check out SaaStock in the future. Before we dive into the episode, I wanted to let you know about our MicroConf Mastermind program. If you listen to this show, you know that I’ve talked a lot on this podcast about how important masterminds have been to my own success. But finding the right founders for your mastermind group can be very hard. Over the past few years, my team at MicroConf has successfully matched more than a thousand founders into mastermind groups by looking at revenue, team size, strengths, goals, and several other data points to make sure your peer group is the right fit. Once you’re matched, you’ll also have access to our mentorship series, a three-month program where you can connect with some great minds in sales, business development, marketing, and more. If you’re looking for accountability, honest feedback about your business and the opportunity to make new friends that care about your company and your success, you can learn more at microconf.com/masterminds. Alex, thanks so much for joining me on Startups For the Rest of Us.  Alex Theuma:I am very excited to be here, Rob. Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Absolutely. It’s a long time coming and as folks heard in your intro, you’re the founder of SaaStock, which I think is interesting overlap with MicroConf, or not even overlap, but just we’ve traveled such a similar path in building our events. And this podcast SPR out of a blog that became a, should we all get together in a room? So we started a MicroConf in 2011 in Las Vegas and it seems like from what I know about your story, perhaps you have similar early stages. And for folks listening, we’re going to talk about SaaStock. Really, I like inside baseball. You’re an entrepreneur and a founder, and that’s what this show’s about, is being an entrepreneur and founder. So we’re going to hear stories about things you’ve learned, missteps, even just thinking about bootstrapping a SaaS, we talk a lot about. How the hell do you bootstrap a conference? Just so few of us do it, right? So with all that said, I’d love to hear the early stages, how did you bootstrap a first event and get people to come? Because when you don’t have a brand name, no one will give you the time of day. People are not buying airline tickets and they’re not booking hotels.  Alex Theuma:Yeah, yeah, yeah, good question. Yeah, I think we’ve traveled an almost identical path in building MicroConf and SaaStock, right? So you’re right, it came from a blog. I started a blog called SaaScribe in 2015. The idea there was to create a community driven blog for SaaS founders that are growing their businesses, SaaS companies that are growing their businesses. I thought I identified a gap in the market there and to get some experts and influencers to create some content as I’d never run a SaaS business myself, so I’m not the authority to tell people how to do it. So instead, I recruited people to write content for us without charge. I mean as in I didn’t pay them anything. They did it for the good of SaaS and we get their name out of there and they bought into the why. So we had the blog and three months later it kind of took off a little bit. It resonated, I was getting a lot of emails from people saying, “I like what you’re doing. I’m rooting for you,” this sort of thing. Three months later, I started the podcast, The SaaS Revolution Show, which is happening still eight years later. And then a few months later, then I started doing local meetups, and it was then when I was having the face-to-face conversations that people were saying, “Hey, look, we’d like a bigger thing.” We’ve got 120 people here today in one of the meetups, which was great, and people travel from all over the UK. It’s like, “We’d a big thing in Europe and you seem to be the person that is probably primed to do it.” I was like, “Oh, really?” Yeah, I’m looking for a way to get into this full-time because I was really enjoying it. I had a side hustle… well, that was the side hustle. I had a full-time job, but this was the thing I was trying to explore as to could this help me become the entrepreneur that I finally wanted to become after many years of issuing many ideas. And so that groundwork, I think to your question about how do you bootstrap it and get the credibility and authority. It was from doing the blog posts or running the blog, getting on people’s radar, interviewing founders on the podcast and VCs, that enabled me to have a little bit of authority and credibility. To the point where I think it was in November, maybe a little bit before in 2015, where I met with, I think it was Nick from ChartMogul at the time and their business subscription metrics platform for SaaS businesses. And I had a conversation with him at another conference, I believe it was Web Summit, and said, “Look, people want me to build this SaaS conference in Europe. I’m thinking about doing it.” And he said to me, “Look, if you do it, we will sponsor.” I didn’t forget that. And then I kind of went forward with the project. I was starting to build the website, I found the venue, I found the date. As soon as I had that, I went back to Nick and said, “You said you were going to be my… sponsor this, I’ve got a date venue. It’s happening in the RDS in Dublin.” And he came back and said, “Yep, we’ll do that.” And he put his money where his mouth was and became our first sponsor. Maybe one month later, I closed a deal with Patrick Campbell, who was the main competitor, ProfitWell, of ChartMogul. And effectively from there, we were customer funded bootstraps from that point on. And when we started selling tickets in January, so we waited over the Christmas period, the audience was the people that had come to the meetups that was subscribing to the newsletter, reading the blog, that was listening to the podcast. And so there was an active audience there of people that had wanted and asked for this conference. I think the first day we sold like 37 tickets, and I saw this spike of revenue and I was like, “Great people actually do want this thing.” So that enabled me to have the runway really to I guess build this for the next nine months and pay myself and then eventually start to bring some other people onto the team. But there certainly were a couple of months where it was very close coming to the end of the month where I was running out of money and I was like, “Oh, I’m not going to be able to pay myself next month.” And then suddenly you get a deal in at the end of the month and like, “Phew, stress over, I can feed the family.”  Rob Walling:Right. Well, it seems like you were ahead of us when we started because I didn’t realize that most events, all events need sponsors in order to make them happen. I was under the impression that, “Oh, when people charge a thousand dollars for a ticket or $500 for a ticket, they sell those tickets and that pays for the event.” But no, they’re all subsidized by sponsors and without sponsor subsidy, you have to charge way more. The events are just much more expensive. And so we figured that out the first year and then the second year realized that we’re going to sell sponsors. But you were ahead of that game. It sounds like the sponsor was the first thing. I wonder if that comes from being… because your background is in sales, right? Like enterprise sales?  Alex Theuma:Yeah. Yeah, I think so. When I left sales or selling other people’s software, I was like, “Oh, so glad to see the back of sales. I’m done 11 years of sales, I’m done.” But obviously the first thing that I had to do as an entrepreneur was sales and generate revenue. So I wasn’t quite done, but it was quite different when you’re selling your own product and it’s something that you passionately believe in, and also you had to make it work, right? Because I left my job to go all in on this. Gemma, my partner was six months pregnant or something like that. We had no income in the household, so I had to make it work. So there’s nothing like something like that to give you that drive, a deadline of knowing when you’re going to run out of money. So I got into it and just I guess through the conversations… And I can’t really remember Rob, whether it was a real deliberate strategy, but to go after the sponsors first. But it just so happened that I had that conversation with Nick, which then gave me, I think it was like 12,000 euros or whatever, to then plot on for the next few months. And then again started to get that in, and I think we ended up or I ended up doing about 35 sponsorship deals for the first year. And it was about 50/50 revenue on sponsorship and tickets for the first year.  Rob Walling:That’s incredible. Wow. And there’s this old saying, “Start an event, they said. It’ll be fun, they said.” After we ran the first MicroConf, closing party night, I was telling everyone, “Never doing this again. This is it for us.” For us, it was a side project. We bootstrapped it, we made money on it, made thousands of dollars that first year, but it was definitely not something that I wanted to do again because of how stressful and how much work it was. And I was like, “I cannot justify this.” So then people were like, “No, you have to do it again. This was the best event I’ve been to.” It really resonated with the folks. I mean, our first event was 105 people. It was a very small event. So I’m curious to hear your experience of, for you, after running that first event, were you wide-eyed, like, “Oh my gosh, this was so much more complicated and difficult than I thought it would be.” Or did you go in eyes wide open in the sense of, “Yeah, it’s going to be tough.” And when you came out the other end, you’re like, “Well, we broke even or made some money. That’s a big win and we’re going to do it again next year.”  Alex Theuma:Yeah, good question. It sort of makes me smile because certainly the first event, I was walking around super tight. I didn’t sleep the night before. I think I actually probably had a panic attack the night before. And in largely, I think it was because we did lose a good amount of money, it was about 60,000 pounds, something like that. And I was like, “Okay, well, we’ve lost all the money. I’m aware I’ve lost the money. How am I going to pay that back?” And so I didn’t sleep very well at all. And then I went to the event and then the event was running, so the event was running kind of without me. After I’d done the opening remarks, you’ve got the production company that’s running the event. Everything seemed to be working fine. I’m walking around speaking to people and everybody’s like, “Alex, you look terrible. You look terrible. Are you not having a good time? You look terrible.” Without them knowing the reason that I looked terrible was because I hadn’t slept the night before because I’ve lost this money. But when the event was done, everybody, I remember having a pint of Guinness outside the RDS and speaking to people and just trying to come to the terms with, “Okay, we’ve lost money. We need to figure this out.” And everybody was like, “This is amazing. What’s the plan? Next year double in size, do this, et cetera, and so on.” And I was like, “Well, look, I know one thing for sure is I’m not taking a holiday tomorrow. I need to go back to the sponsors and start selling them on next year again.” And that’s pretty much what I did. So over the next 30 days, I rebooked about a hundred thousand pounds worth of repeat revenue from the sponsors. And then that gave me a little bit of, more peace of mind around how I can pay back some of the loss from this cash in the bank as such, and then just repeat. And that’s what we did. We basically, I put the finger in the air and said, “Let’s double in size next year.” And we almost doubled in size year-on-year. And again, it was just another 12 months of hard work and actually 12 months on one event, you don’t need to do that, right? We’re kind of now more on a six-month cycle per event, but I used to spend 12 months, five tweets a day than doing… you’re kind of doing everything, recruiting the speakers, doing the sales. That’s what you had to do for the first event. Now I’ve got a team of people doing that, so you don’t need to work six months on it.  Rob Walling:Are you tired of searching endlessly for highly skilled software developers, CloudDevs is your solution.

And the couching of this question is most people listening to this podcast are familiar with MicroConf, our flagship event in the US. It’s in Atlanta here in April. It was in Denver last April, and then we have a flagship Europe event. It’s in Lisbon actually in a couple of days as we’re recording this. We are single track, we are 150 in Europe and we peaked at 300 in the US and then COVID, so now we’re at about 250, I think Denver was, and hopefully Atlanta will be that as well. And we have five or six speakers and we have a lot of activities and networking and this and that, two and a half day event. And there are certain pros and cons of that format. The pros, it’s super intimate. There’s a lot of other stuff versus a SaaStock, which I think you were saying it’s several thousand attendees, it’s multiple stages. There’s a bootstrapper stage, there’s a venture stage, a growth stage, whatever, all these different tracks. In your mind, what are the pros and cons of that model, of these contrasting these two models? Because I don’t believe either one is better than the other, but I do wonder as someone who runs a big event and has now for many years, how do you think about that?  Alex Theuma:Yeah, it is a good question. I guess from the very first SaaStock, I did think about how do we grow this? I wanted to have a growth business and not just have the conference that… and there’s nothing wrong with this, but that was kind of the same size doing the same revenue each year. I wanted to think big, but also I think during every single event, and certainly in the early years walk around and people are saying, “This is the perfect size at 700, don’t grow any bigger.” At 1500 they said, “This is the perfect size, don’t grow it any bigger.” And I think they stopped-  Rob Walling:We get that too.  Alex Theuma:Yeah, they stopped-  Rob Walling:We get that at 150.  Alex Theuma:Yeah, they stopped saying that. Well, 150 apparently is the perfect size where people, everybody can connect with each other, right?  Rob Walling:It’s Dunbar’s number [inaudible 00:14:56].  Alex Theuma:Yeah. You certainly sort of lose that at SaaStock, but by design, I’ve always thought, “Okay, as we scale the event, how do we keep the people happy that perhaps smaller events and what do we do there?” So there’s a lot of curation and actually SaaStock, if you deconstructed it, could be many mini events and one big event put together. So on the first day we do this thing called SaaS City, which is a one-day accelerator for your SaaS. I think this year it’s about 10 different workshops with probably 50 to 60 people per workshop. Then we do pub crawls, and then there’s an opening party with about a couple of hundred people. So with the workshop sort of size, there’s nothing really daunting about sitting with 50 of your peers in a day long workshop that’s being led by some of the best experts in the industry. Then at the main event itself, that’s when it gets a little bit more of the scale, but then we look to have all these different stages in terms of content for everybody. So like you said, the bootstrapper stage, that’s a stage for about 150 people. And again for an audience of bootstrappers and generally those that are doing anything from zero to a hundred million. But I would say the majority of our speakers will be under 10 million in revenue and be sharing stories of how they got to 10 million. We’ve got a few, Gregory, I can’t remember his surname, the CEO of MuckRack, they’ve got to 50 million ARR. Great to be able to share those kinds of stories as well. We have an accelerate stage, again, for those that are really just at that really early traction stage. We’ve got the expo, which is obviously a big part of it and the showcase. And then what happens, there’s a bit of an ecosystem that’s grown around SaaStock now. So last year, as far as I knew, there was about 20 different side events that are happening around SaaStock in various parts of Dublin. And that includes actually, and I don’t know necessarily how I feel about it, but I think more positive is that people are running their own events. Well, SaaStock is on to capitalize on the fact that we’ve got the audience there and we’re not getting any financial benefit from that. But actually having more side events, I think, and a bigger growing ecosystem, I think really does add value and gravitas to the event. So there’s con there that we lose a bit of sponsorship revenue potentially and that they’re taking the audience out of our venue. But the pro is I think the more side events, so I believe it kind of helps with the gravitas of the event. But pros and cons in terms of size, well, I think certainly a con, if we start with that. For some people it can be overwhelming and if you maybe be more of an introvert or not a natural kind of networker, perhaps it can be a little bit overwhelming. When you come in and there’s a buzz, there’s the noise, there’s thousands of people, it’s like where do you start? And maybe you start with just watching a bit of content. But we do try to facilitate all these connections through our smaller events and through the networking app and so on, so you can meet the right tribe. We also do lots of dinners, smaller dinners, whether you’re like CMO, CFO,-CEO, sort of dinners, et cetera, to put people together as well to kind of help with that. I think someone like the pros, if you are used to a smaller event and single track, obviously there is much more I think available if you’re looking at a menu, a la carte menu, you can pick and choose what you want and where to go and what talks to see. And even if you’re a bootstrapper, watch a few talks in the bootstrapping stage, but pique your curiosity to look at some of the venture backed companies that have made it to a hundred million and sort of consider. I’ve had a number of conversations with those that are really anti VC over the years, would never take VC money and bootstrap to 30 million in revenue and then finally took VC money. And I don’t know whether they’re happy or not about that, but they did some secondaries and stuff like that. But people do change, and I think SaaStock gives you that optionality to think about that and say, “Well, maybe bootstrapping is right for me now. Maybe we can change in the future and I can speak to VCs, get feedback on the product and so on.” So there’s a few things there, but I think there’s a lot, the main pro is a lot of optionality, and you can just do the small stuff if you just want to do the small stuff. But I would always say spend some time before you go to the event and be prepared. I think if with a 150 person event, you could probably just rock up and ideally almost speak to everybody there and not do too much kind of prep. And with an event SaaStock, try and figure out who you want to meet, what talks you want to see, carve out your own agenda. And that’s the benefit of having all these options that you can create your own agenda and not just the one that we put on.  Rob Walling:And as someone like yourself who is programming these events, I know you have a team doing that. And when I say program, I mean you pick the speakers and you help them figure out what to talk about. And so you are in essence a taste maker, just like being, you have a podcast, you have a blog, you can set the agenda of what a lot of founders here just like this podcast does and MicroConf does. And I’m always pretty deliberate about what do I think people need to learn this year? And sometimes there’s fortuitous like, “Oh, I recently heard about this amazing speaker and whatever they speak about is going to be great.” But oftentimes it’s like, “I think this is a pertinent thing that founders aren’t thinking enough about.” So maybe five years ago or three years ago, it would’ve been like, “People should know enough about Web3.” They don’t want to be sick of it, but I think SaaS founders should know enough. So there should be a talk about that, for example. MicroConf didn’t do that, but AI may be a thing, a topic of today or whatever. I’m curious how you think about that. What do SaaS founders need to know? How do you know what they should maybe be learning at this event?  Alex Theuma:Yeah, yeah, good question. So yes, we do have a team that does that. I still advise, and I still use my position to email and book speakers and do introductions and so on. But effectively in terms of our process, so let’s say after one conference finishes, part of the processes that we get on customer calls and get feedback and what did they like, what didn’t they like. And then there will be a sort of research process in terms of what are the current topics for the year and for the agenda. Ahead we will put a steering committee together or a mixture of VCs, bootstrap founders, some operators, and the person who runs our content program. And David will speak to these folks on a regular basis and say, “Who should be speaking? Who are you following? What topics should we be covering? What are you seeing out there in the market?” And gathering this data and then compiling this data to then give us a list of options of these are the topics, these are the themes. We also survey our attendees post customer research calls to ask them what are their biggest problems that they’re facing? And if we see a commonality in trends, then we say, “Okay, well look, if you’re saying your biggest problem is fundraising, if we put a lot of content on fundraising and solving this problem, hopefully there’s a real compelling reason for you to come to the event, right? Because we’re actually talking about problems that you have and how to solve them as well, right?” So I think it’s these things and then you mentioned AI, for instance. So definitely we’ve got… actually one of the topics is AI, we’ve got workshops on generative AI. I think it just makes sense. It’s certainly one of the buzzy things this year, it’s super topical. We have been to conferences this year, which are similar to ours where AI wasn’t mentioned at all. It’s just the typical, here’s how we got to 200 million stuff, which was still good content, but actually not talking about what’s happening today and in the future and what people need to be considering. So we do need to do that. We haven’t always done that, process hasn’t always been there, but now that’s a little bit of the insight to what it looks like. And just to ensure that we’re not missing any elephants in the room there and just kind of covering the things that people want to hear about.  Rob Walling:Last question as we wrap up. I have some more stories from MicroConfs. I’m not going to mention names, but we have had a bottle of hot sauce thrown at a speaker while they were on stage. We have had a sprinkler go off in the middle, of lights heated it up, it went off in the middle of the event, people running out. I have t-shirts made with these things on them, if you know you know, there are others. We had an MC fall off the back of the stage while she was MCing. We have a great audio of that. I mean all these are crazy scary when they happen, but then they make the stories. Just like growing a SaaS company, you get these stories of the crazy customer, the time Russian hackers invaded your this and that. I’m curious, as we wrap, if you have one or two of those, again, no need to mention names, but just some crazy stories because it’s inevitable I think as you run events like this that those happen.  Alex Theuma:Yeah, yeah. I would say no major disasters that I’m aware of, but one from last year was interesting. I don’t know if it’s a crazy story, but our friend Patrick Campbell, he did a talk where all he said was the word churn for 20 minutes.  Rob Walling:I’ve heard about this.  Alex Theuma:Yeah. And it really divided-  Rob Walling:There were mixed reviews, weren’t there?  Alex Theuma:Really divided audience.  Rob Walling:Because it was like an art piece.  Alex Theuma:Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the slides were really good, but people were just like, “Yeah, is he really doing this?” And the room was packed, right? But shall we say, I think the majority didn’t really like it too much and we’re not repeating that, but it was bold. We also kind of knew it was going to happen and we’re like, “We’re not sure if you should do that.” But we went with it anyway. So I think that’s one that was pretty interesting and bold by Patrick. And that’s not the reason he’s not coming back this year, but he’s obviously sold his business to paddle and I think he’s busy doing other stuff.  Rob Walling:Pretty busy, yeah, I’ve chatted with him.  Alex Theuma:Another quick story. I think this was probably like 2019 or 2018, but we do speaker dinners and I have to do two of them. I do one on Monday for the speakers on Tuesday and one on Tuesday for the speakers on Wednesday. So it’s quite a lot of food and often a little bit of alcohol consumed, although I’ve been a bit better at that. Certainly last year after one of the speaker dinner, perhaps on the Tuesday night, went on until midnight and then a good group of us then went on somewhere else. And then before I knew it was probably about 3:30 AM and I found myself with a bunch of speakers who were speaking the next day doing shots in a local nightclub, not feeling great when we were doing the shots. And then we probably rolled in about 4:00 AM. I had to be on stage at like eight 30 with one guy that was with me. I could barely open my mouth, it was so dry. And he was fine, he was finished, he was just like… it didn’t affect him whatsoever. And then one of the other speakers that was with us, he then had to speak that morning. I saw him after his talk and he said he vomited at the side of the stage and then one of the other guys that was with us turned sober after that experience. So it was some night. And then I did think to myself, “Is it responsible for me as the conference organizer to be out drinking with the speakers at that time in the morning?” So I haven’t repeated it, shall we say.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s an interesting thing because, I’ll admit, the first few years of MicroConf, I would often stay up till 4:00 AM 5:00 AM with people because it’s so fun and you’re hanging out and then it would take its toll. I never did it with speakers, I would’ve always been like, “Oh no.” But you do learn these lessons. In retrospect, it’s like obviously you don’t want to do that, but you’re in the moment and you’re hanging out and you’re friends and you’re just like, “Oh, we’ll just have one drink.” So I can imagine that makes a pretty incredible story.  Alex Theuma:Didn’t happen to us yet.  Rob Walling:Yeah, didn’t repeat it for sure. Alex Theuma, thank you so much for coming on Startups For the Rest of Us. Saasstock.com if folks want to see what you’re building and dig in further and SaaStock on Twitter or X, that’s your account. Any other places folks should head to?  Alex Theuma:We’re on LinkedIn. I would say we’re pretty active on LinkedIn and a little bit on X, now I’ve got to get used to saying that. But come to saastock.com, the next conference is 16th through the 18th of October in Dublin. If you haven’t been yet, you’ve got to come once in your life.  Rob Walling:Sounds great. Thanks again for coming on the show.  Alex Theuma:Thanks Rob. Great to be here. Thank you.  Rob Walling:Thanks again to Alex for coming on the show, and thank you for joining me again this week. I’ll be back next week answering some listener questions, still trying to get caught up on that front. Talking about things like bringing on a partner, attending trade shows, offering pre-launch discounts and other questions sent in by folks just like you.

I’m Rob Walling, and in this episode, Ruben Gamez comes back on the show by popular demand and we talk about why launching a second product is usually, but not always, a bad idea. This episode idea comes to us from a listener who sent in a great suggestion about covering this topic. It’s one of those topics you could try to cover in six, seven minutes, like a typical listener question, but it deserves a lot of time. As you can see, this episode is longer than a lot of our standard episodes because there was a lot to fit in. But before we dive into that, tickets to MicroConf US in Atlanta are now on sale, Atlanta, Georgia, April 21st through the 23rd of 2024. Leanna Patch is returning to co-host with me. My hope is that she does not fall off the back of this stage, again. Rand Fishkin will be speaking and it’s generally going to be an awesome event. Hope you can join us in atlanta microconf.com/us, if you want to find the full speaker lineup and buy your ticket. This event will sell out all of our in-person events have been selling out. So if you think you want to come to Atlanta and hang out with me and a couple hundred of your other closest bootstrap founder friends, buy your ticket soon. With that, let’s dive into my conversation with Ruben. Ruben Gamez, welcome back to the show.  Ruben Gamez:Great to be here.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s always good to have you. By popular demand, you’re back on the show this time to talk about when we should and shouldn’t launch a second product. This topic was actually raised by a listener, Daniel Hoyman, sorry if I’m mispronouncing your last name. But Daniel has written in many times over the years with great suggestions for the show and was talking about a comment, an offhand comment I made a couple hundred episodes ago, to be honest. It was an episode with Jordan Gal, I think it was 499. I quickly said something like, “Oh, launching a second product, it’s usually a bad idea, but you, Jordan Gal, convinced me at the time that this was one of those cases where it’s a good idea.” Daniel was like, “Have you ever thought about recording an episode that actually walks through the pros and cons?” Daniel, is the CEO and founder of Intelligent Editing at intelligentediting.com. And, after being a single product company for 14 years, he is actually building a second product as well, has decided it’s the right time. So I wanted to bring someone on the show who, much like you and me and Jordan, have been faced with this decision themselves because I think every founder eventually is faced with it. The question is, what info do they have in their head to make this decision? Because I view it a little bit like a siren song of I’m in a white label, I’m going to translate my app to other languages, these things that are common mistakes in my head. So that’s why you’re on the show, man. Thanks for joining.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, great topic. It comes up a lot. I see it with founders from time to time, so it’ll be good to go over.  Rob Walling:This is one of those where I have developed over the years, a default stance, it’s not an always. All caps always, all caps nevers, I don’t do those, but I have a, you really need to convince me why this isn’t the case or why this isn’t how you should proceed. I feel this way about launching a second product. Usually you probably shouldn’t. The odds are good it’s going to take away your focus and be a distraction. We all have shiny object syndrome as entrepreneurs and we want to chase that next thing and the grass is always greener, right? Similar with, I already mentioned, like white labeling. You launch, everyone’s going to approach about white labeling. Almost always a waste of time, not always, but most of the time. Translating your app into another language, I hear this all the time. Probably four or five times a year I’m talking to a TinySeed company and they go, “I want to translate it into Spanish or Portuguese.” I say things like, “Are you prepared to do support in Spanish, to market in Spanish, to have all your documentation translated into Spanish, to have the app itself and the error messages translated in this?” It’s just on and on and on. It’s really this Pandora’s box. But again, Jordan certainly convinced me. He was asking my opinion as an investor advisor at the time and I remember at the end of the call being like, “I think you should do this. You obviously feel very strongly and it seems like it could be the right call,” and in his case it was. You have been faced with the same decision. So I’m curious, do you also have a default stance when you come to this or is it purely case by case if founders approach you and ask if they should build a second product?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, when somebody asks me, usually to me I’m leaning towards you probably shouldn’t do it. Most of the time it’s a bad idea. What I noticed, and I don’t know if this is what you’ve noticed too, it’s usually more of a reactive thing. They’re reacting to something. They’re reacting to slow growth or… In some cases it makes sense if there’s massive platform risk and you have to react, that’s sort of like a good time to react to that in that sort of way. But it’s often like they plateaued or they’re stuck and they can’t figure out how to grow past and they suspect that maybe they tapped out the market, that comes up a lot as well. Things like that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s what usually bothers me, is it’s usually someone who doesn’t want to face the real problem head on and they’re trying to find another route around it rather than saying, “No, I just need to market more, sell more, change my pricing, find product market fit,” whatever it is that they’re looking for, this shortcut around it, in a grass is greener way.  Ruben Gamez:Yes, exactly. That’s the thing, it’s not a shortcut and it’s not easier than the problem that they’re facing, usually.  Rob Walling:Right. This is interesting to set the stage here, can we tell the story a bit of BidSketch and SignWell and how you bootstrapped BidSketch nights and weekends, you launched it I believe in 2009, so you’re like SaaS OG, bootstrap SaaS OG here, and you grew it to a point where it was a great income. You own a 100% of the business and then you had a big decision to make at a certain point involving… I mean it was like a rewrite, it was second… It eventually evolved. Can you talk through that piece of it? I don’t remember. Do you remember what year it was even? Was it like 2016, 17?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I don’t remember the exact year. Part of it was that BidSketch was around for a long time. When we started BidSketch, there was no category of proposal apps. There was for the enterprise, but it looks very, very different. It was like a lot of consulting and the software side of it was very different, to this day it’s still like that. There was nothing in… My initial thought was something like FreshBooks, a little bit more like that but for proposals. So we went into it and there was nothing. When you go fresh into a category like that, there are a lot of things that you need to figure out and do and some things you get right, some things you get wrong. Over time we had just going through several different teams and not paying down technical debt enough really. We ended up in a spot where we had an older code base and it was harder to release the types of features that we needed to and we needed to really rethink the product. We should have probably done that earlier because we had learned so much. Everyone in the category and most of the apps that, especially early in the category, they eventually just dropped out and failed and weren’t around. But there was so much that needed to be figured out. Nobody knew what it looked like. By the time we figured out, okay, this is what this base looks like, it was time to sort, all right, let’s approach it with everything that we’ve learned and have a product for this market. That’s when I started thinking about all of the… Because we did a lot of research at that point and we were thinking about how to approach the rewrite, how to approach the next version of BidSketch. Then it was about, well while we’re doing this, there’s also this need here and we integrate with e-sign services, but we get asked to just add that into BidSketch. In the category, it’s a very basic version of E-sign. The thinking was we can better support the full document signing process for our existing customers as a strategy and then open up the market as well and compete in the e-sign market. So be in a bigger market and use everything that we’ve learned to just build a better product. So we started off with that approach. My first thought was let’s build the e-sign features, specific features first and then add the document. There’s so much overlap between the products, add the document creation features next. But once we started building the e-sign features, the market started pulling us in a very different direction and there was a decision at that point to continue with the original vision or just go into the e-sign market by itself.  Rob Walling:This is something that was so impressive to me as you went through it because you and I have talked once a month for 13 years, 12 or 13 years. So I followed this journey along with you and I was so impressed with the fact… I remember you went back to basically refactor BidSketch and you had devs working on it for something like six months, rewriting code, adding unit tests, upgrading because you were on an old version of Rails or whatever. At a certain point you’re like, I’m going to change course. You didn’t get caught in the sunk cost fallacy. You had a bunch of sunk costs and you’d made the best decision but then you said this is not the right decision anymore. A big part of it was this market pull of I think we need to make it a standalone app and then we’ll build everything else in. Then you were pulled yet in another direction of it was pretty obvious that this market wanted something that maybe you hadn’t envisioned early on. Do you want to describe to someone listening what that feels like? There are some folks who don’t know what market pull feels like. What did that feel like? Was a lot of requests for something? Or how would you describe it?  Ruben Gamez:You’ll get a number of requests for certain types of features from certain types of customers. The thing is that it doesn’t always… So we have shifted product strategy twice. The first time I’d say it was really just a volume thing. It was just most of the requests that were coming in were taking us in a different direction and the types of customers that they were coming from looked a lot less than what I had envisioned and what we were serving with BidSketch. So that combination just made it clear this is a different thing. The next time it was less of a volume thing, it was less clear that everyone wants this because it’s not so much about that. In our case it was these really high value customers are requesting this and there’s this opportunity and we’re not getting a ton of this, we’re getting some of it, but there’s something there. It’s investigating that and seeing how big that opportunity is and what it really looks like and that sort of drove the next one.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that makes sense. So then you found yourself with BidSketch, which is a proposal software and it’s a SaaS, it’s still doing great and generating tens of thousands a month in revenue and SignWell, which is electronic signature. Now you have two products technically under one corporate umbrella, but really it’s almost like two companies really, not technically, but they’re two completely separate domains and all of that. I guess, through your experience, and we’re going to dig in a second to… We’re going to generalize this and go to the pitfalls and exceptions of when it does make sense or not to do a second product, as well as maybe some goals behind that. But for you now that you find yourself in this situation running two products, you have a single dev team, do you feel like it’s complicated? Do you feel good about where you are or do you wish that you could focus on just a single product at this point?  Ruben Gamez:I feel good where we are now because we are mostly focused on a single product, is how it is really. BidSketch is just a more mature product and if I was devoting equal energy towards growing both of them, then it would be a really tough thing. I don’t think that works that well. But all my energy when it comes to thinking about growth and getting business to the next level and all that is focused on SignWell. That’s why that works.  Rob Walling:Right, in a sense you have two products technically, but BidSketch really more is in… It’s a stable product that just keeps running. I am not going to say autopilot. That doesn’t exist. There is no autopilot. Eventually your marketing falls off. Everything decays, right? Your tech stack gets older. You can’t find developers for it. The security stuff’s introduced and security flaws and blah blah blah. So it’s not true autopilot, but it’s maybe as low maintenance as you can have it. Is that pretty accurate?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it’s much more low. As soon as you stop adding a bunch of features and all that, a lot of the risks goes out of the product. So you fix a bunch of bugs, it just gets very stable and then it’s really just about making sure that you support the newer customers that are coming in and upgrading.  Rob Walling:I want to point out here, there’s different ways to add a second product. Sometimes you add a second product and that product far outstrips the first one in terms of revenue growth, all this stuff, which is what has happened for you with SignWell. That happened with me with Drip. I had HitTail. HitTail was doing $25,000, $30,000 a month, great lifestyle business. I was like, I’m going to start another one of those because HitTail really was… It was like a feature. It didn’t have ongoing development basically, so it was as autopilot as probably about you could get aside from the marketing. So I was going to launch another one of those, it’ll be fun and then suddenly Drip takes off and now it’s like what do I do with this other thing? So for me, I held onto HitTail for a few years and then I wound up selling it in 2015. So usually one of them gets all your attention, but there are folks I know who will launch two and then hang on to both of them and have them be equal attention split, try to 50/50 their attention. I think that’s pretty dangerous and that actually maybe gets to our first pitfall here. What are the pitfalls of doing this? Why is our default stance that you probably shouldn’t do it? It’s focus, because as bootstrapped entrepreneurs or mostly bootstrap entrepreneurs, even if you had a team of five, ten, 20 people, if you put all those people on one product, it’s going to grow faster, it should grow faster. But if you split that focus between two, it’s so hard. Dude, I even remember… So Leadpages acquired Drip. They had 170 employees and I remember getting in there and they had Leadpages and they had Center, which was this product, they were trying to get off the ground. Some people there kept saying, this split focus is hurting us. Some people thought it was a great idea for diversification and for whatever other reasons and other people were like, “It’s really hurting us.” I was like, “Split focus? There’s 170 of you. You have $38 million in mentor funding.” But you know what, it was split focus, even at that scale.  Ruben Gamez:Right, I remember when Leadpages came out with Center. Around how many people did they put on that product?  Rob Walling:I don’t honestly know exact numbers, but I know they had an early access where they got a 100 or 200, and got them on and they tried it out and they didn’t have product market fit was an issue and that’s what they kept spinning on was trying to figure out where do we fit in the market? Because really it was Clay Collins, CEO, had a vision and it was trying to start a new category. It was supposed to be the Center, it was the marketing automation, but it didn’t send emails, so it was like the center of your stack. So it was like Segment, but I think it kept state, it’s hard to… So you hear me trying to explain it, which tells me there is no category. It wasn’t Zapier, it was like Zapier plus Segment for marketers. So it was this new category and as we know, that’s hard to do.  Ruben Gamez:Right, that’s super hard. Yeah, no, I was thinking more in terms of the internal team, like how many… It was split, right, how many?  Rob Walling:Yeah, engineering team was, I think, probably between six and ten engineers. Then they had a marketing squad of four or five people that I think were coming over from Leadpages. If I were to guess everyone who did some work on it, even though some were split, it was probably 20.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, okay. Then because they care about this new thing, like the executive team leadership and all that, they’re thinking about it and they’re working on it. Yeah, definitely splits the focus right there.  Rob Walling:There’s two things going on with that example. There’s splitting focus, second product, and then there’s category creation, which we could probably record a whole other podcast about how hard that is. But let’s just take the example of a mostly bootstrap founder with a team of five, a team of ten, a team of 20 whatever. To split focus, especially when… If your first product is working and there’s still room to grow it, I’m always like, “Don’t do this because you’re just going to leave growth on the table.” But if your first one stalls and it isn’t growing anymore, what then? Should you focus on that first product and keep growing it or do you split focus?  Ruben Gamez:I think it depends on the core reason why the growth has stalled. Yeah, it’s really hard to generalize in this case, but a lot of times really when people’s growth stalls, they often don’t know. I think you need to investigate and you need to… As best as you can. Sometimes we just don’t know for sure, but as best as you can tell, just stop working on the symptoms or thinking about the symptoms like, oh, our churn is too high or we’re not getting enough signups or whatever. Well yeah, of course that’s a symptom. What’s the core reason? What’s going on here? It’s like, oh, I think we’ve tapped out on this market is a common one. It’s like really, have you?  Rob Walling:That’s usually not true, yes.  Ruben Gamez:That’s right.  Rob Walling:No, I see it where there’s a million potential customers in a market, someone has 500 customers and they plateaued or they have 50 customers or something and they’re like, “Oh, I’ve tapped out the market, need to check out the Spanish market.” It’s like, no, you don’t. Solve the problem. What’s the actual problem?  Ruben Gamez:It’s more likely that they’ve exhausted the marketing channels in the way that they’ve gone about marketing or sales or whatever, their current approach has been exhausted. Yes, okay, maybe if you’ve tapped that out, that’s something else, but are there other channels? Can you bring in somebody that can help you on the growth side, whether it’s somebody internally or somebody to help on the consulting or an agency or whoever? You have to start making bigger changes. It’s hard to get there just doing the same stuff or just slightly different versions of the same thing if you’re really plateaued. So yeah, I think there are a lot of things at play there and it all comes down to, for me, the reason why growth is stalled.  Rob Walling:I think that’s a good take on it. I guess the last thought I have on focus and splitting focus, because I want to get to our other topics, but splitting focus of the team is one thing. Most people don’t realize… I’ve had people say, “Oh, I have this code base and I built it for CRM for realtors and it would totally work for mortgage brokers. So what I’m going to do is I’m going to go, I’m going to register another domain and I’m going to start the prep, because the codes the same. So it’s not really that much work.” I’m always like, “You realize the code’s about 10% of the business.” Just even if you’re going to do SEO, you’re splitting your domain authority. All the links you’ve built, you’re starting from zero, start the Google timer over. All of your marketing, any cold outreach, any brand equity you have, any traffic you have, now split. Your support team now has to… You don’t need double the support people, but they have to now know two products. You’re making two decisions about what features to build into which products. You’re splitting your dev team. On and on and on, it is way more than you initially think about. It’s the iceberg problem, right?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, and I did that in the early stages when I was doing BidSketch and SignWell. That’s what we were doing because we had to. It was too early in the SignWell days, but even then it was just clear this is not sustainable. It just wasn’t.  Rob Walling:Right. I can imagine someone hearing this and saying, well, I’m not going to register two domains. I’m going to have two products under one umbrella, right? I am going to keep the same domain. So you could have had BidSketch.com and you have two products, much like I think of Intercom almost having two. They have what four products, five?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah.  Rob Walling:It’s like they have the chat and they have the support, and they have the this and that. HubSpot is similar, where HubSpot is an umbrella and then they have all these different tools under it. So that wouldn’t split as much, but it still comes back to splitting focus and being a lot to bite off. You do have to market those individually. You have to position them individually. You are fighting battles on multiple fronts. I think of it as, I always say, like two-sided marketplaces, here’s my advice, don’t, that’s because you’re… It’s like they’re starting two SaaS apps at once. It’s just you’re fighting things on two fronts. I think two products will make it tough, but there are exceptions. There are exceptions to it. So you did it and I guess I would ask you, you made an exception, you have a two products. Was it the right choice for you?  Ruben Gamez:Yes, for us it was the right choice. I could have gone either way with it as far as I went in a completely different direction, but I could have just kept it with BidSketch and just truly made it version two and gone in the other direction with the original. I think it would’ve worked out. There isn’t a clear right or wrong choice sometimes. You can have multiple paths that can work or you can have paths that are just going to be a lot more risky and difficult and all. I think just being deliberate and knowing what you’re getting yourself into and why is a big part of it.  Rob Walling:Why was your choice the right one, in retrospect? If someone else is facing this same choice, what were the factors that made it make sense for you and that have led to it being the quote-unquote “right choice”?  Ruben Gamez:There was a significant amount of time and energy and work put into the decision and identifying the problem, or the problems, the things that we were trying to solve for. So it was clear after a while that there was opportunity, a lot of opportunity, and I iteratively tested things along the way. So even though I felt… It’s not like you do all this work up front and then you say, “Okay, this is what we’re doing,” and then heads down and just go in that direction and don’t look, right? I was constantly evaluating and thinking about, okay, is this right? Do I need to make adjustments? So it turned out to… It worked out. A lot of the reason why it worked out was because of the reason I was just deliberate. I was able to identify real opportunities and then verify that those opportunities were real and kept checking myself throughout the process and then just changed whenever I needed to change.  Rob Walling:That’s the thing, there are always exceptions to these. You are particularly a deep thinker and someone who challenges and is willing to challenge their own hypotheses. So when you come to me with a conclusion or close to a conclusion, I’m always like, I’ll ask you questions, but I’m pretty sure you’ve answered all the questions I’m going to ask you already in your own head. That’s your personality, right? There are folks on the other end who just wake up in the morning and there’s a dream where they’re like, I think I should launch a second product. Every question I ask them about, “I haven’t thought about any of them,” right? They haven’t validated. They haven’t really given a thought. So I think this part of it, a little bit of this, is knowing yourself, are you someone who just bounced, bounced? Are you the indie hacker who’s in the trap of launch, it didn’t take off immediately on Product Hunt, I’m just going to give up and go to the next thing because it’s not working? It’s a siren song of over and over because you get the launched dopamine, but you don’t actually put in the work to really grow the product. If that’s more of where you fall, then really listen to our advice to not do it. But if you don’t and you are more of a [inaudible 00:24:19] person, or even if there are some folks the other-  Ruben Gamez:Or you lean the other direction, right, like too strongly, right? The opposite, yeah. You should probably examine it and think about it, yeah.  Rob Walling:Right, because don’t we have friends who have started one product and tried to grow it for years and years and years and they’re at 2K MMR after six years. There it’s like, I don’t know if you need a second product or you just need to kill the first one. But some people stick with stuff too long, right? So maybe you could break it loose. I’ll give you another counter example. I have two more in my head, but one is Jordan, right? Jordan Gal who it was just-  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I was wondering what did he tell you that convinced you?  Rob Walling:So to set the stage, he had built CartHook, which was cart abandonment emails. I believe it was just for Shopify. I don’t remember if it was just for Shopify or for all e-com, but whatever it was, someone abandoned their cart, then they would send them emails. He’d gotten it up to low tens of thousands MRR. Then he found out… They either found or somehow got wind that there was an unpublished Shopify API that allowed you to modify their checkout and modifying it… Because their checkout was garbage basically, and you couldn’t change it. Everybody knew it was garbage, right? It was built in 2007 and it had never been updated or whatever, so it didn’t have upsells. It didn’t have all the conversions. Anything you’d want on a checkout, it just didn’t have. So he saw this huge opportunity. It’s like we’re going to get in there, we’re going to write code against this unpublished API. Then we’re going to work to… Once it’s published, we’ll be one of the first ones and we’ll get approval to basically be an app and people are clamoring for this. So he was then in some maybe Facebook groups or whatever slack groups where these… A lot of them, it’s a lot of D2C physical products, right, they’re just selling through Shopify. They all wanted post-purchase upsells, or during purchase or post-purchase upsells and they could add this in using this. So he’s like, “The people I’m talking to are losing their minds if we could add this to Shopify.” I was like, “I don’t know man. The cart abandonment emails seem to be working. Why would you go do this?” We talked for probably 45 minutes and he just kept saying… And this is it, Jordan, his intuition is pretty good. You know what I mean? When I say pretty good, I mean really good. I’m understating. His intuition of where the gap is… There’s certain founders you know, whether it’s… I don’t know if they’ve had it their whole life or they learn it. I think you and I have good intuition, Jordan, there’s certain folks we know. That was a piece of it, he had this very strong gut feeling that it was a green open field. It wasn’t a grasses greener. It wasn’t a that that’ll be easier. It’s I want to get there first and I want to own it. That was really the conversation and I asked him all the questions that we’re talking about here. Is it just hard and not growing? How are you going to do it? Are you going to sunset the other one? How are you going to focus on two? It was all those questions and he was like, “Look, we’re going to put some engineering, we can build this.” This was another thing, how long does it take to test this? When will you know? Will you know in a year or will you know in two months? I believe he said it would be two months of engineering, maybe three. I was like, “That’s a lot of time at this early stage.” But he had runway. He had raised a fund strapped a very small round for me and some other folks’. This is pre-TinySeed. It was that line of thinking where I was like… Then I said, “What if this fails? What’s the flip side? What if this works? What if this fails? Is there asymmetric upside if this works?” The answer was, “Absolutely.” The entire company… I mean, the end of the story is eventually I think they just sold off or gave away their cart abandonment element of it and the post-purchase upsells just took… Just the cart, the checkout replacement took off like a Cinderella story basically.  Ruben Gamez:Right, yeah. I think maybe shut it down. It was so… It was making money.  Rob Walling:The cart abandonment?  Ruben Gamez:Right.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Ruben Gamez:Maybe sold it or was seriously considering, yeah. But compared to the difference between how well the new product was doing versus the old, it wasn’t even worth putting that much time into figuring out what to do with it. I think you’re right. I think he might’ve partly sold it. No, that’s interesting to hear because I was talking to Jordan a lot during that time as well. We talked regularly. I remember when that happened. I remember thinking similar things like, oh, okay, you’re doing-  Rob Walling:Shiny object.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, you’re doing pretty good. But you’re right, it’s funny because it was him, because he doesn’t have a history of just jumping to the next thing and just building out and his intuition is really good, I was like, okay, there’s probably something here, this could be really interesting. So I thought the same thing. But I think that brings up a really good point as far as I think a lot of people who have a problem with it and add products sooner than they should do feel like they have an opportunity that they see, but it’s more than that. It goes back to partly how good is your product intuition, and this is based off of your history? What have you seen and where do you lean? Do you lean towards just moving on and not finishing things and not pushing things through or the opposite? Depending on those answers, you really need to examine that more or push yourself more to do something new if it’s the other way.  Rob Walling:Right, and get outside feedback. Because what did Jordan do? He talked to you. He talked to me. I know he talked to other people and he got input. You did the same thing when you were launching SignWell. You talked to a bunch of people, including me, and you were trying to get outside, not confirmation, but outside information about what am I missing? Why is this good or bad? Two other things I just said about Jordan’s decision was in addition to his vision or his intuition is like, does it have asymmetric upside if it works? Is the downside if it fails, not catastrophic? And, how quickly can you test this or how quickly will you know? Because usually, yeah, another product is six months, nine months. That’s a really long time. You better be damn sure that it’s going to work.  Ruben Gamez:That’s why in decisions like that where it’ll be a while before you know, so you have to invest time, energy, money or whatever for a while, and the opportunity cost there is that you’re not growing your other thing or whatever. When the feedback cycle is slow like that, that’s when it pays off to put in more work upfront and that’s work in these conversations, doing little tests or doing whatever. If the feedback cycle is fast and you’ll know in a week, you don’t even have to talk to anybody, just try it and it’ll be a week before you know and then you move forward or whatever. It really depends on how long that feedback cycle is.  Rob Walling:On the point of feedback cycle… There’s one more example and then I want to get to our strategies or goals behind adding a product and then we’ll wrap. One more example. I know of several other examples, but you and Jordan, and then Stratosphere is the third example. Stratosphere is a TinySeed company. You can see them at stratosphere.io and their H1 is the all-in-one data visualization platform for investors research platform. It’s a rolling thing. When the AI stuff started getting popular… When the AI stuff. When ChatGPT and everything was buzzing six, eight months ago, they built finchat.io. My memory is they built and shipped it in six weeks. It was very fast and they got instant traction. It was one thing that, the downside if it didn’t work was not that much. I remember again, they brought it up and I was like, no, the second product, why are you doing that? All the stuff we’ve said here. They were like, it’s not going to take that long to test, the asymmetric upside if this really does catch, it would be the only thing doing this, and if it catches, it’s going to be astronomical. In addition, they already had… They’re not just a ChatGPT wrapper. What they did is with Stratosphere, they have all this proprietary data that they’ve cleaned that you can only get through their API or their interface and FinChat is a chat interface to that proprietary data. So even at that point, if it works, I suggest, it’s just another interface into what they’re already building. And, long-term… We talked early on. I said, “Well, what if this works? Can you merge this all back into the same product? Is this just a different price point, for instance, on your pricing page? Or is it…” Because right now it’s a separate domain name. But we talked through that possibility. It’s not like it’s some way far out of left field thing that really needs to be its own thing. It could feasibly come back and be part of the home base if it works and if it doesn’t, it was a fun experiment. So that was another one where at the end I said, “Assuming we live up to these things, I sign off.” Not that I needed to sign off, they were going to build it, whether or not it did. But it was another example of, I think, speed, being able to test it quickly.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, which is a big deal in situations like this. One quick thought that I had, a question for you, was you talked about asking for feedback from others. We’ve seen this a lot where founders basically make up their mind and are talking to others and they’re asking for feedback, but all they’re really wanting to hear is people say, “Yeah, I think it’s a good idea.” The ones that don’t, they either… I’m not sure how it’s explained in their mind, they’re either not seeing the vision or whatever, and then any little confirmation, they take that and they run with it. What do you think? Do you have any thoughts about not falling into that trap or what being good at asking for feedback and taking that feedback looks like?  Rob Walling:Yeah, and why I have it is because some point in my history ten years ago, say 15, I was exactly the person you described where I would have a vision for something, I would ask for feedback, and then I would argue with all the feedback because I felt like, oh, you’re attacking my idea, I’m going to defend it because I know I’m right. Then at a certain point, I switched. That was seven, eight years ago, whatever. So I feel like I’m on both sides of that, A\u0026R and my team may disagree with that statement that I’m better at it. No, I just feel like I’m better. What I’ve realized is it’s not… I used to think about it black and white of I have this idea, I’m going to ask for feedback, and if it doesn’t fit my idea, then either they’re wrong or I’m wrong. The idea is wrong or they’re wrong. That’s not actually what it is. Here’s what I do these days. I’ll come up with an idea. I present it to A\u0026R, to producer Zander, to producer Ron. They’ll give feedback and I’m like, oh, with creativity, with growth mindset, that tweaks my idea. I’m going to change my idea. I’m not just going to scrap my idea, it’s a (beep) idea, it didn’t work because of their feedback. It actually will tweak it and make it better. So the format of a YouTube video, for example. I was like, this is how we should structure our YouTube videos. Then someone started… They were like, well, you need a story, you need a hook, you need a teaser at the end, you need this and that. I was like, oh, you’re improving. You’re improving it. It’s not, I should scrap my whole outline. It’s, I should just tweak it. That’s a trite example. But similarly, if I came to you with a business idea and I was like, I’m going to build an ESP for realtors or whatever, and you started having thoughts around it, it shouldn’t be, I should do it or not. It shouldn’t be this black and white thing. It should much more be around am I able to take your feedback and creatively incorporate it into my idea? Or if I’m really getting bad signals, I should just scrap it all together. Does that make sense?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I like that. I hadn’t thought about it in that way, but that’s a really good way to think about it.  Rob Walling:How about you? What’s your advice for someone who maybe tends to fall in that trap of I lock onto my ideas and I really don’t take outside feedback, even though I ask for it, I act like I’ve taken outside feedback, but I have my mind made up already? How do we get around that?  Ruben Gamez:That is tough because I can’t think of a time where I’m thinking in that sort of way. But, I can talk about how I think about it when I am getting feedback, and maybe that can be helpful.  Rob Walling:Yeah, because you’re really good at it. Ever since I’ve known you, and I think we’ve known each other for 15 years, maybe a little more, you’ve never been defensive about your ideas. You’ve always taken feedback in stride and you’re able to identify quickly usually, oh, that is actually a better idea than I had, or that makes my idea better. You’ve had that knack since I met you. So yeah, talk us through how you do that.  Ruben Gamez:So I don’t believe that my idea is finished or is perfect to begin with. So I think of it more as a starting point, that’s the first thing. I really like something that David Cancel, I heard him say a long time ago, which was the way that he thinks about it is that if he has an idea or anything for a feature, for a product or whatever, he figures that it’s wrong and he’s just trying to figure out how wrong it is. Is it 90% wrong? Is it 10% wrong? So I like that sort of mindset and it mirrors the way that I tend to think about it. The other thing is that it’s good to get multiple data points from multiple people, then consider their context, their experience, and then think about how it relates to mine. So I think about all those things when I’m taking in feedback because the context is really important. So as long as I feel pretty good about the people that I’m getting the information from and the feedback that I’m getting, then I can feel pretty good about integrating that or whatever, or at least considering it. Then the other thing is if something really bothers me, if somebody said something that I didn’t expect and it’s rubs me the wrong way or I have a bad feeling about it, that to me is a sign that I should examine that more. There’s something there that I’m like, I’m too married to this part of the idea. You know what I mean? I’m not willing to evaluate every part of it or something like this, to me, it’s a red flag, danger.  Rob Walling:Emotional, you have an having emotional reaction to it, which isn’t helpful.  Ruben Gamez:Exactly, right. That’s a good sign for me to take a look at what’s happening there and really try to consider it.  Rob Walling:It’s a very insightful, mature way of thinking about it rather than reacting, doing the self-examination. So as we move to our last segment here, obviously we’re running long on time and I’m intentionally just letting it do that. Let’s talk about if you decide that adding a second product is viable and it is the right way to go, let’s talk maybe about strategies doing that, behind doing that and goals, maybe the goal of adding a second product. I already talked a little bit about the indie hacker trap, I think, of launching, bouncing to the next, to the next, to the next. That doesn’t fit at all with a strategy, that usually is just a reaction to something. But you had a note in… We have a little outline we’re running from, and you have a, quote, “Portfolio of products” or quote, “Diversification” right, behind adding it. Talk me through that. Do you think that’s a good reason to do it? You think that’s a mistake?  Ruben Gamez:So this is something that I’ve seen go around a lot with in the indie hacker circles, which is they’re talking about a portfolio of products. You’re the OG of portfolio of products, like you did this way back in the day.  Rob Walling:In 2008, yeah.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, that’s when I found out about you and what you were doing. I was like, oh, this is cool, and you were doing a lot of that. The other thing is diversification and the portfolio products seems to be the reason why that’s done is because of diversification. So it’s almost a fear-driven way to approach product and it misses… So that’s behind it, which is like a red flag. Then misses a really big component of SaaS, at least, which is momentum and building… If you split your effort and your energy, time, money, all that, amongst multiple products, it’s really, really, really hard to get any one of them to a scale and level that you probably want to get to because things get easier as you grow more, you add more revenue, it builds on itself. Momentum is a really, really, really big deal, and it’s hard to describe until you’ve felt it, but you’ll never get to the momentum that you need to get into build a million dollar SaaS business or whatever if you’re doing that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and that’s the thing. I mean, you’re referring, I had somewhere… It depends on how you count exactly, but about nine or ten different revenue streams, different products. Almost all of them… Most of them were software. I had one content website. I had an e-commerce website. I had some eBooks, and then I had software. Some of it was one-time sales, some of it was SaaS, some of it was B2C. This is where I learned all the lessons, right, that we started talking about at the MicroConf, like don’t do B2C, raise your prices, et cetera, et cetera. I found exactly that. It was fun. I talk about the stair step method all the time, right? Step one is just cutting your teeth, doing something small, making a $1,000, $5,000 a month. Step two is having usually multiple of those step one businesses, doesn’t always have to be, but usually it’s multiple to get to that magic number, maybe $8,000 for some people a month, maybe $10,000 maybe $12,000, $15,000 whatever. So step two is building, I’d say a small portfolio of products. You get a little diversification. You get some more learnings, and you get to buy out your own time. You own all your time. Then you go after the big standalone. That’s the progression that I see and I think most people will follow. Now, there is this flip side, the indie hacker lifestyle dream that you’re talking about. Well, you get the portfolio and you’re perpetually traveling or you’re just working the four-hour workweek. That’s not a bad thing, but to your point, it hampers momentum. You will rarely, if ever, get to that seven figure goal, if that’s something you want to do. Honestly, there aren’t that many people. There are not thousands of people doing that. There are a handful of people that are truly doing that, I built a big Twitter following and now everything I launch people jump on. If you want to try to be the Tom Cruise of indie hackers where there’s like, oh, there’s one star that does this or there’s four we can name and everyone else it’s like… But how many hundreds, no, thousands of founders do you and I know who have done this other path of getting to that point of having that SaaS and focusing and building it? It’s just a more viable thing. We’ve talked probably more about indie hacking than we even should have with this, but I think that’s where a lot of the multiple product stuff comes in. That’s not where Daniel Hoyman with Intelligent Editing is not going. He has a 14-year product and truly is talking about adding a second product line to his company, which again, it is just a different conversation. But I mean, let’s say you add the second product. I guess we already talked a little bit about starting a whole new business where it’s a new domain, but let’s say you add the product to your lineup to where you can cross-sell the two of them. That’s a benefit someone could talk about. What’s the pros and cons of that and when does that make sense, I guess?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, there are companies that do this successfully. It’s a proven way to go, but it’s not easy. It’s harder to sell even a new solution to the customers that you have. It’s almost like designing a new tier, a new plan, that people would upgrade into, but it’s a little bit more of a jump there than just upgrading to a different plan and adding new features. So if you think of Intercom, they’d famously do this, their pricing is a mess because of it. Zoho, I think does this pretty well.  Rob Walling:HubSpot.  Ruben Gamez:HubSpot, right. So there are these products that get there. I think moving in that direction too early is a mistake. That’s one of the more common mistakes, probably driven by a lot of the same reasons why people just do a separate product to begin with. Assuming that people will buy the product from you just because they’re already a customer is another mistake.  Rob Walling:Right, that you think you’re just going to sell a copy of the new one to every existing customer or some huge, huge percentage, right?  Ruben Gamez:Exactly, right.  Rob Walling:Yeah, there’s a really interesting article blog post by Jason Cohen, it’s called The Elephant in the room: The myth of exponential hypergrowth. He talks a lot about how exponential… He’s looking really at the word, and that part is fine, that he’s saying it’s not actually exponential. But there’s one slide later called the Elephant Curve that is very interesting. It’s basically about how every product eventually tops out, that maybe you top out at 500K ARR and maybe you top out at 5 million and maybe top out at 50 million, and it depends on your goals. But if you want to be HubSpot, which is we want to go public, and your HubSpot marketing, inbound marketing tool, basically tops out at 50 million or 100 million, that’s not enough. So remember they made not a pivot, but an additional… CRM was their big thing they went all in on seven, eight years ago. They really won a lot of the space from, well, from all the other players and from Salesforce. Though you’re saying, people do this too early though, is the problem.  Ruben Gamez:Right, all the companies that we mentioned that have done it successfully, they’re of a certain scale and trying to build a certain size company. The way that you described it was right, that it’s not… At some point, these really big companies that are often VC funded and they need to go towards going public or something like that, just where they’re playing is not enough to get them there, so they need more. So you often see that with these companies, but this is a very different position that a lot of startups are in when they start to think about this sometimes. It just goes back to all the same things too, you have to be spread thin and resources, time, focus, all that. It makes the rest more difficult.  Rob Walling:You had a note here that I’m curious, it’s under moving to a bigger market, breaking out of a niche, expanding the market. Obviously we’ve talked about a few successes here with HubSpot and these others, but you talk about some failures with Moz. Did they try to build a second product? I don’t remember this.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, so this is the whole, like, this is future, this is the next thing, right? Yeah, Moz, their thing was like there were going to be a marketing suite. There weren’t going to be a suite for SEO. There were going to be marketing. Rand talks about this in his book to where he’s like, that was one of his biggest mistakes and he was believed so much in this vision that he just went off and spent a lot of time and money and all that focusing on just building this thing. Yeah, so that just didn’t work out that well for them because of that reason.  Rob Walling:Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense, I think that-  Ruben Gamez:It is tricky to make work.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and I think he talked about they didn’t validate it enough. I think if I recall. I read his book, it’s probably five years, so I’m going from memory. This is Rand, so he’s very self-deprecating and has a lot of introspection. I remember him saying something like, “I was the founder. I had the vision and Moz worked and I thought I had the golden touch,” I’m paraphrasing, “So my next thing, I thought I had the golden touch, and was going to be right. And when we did it, it didn’t work out and it was because I had some hubris.” Oh look, all of us do this at one point or another, and I think that’s why we’re recording this episode is to let you know, hey, just because you got one, right, it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t really think through trying to expand to a second product. But obviously it can work right, as it did with CartHook and Stratosphere and with SignWell and with others, so.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, there was one really interesting one real quick with FreshBooks that I saw that they did, because they were invoicing and they went into… Now they’re cloud accounting. What they did was they created a product and called it something different, it wasn’t even FreshBooks. They put it out in the market and started testing it and getting signups. Once they started seeing growth going in the direction that they thought, okay, we have something here, then they were like, okay, rename this is FreshBooks, the new thing. So I thought that they took a very interesting approach to doing the new product.  Rob Walling:That’s a nice way to do it. Very elegant. Well, Ruben Gomez, thanks so much for joining me on the show. Not only joining me on the show, but going over time. I know we have a busy schedule and we’re already over our allotted time.

Pay attention to the problem customers describe, not so much the solution they propose. This is an encapsulation and a really intelligent rephrasing of something that Derek Reimer and I started talking about probably I’d say 2014, 2015, which is your customers will come to you with featured ideas. Don’t build those features, dig in and find out what is the job that feature is trying to accomplish. Welcome back to another episode of Startups For The Rest of Us. As always, I’m your host, Rob Walling. And this is the podcast where we dive deep into building real companies for real customers who pay us real money where we’re not constantly on the venture treadmill needing to raise money every 18 months or go broke. We’re not anti-funding, we’re just anti the narrative that the only way to build an incredible software company is by raising funding. Today is a Rob solo adventure. I’m going to cover some topics that have been on my mind lately, including listening to problems, not solutions. Listening to your customers instead of a customer doing what it takes and maybe a few more topics based on how the time winds up. And one more thing, we’ve recently reopened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other and discussing wins, challenges, and frankly how to grow faster. A couple months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your request. With MicroComp Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out. microconfconnect.com. My first topic of the day comes from Twitter. I just refuse to call it X. I’m sorry. I saw a tweet from Ruben Gamez, Earthlingworks and he was quote tweeting sequence film. Sequence underscore film. Sequence was quoting comedian, Bill Hader on receiving feedback. And there’s a little video clip that’s, I don’t know, a minute long and it’s pretty insightful. But the quote that they post in the tweet is, “When people tell you something is wrong, they’re usually right. When they tell you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong. And Bill Hader is talking about being a standup comedian or being a writer in film and how people can tell you when a joke doesn’t land or when a concept doesn’t land. But knowing how to fix it requires something that I’ve talked about many times on the show, which is that creative spark and taste to be able to find the right solution because there are infinite ways to try to make a joke or a scene better. And most of them won’t land. So how do you find one or two that makes it really scream? And usually people giving you feedback are not those that are also creating. It is this interesting thing where you are on the outside and I’m listening to a podcast. And if I’ve never recorded a podcast, I have a certain amount of taste to say, “Oh, this is good or this is bad based on my taste, or this is high quality and this isn’t.” But for me to then suggest, “Here’s how I would change it. I would add different music here. I would’ve asked this question. That’s another level. That’s that Ira Glass level of your ability, your skill through hard work has to catch up to your taste. And that’s what Bill is calling out here. When people tell you something is wrong, they’re usually right. And when they tell you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong. So why is Ruben Gamez retweeting this? Because he says it works this way for products too. Pay attention to the problem customers describe not so much the solution they propose. This is an encapsulation and a really intelligent rephrasing of something that Derek Reimer and I started talking about probably I’d say 2014, 2015, which is your customers will come to you with featured ideas. Don’t build those features, dig in and find out what is the job that feature is trying to accomplish. Over and over we would receive different feature requests from folks who are trying to do complex workflows and they would come in and say, “I have an email sequence in Drip and I want to be able to have an if-then L statement and add a tag between them and then branch based on that. Can you add that to this screen?” And we even had people mock-up the email sequence screen to work for their exact use case. Derek and I would get together and it never felt right. It was like that solution is terrible, but this problem is real. This person is this marketer, is trying to accomplish something that is very difficult or impossible with our current setup. So how do we build this in? And we mold it over four months, at least six months, maybe a year. And we took all these disparate points of feedback and you’d get that one and then you’d get one that was quite a bit different. But it was like, “Well, these are similar,” and that someone wants to do something off the cuff and they want branching decision-making. How do we build that into the product in an elegant way? And of course, after six to 12 months of building and growing and we hired another engineer, it started culminating in the sense that we need something probably visual to allow people to do all of this stuff. And that was when we started looking around realizing, “Oh, there are actual visual workflow builders in email marketing and marketing automation and they allow you to do some of the things these folks are asking plus more.” And that was a big lightning strike realization for me where I realized that a swath of problems, a swath of requests, could all be fixed with one feature. Now it was a huge feature and took Derek five months full time to build, which if you’re looking at it from a big company perspective, that’s actually very fast. And if you’re looking at it from a startup perspective, it’s agonizing that it takes that long. But that was our visual workflow builder in Drip and it solved literally 50 feature requests that had come through in the span of a year. And all these feature requests could have been individual settings, an individual toggle, an individual hack to a screen. This is, in my opinion, what separates great product people from average. I wouldn’t say mediocre, but an average product person will listen to something and say, “Oh, the customer wants this. Let’s go build it and let’s add that checkbox. Let’s add that slider. And let’s hack this screen because It’ll get us to what this customer needs. Not looking ahead 10 moves, only looking ahead one move on the board.” And that’s what Ruben Gamez is talking about here is your customers are not going to have the product sense to be able to design your product. They don’t have the vision for what it needs to look like. They don’t have the vision for what the UX needs to be to keep the elegance in. They see a problem they have and the shortest path to a solution. And they’re not worried about maintenance or the user interface getting crafty. They’re not looking three, five, 10 years down the road like you as a founder should be. So just one more reminder again in the words of Ruben Gamez, “Pay attention to the problem customers describe not so much the solutions they propose.” My second topic of the day is a quote from one of the co-hosts of the Comic Lab podcast. I like listening to podcasts that are not in the startup space. Comic Lab is two comic artists who have made a living doing Kickstarters and Patreon. Their comics are quite funny, especially Dave Kellett. I’m a huge fan of Drive and of Sheldon. Sheldon is just tasty, goodness, nerdy humor that my sons and I have read and love. And the thing I like about this podcast is they talk about things like ventriloquism doesn’t work in comics. They talk about things like kerning and about drawing thought bubbles versus speech bubbles in comics, panel construction, thumbnails. These are things I have no understanding of and will never need to because I have no aspiration to be a comic artist. But so many of the principles that they talk about as two 20-year professionals who have made it in a space that is very competitive and I would say is similar to startups. And the fact that there’s a lot of people that want to do it and a few people who actually do it, and even fewer who can make a living at it, and even fewer who can make a living at it for 20 years. So listening to them talk about the lessons they’ve learned, and realizing the massive parallels between that and starting up. And also taking some thought lessons, some thought experiment lessons away from them I think has been beneficial to me. One of the quotes that co-host, Brad Geiger said was don’t listen to a customer, always listen to your customers. What he means by that is the squeaky wheel. There’s often one person who is so squeaky and so loud about a thing and they can convince you that just because they’re being loud and repeating it over and over that you should do that. So in their world, it’s making a T-shirt with this particular character on it or it’s publishing a book, collecting whatever particular strips on a theme that you could collect. And in our world, it’s listening to that customer who is just so convinced that if you built this one feature that they need so badly that it would just blow your market wide open. In fact, they’re so shocked. They’re shocked it already doesn’t do this. Really surprised that your product doesn’t do this massive edge case feature that you’re probably never going to build. But boy, they just know. They’re a business person and they’ve run a business for 20 years and they just know that that feature. It’s only going to take two or three months of development is going to make or break your business. And that’s a case of don’t listen to a customer, always listen to your customers. If five customers are starting to request this or 10, or 50, this is where being a founder or a product owner in any form requires a little bit of some science, but it has to have some art in it as well, right? There’s that founder gut. There’s the vision for your product mixed along with the actual hard left brain data that you’re getting. This is where you have to balance that. And this is why finding product market fit specifically and then even the first few years of product development are so challenging because it’s a ton of decisions, hundreds of little decisions that you’re making, they’re very hard and they set the tone of your product and of your company. And you’re making them with dramatically incomplete information. It’s not like you have 50% of the information. You have 10, 15% if you’re lucky. And that’s why if you take someone who does product management at a large company or a mature product that’s been around for 10 years and you put them in the spot of we don’t have product market fit or we have five customers get us there to where we’ve built something that people want and are willing to pay for. Usually they won’t succeed because they’re too used to having so much data and they’re used to making hard decisions with mostly complete information. But in your shoes, whether you’re on day one of your company or day 1000 a few years in, you’re still probably making a lot of hard decisions with incomplete information. And that’s why listening to your customers rather than a customer was a good reminder for me to hear from Brad Geiger. Well, the exact application of it obviously differs between writing a comic strip and building a product. It can be especially hard when let’s say you have 10 customers and one customer says something over and over. It’s like 10% of your customer base. You just don’t have enough data to know if that’s the right way to go. And that’s why in that early phase you do have to think about how do I trust my gut and what’s my vision of the product? And that has to play a pretty big role in guiding where you are headed because if you let customers guide you, most of the time, they’ll just have you rebuild MailChimp or Basecamp or HubSpot. They’ll just have you replicate that because that’s what they’ve used and that’s what they know and they’ll just keep suggesting those features and pretty soon you will have just a clone of another product. You have to ask yourself along the way, “Am I properly integrating my own vision for this product along with listening to my customers?” Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

And sometimes it’s grinding for five hours on a Sunday afternoon and sometimes it’s grinding 60-hour weeks for two or three months when it really needs to get done. Now, that’s not necessarily a sustainable pace, but there have absolutely been many, many times during my career, especially as I became an entrepreneur where I had to work harder than I wanted to. I wanted to work 40-hour weeks and instead I worked 60 sometimes a little more when I was working a day job and working nights and weekends. I get questions from time to time. Sometimes they’re directly to me and sometimes they’re on this podcast about how to balance that, about how it’s difficult. And frankly sometimes I get questions about how do you even manage it and balance it all. Not me in particular, but how does a founder. How do other bootstrappers go about making this happen when doing what it takes can be hard and it can push you past a comfort zone. So to demonstrate this, I want to tell you a story. So as you know, over the summer I did a Kickstarter for The SaaS Playbook. That went really well, sold a few thousand copies, and once the Kickstarter ended, I wanted there to be an opportunity for people to be able to purchase the book because the day it ended, there was still all this traffic to the Kickstarter page and all this traffic coming to saasplaybook.com, which is where the book lives. It’s the home of the book. And while the Kickstarter was on, there was a button that said, “Go back to the Kickstarter.” But the day it ended still getting hundreds of uniques a day, I want to be able to take pre-orders that are after the Kickstarter, right? So the Kickstarter had exclusives. It was a limited and one time print run of hardcovers. But when the Kickstarter ended, you could basically, I think pay the same amount and get a paperback copy that would come after the book was released. So I was taking pre-orders. And while the Kickstarter was fulfilled by a professional fulfillment house, because of course it was thousands of copies of the book, the paperback copies, I figured they might sell 100, 200 paperback copies, which it is feasible to have an assistant as we had back then who comes to our house, drives our kid to school and then can help with little packing needs like that. She’s a part-time local assistant. And it’s totally feasible to have someone print shipping labels, pack up books and get them fulfilled. So that’s what I did. I took pre-orders on The SaaS Playbook. It uses Squarespace cart and I ordered a couple hundred copies of the paperback print on demand from Amazon. And I waited until the book was released. As the release date of the book approached, because obviously I wanted to fulfill all the Kickstarters before shipping out anyone who had ordered after that. As that date approached, our assistant who had been with us for a couple years, decided to move on. She’s headed off to a master’s program and she decided it was time for her next act and we wished her well. So I thought no problem. I have a 17-year-old in the house. He’s going to college in the fall, but certainly I can pay him $2, $3 a package to just fulfill… It’s about the same as you pay at a fulfillment house to print these and fulfill them. Again, if there’s 100, he makes two or $300 just sitting around listening to podcasts and watching YouTube and filling these out, doing it on a weekend day. This is a great gig for him and it means that I don’t have to do it because I don’t particularly want to pack a bunch of books. And then as the timing approached and everything actually landed, the Kickstarter was fulfilled effectively the day that my son left for a two-week writer’s camp during the summer. And so suddenly it’s me and my 13-year-old. Sherry was here too, but she’s not going to fulfill books. So I asked my 13-year-old, “Will you help me fulfill these?” And he said, “No, not really. Seems like a lot of work.” So I asked myself, “Do I wait two weeks?” Some people had ordered what a month and a half, two months prior for these books and it didn’t feel great to wait another couple of weeks to fulfill it. And I asked myself, “Do I try to hire someone on Craigslist? Do I try to find a local college kid? Do I just wait and not fulfill these yet?” There are all these options. And one afternoon Sherry went to trapeze as she’s apt to do. For those who don’t know she does a lot of circus training. That’s her hobby. I sat down and I thought, “You know what? I’m going to fulfill maybe 50 of the orders just to see how hard it is and if I can get a system down, I’ll convince my 13-year-old to help me with it.” And so I sat down and I massaged the CSV. Man, it was like 30 minutes just doing that to get the CSV out of Squarespace and get it to work, and the shipping software that I’m using. So I’m messing around 30, 45 minutes. Finally, I do it bulk prints, a bunch of labels. So then I’m sitting there and I think I was watching YouTube or I was listening to podcasts and I was like, “I have all these labels and I have all these envelopes and these books. I can totally just listen to it. It’s like doing the dishes. It’s just a rote thing. You pack, pack, pack. I was even writing notes if someone will say in Minnesota or California since I’ve lived there. I was like, “Hey, California represent.” It was a fun thing and I was able to write notes on it and say, “Hey, see on the Twitters.” I’m packing these books and before I knew it I was maybe 90 minutes in and I had packed up 50 books. But still had a bunch more address labels. Maybe I was a couple hours in. I realized this isn’t fun per se, but this feels good to get this done. And is this the best use of my time? Can’t I pay someone two or $3 to pack these books? In a perfect world, yes. But the way it was working out, it was going to be hassle to do it, right? Because again, lack of assistant, lack of 17-year-old. I could go try to hire someone. It’s a one-off job on and on and on. It’s that thing of do I just do what it takes to ship these books? And so that’s what I did. Honestly, at a certain point my back started hurting because you’re doing the same thing over and over. It took me about five hours, all told start to finish to get everything packed, labeled, boxed up for the post office. And during that time I thought a lot about how I used to do this when I worked construction. As an electrician, I used to prefab things where you prefabricate, you attach a box to some MC cable and you make a hundred of these. And then when they’re out in the field, they can just grab one. It’s a certain length. It’s marked with tape and they don’t have to do it on the job site and you are sitting in a warehouse doing it and so you can do it very efficiently. It’s just fabrication, right? It’s like manufacturing of something. And that’s what this felt like. It was a rote process. And while I didn’t necessarily enjoy doing it, nor do I consider it something I would do again, nor do I consider it the best use of my time. I just did what it took to get it done. And I’m going to be honest, a lot of the founders that I see that succeed, they just do what it takes to get done. Now, maybe they’re not packing and shipping books. Again, I’m not saying, “As a startup founder, you need to be willing to pack and ship books because that’s not the point of this.” The point is that even though today I run two successful companies, we’ve raised $42 million. We’ve invested in 130 SaaS companies. MicroConf has this incredible audience. Even though all that’s in place, I’m never above taking the trash out. I’m never above doing the dishes. I’m never above packing books when it needs to get done. I’m going to be honest, so many of the founders that I see who are wildly successful, they do what it takes to get it done. When I look at what Jason Cohen was doing in the early days of WP Engine, now this is 12 years ago now, he just did what it took. He didn’t say, “I’m above that or since I’m a third time founder I’m not going to do grunt work.” He did the grunt work. He had the conversations,.he validated the idea. He wrote some code before he hired developers. He did what it took. When I watched Heath Shaw do his most recent effort, FYI, he was grinding on that trying to find product market fit for a couple years. When I look at TinySeed founders who are building these incredible multimillion dollar businesses and we have quite a few of them now, I won’t say every single one of them we know is willing to just grind and go all in and do what it takes. But a lot of them are. And this is not something that you have to do every day, all day for the rest of your life. This is not 60 hour weeks, 12 months a year, but this is not five hours packing books every Sunday, five hours checking your support queue every Sunday, five hours writing content every Sunday. But does this need to get done once in a while? Probably in the life of a business, especially when you are at idea stage and you’re just grinding, and you think, “I don’t know if I really want to do this.” If you’re not sure if you want to do it, you probably shouldn’t because I talk about how success is made up of hard work, luck and skill. Luck is something you really can’t control directly. Skills are something that you can build over time. But the other thing that you can really control is putting in hard work. And when I think about the nights and weekends that I put in when I was getting started and how I didn’t really want to do that, but the end goal of quitting that day job and having enough income that I didn’t have to beholden to someone else and I didn’t have a boss, it was worth it. So when I would stay up till 1:00 AM, I’d get off at five or 6:00 PM. I’d come home, I’d eat dinner. And if Sherry was out, I would stay up till 1:00 AM working on stuff, working on website copy, writing some code, doing support, and then I’d get up and go to work. Did I do that endlessly for years? No, I didn’t. But being willing to sometimes just do what it takes to sometimes work a little harder than maybe you’re used to is the quality that I think more entrepreneurs need to embrace. I can imagine someone listening to this thinking hustle culture, work all the time. Again, that is not what I’m saying. But at certain times, there’s a time and a place where you have to buckle down and do what it takes to be successful. I hope you enjoyed the three topics for today about doing what it takes, not listening to a customer, always listening to your customers and paying attention to the problem customers have not solutions. I’ll tell you a problem I have. I don’t have 100 five star reviews on Amazon or Audible. If you have read The SaaS Playbook and you think It’s worthy of a five star review, I would really appreciate it. If you go to amazon.com or amazon.co.uk or Audible, wherever you bought the book and leave a five star Review, it would mean a lot to me and it helps me tremendously in being able to spread the word about the book. I believe The SaaS Playbook across the Kickstarter and all the other sales through the website and the Amazon ecosystem, and Apple Books, and all that, I believe it’s north of 5,000 copies sold now. I think it might be north of 5,500 if I’m honest, which is pretty dang good for a self-published book. I’m looking to continue to push that forward. I truly appreciate any support you’ve lent. I know many of you listening to this back the Kickstarter or have since bought the book from saasplaybook.com or Audible or Amazon. And again, I’m on a drive to get to 100 reviews on Amazon and Audible. I truly appreciate any help you can lend. With that, I’ll wrap up this episode. I will talk to you in one week. This is Rob Walling signing off from episode 680.","PublishedAt":"September 26, 2023","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-680-problems-vs-solutions-doing-what-it-takes-and-more-listener-questions-a-rob-solo-adventure"},{"Title":"Episode 679.5 | The Future of MicroConf (7 Announcements!)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 679.5 | The Future of MicroConf (7 Announcements!)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t07:13\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 07:13 | Recorded on September 18, 2023\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 679.5, Rob shares seven announcements about the future of MicroConf in the upcoming year. \n\n\n\nWhether you’re a long-time supporter or a new member of our crew of misfits, you know we’re all about empowering bootstrapped SaaS entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nFor nearly a decade, we’ve been fueling the permissionless entrepreneurship movement that’s gripped founders worldwide – and we’re nowhere close to finished.\n\n\n\nOur next big leap is coming, and you won’t want to miss it.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get the inside scoop, and to keep up to date as we roll out all of these offerings, head over to https://www.futureofmicroconf.com/.\n\n\n\nTopics we cover: \n\n\n\n\n2:03 – MicroConf Connect has leveled up, and is accepting new signups\n\n\n\n2:41 – The return of The State of Independent SaaS Report\n\n\n\n3:21 – Community voting for MicroConf Local 2024 cities\n\n\n\n3:50 – New course launch, “Starting Up From Idea to Traction”\n\n\n\n4:21 – MicroConf co-founder matching coming soon\n\n\n\n4:58 – Host your team retreat with MicroConf’s Team Sync\n\n\n\n5:28 – MicroConf Platinum Events for an exclusive and intimate experience\n\n\n\n\nLinks from the Show: \n\n\n\n\nSign up to get notified for MicroConf updates\n\n\n\nMicroConf Connect\n\n\n\nRob Walling (@robwalling) | X\n\n\n\nMicroConf (@MicroConf) | X\n\n\n\nMicroConf YouTube Channel\n\n\n\nMicroConf On Air Podcast\n\n\n\nMicroConf Mastermind Matching\n\n\n\nState of Independent SaaS (2022)\n\n\n\nDemandMaven\n\n\n\nMicroConf Local\n\n\n\nTinySeed\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about starting or scaling a software business that you’d like for us to cover, please submit your question for an upcoming episode.

This is one of these 0.5 episodes where we insert announcements and things that are not normal startups for the rest of us full episodes, we tend to drop these now and again on a Thursday. Today’s episode is all about the future of MicroConf, where I make seven announcements about new things that we are doing in the upcoming year. I’m really excited about what we are up to over the next 12 months. The last time we did a future of MicroConf announcement was four years ago. In 2019, we announced the launch of MicroConf Connect, of our YouTube channel, of our video vault. We announced MicroConf locals. There were several other super interesting things in that announcement, all of which have come to fruition. So when we make this proclamation and we look ahead and like Babe Ruth, we call our shot of what’s going to happen in 2024, I hope that you can get excited about this as well. Everything we’ve developed here and are planning on launching is from feedback from folks just like you, from podcast listeners, from folks in MicroConf Connect, from folks at our in-person events. So without further introduction, I’m going to roll the audio. It’s seven announcements packed in to five and a half minutes. And if you have any questions, comments, or thoughts once you’ve heard them, you can head to Twitter, @robwalling and @microconf. Whether you’ve been part of MicroConf for years or you’ve just recently joined our crew of misfits, you know that we’re all about helping you build and scale your SaaS company. From our humble start as a 100 person event in Las Vegas to where we stand today impacting more than a hundred thousand bootstrap founders around the world through MicroConf Connect Mastermind Matching, our in-person events and all of our other offerings, MicroConf has played a huge role in igniting a global movement for software entrepreneurs. And in 2024, we’re kicking it up a notch. Today I have seven announcements for you, so let’s dive in. First up, big news for our online community, MicroConf Connect. We’ve leveled it up and are reopening the doors to new members. MicroConf Connect is our online community and virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping one another, discussing wins, challenges, and how to grow faster. A couple months ago we paused new signups to improve the platform based on your requests and the good news, applications reopen next week. The wait list is already 1500 strong and with MicroConf Connect 2.0, we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks, like weekly coworking, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library and more. Announcement number two is that the state of independent SaaS report is back. We took last year off because frankly between 2020 and 2022, not a ton had changed with the companies that we were serving. But the bootstrap SaaS landscape has since been shaken up by the rise of remote work, no code and AI. This has fueled a new wave of entrepreneurs and created new ways for existing startups to level up. So with that, I’m excited to roll out our completely revamped state of independent SaaS survey and report. Teaming up with DemandMaven, we’re going to offer go-to benchmarks for the bootstraps SaaS world. Over 2000 founders have taken the survey to date, and this year I hope to add your experience to the report. Next, we’re putting the power in your hands to bring a MicroConf local in-person event to your city. Until now, we’ve picked locations based on our assessment of which cities could use an in-person event, and in 2024, you get to decide. We’re going to run a community voting campaign to help choose which cities we visit next. With almost 100,000 entrepreneurs globally engaged with MicroConf, your city shot at hosting the next MicroConf local means you’ll need to rally founders in your community to get the most votes. Announcement number four is our debut course, Starting Up From Idea to Traction. It’s designed to kickstart you on your entrepreneurial journey as you launch your SaaS product. I know that many of you are stuck in startup limbo full of ideas, but unsure how to get started. And this video course tackles exactly that guiding you through idea generation, validation and finding early traction. Whether you’re a first timer, a pivoter, or a serial entrepreneur, this course aims to help you take your next SaaS venture to escape velocity. Also, in 2024, we’re going to help you find a co-founder. Almost every day we hear from folks in the MicroConf community who are looking for a co-founder. We know that finding the right partner in crime can be a make or break moment for your startup. Whether you’re a tech wizard with zero marketing chops or a sales pro looking for someone to build your product, we will help you find someone that compliments your skill sets, your goals, and your personality. Drawing on years of experience observing co-founder hits and misses, we’re designing a data-driven matching service to help you find your ideal co-founder because we know that the right partnership can have a huge impact on your success. Announcement number six is Team Sync by MicroConf. We’re hosting an event where you can host your team retreat. We’re merging two needs into one in-person event. So first, you’re going to soak up best practices for managing a remote team, curated by our team of experts in remote work and second retreat into your own team huddles. We’ll handle logistics while you focus on strategy and connection. Ideal for remote SaaS teams of five or more, this will be a game changer for team coherence and productivity. Next up, we’re going to start hosting exclusive intimate experiences called MicroConf Platinum Events. Imagine getting tailored advice about selling your company while sitting poolside with 15 other seven or eight figure founders or boosting your enterprise conversions during a trek to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. We’re rolling out small curated experiences that combine unique settings with laser-focused business goals, meet like-minded, high achieving founders and experts ready to elevate your game. And of course, we’re going to keep running our annual flagship conferences, MicroConf US and MicroConf Europe, as well as MicroConf Remote, which is our online conference that focuses on early stage SaaS marketing in the fall and SaaS sales in the spring. And of course, we also have our Mastermind Matching podcast and YouTube channel. And if your SaaS is growing, but you’re looking for the perfect amount of funding and mentorship to help take you to the next level, TinySeed is our investment fund and startup accelerator aimed specifically at bootstrap SaaS founders. So there it is. That’s your glimpse into the next era of MicroConf. I know I’m biased, but I firmly believe that our community of misfits is one of the best in the world. My team has spent the last several months working nonstop to nail down this pretty incredible lineup focused on helping you be more successful faster. I hope you’re as excited as I am to see these play out over the next year. I can’t wait to continue helping you find success on your founder journey in 2024. All of these programs will be launching over the course of the next year. So head over to futureofmicroconf.com to sign up to be notified as they launch.","PublishedAt":"September 21, 2023","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-679-5-the-future-of-microconf-7-announcements"},{"Title":"Episode 679 | Mock Features, A Failed Launch, Becoming a Freelancer, and More Listener Questions (A Rob Solo Adventure)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 679 | Mock Features, A Failed Launch, Becoming a Freelancer, and More Listener Questions (A Rob Solo Adventure)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26:27\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 26:27 | Recorded on September 19, 2023\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 679, join Rob Walling for another solo adventure where he answers listener questions.

You launch to the next few 100 people. I’ve done it myself. I’ve seen other folks do these phased launches. And that is, I would say a much, much more optimal way to bring a product to market. Welcome To this episode of Startups For the Rest of Us. I’m Rob Walling, and this is the podcast where we talk about building amazing, bootstrapped, and mostly bootstrapped companies to change our little corner of the world. We believe that you don’t need venture capitalists to start your company. We’re not anti venture capital, but we’re anti the narrative that the only way to start a tech company is to raise buckets of funding. This week I’m answering listener questions on topics ranging from building mock features. It’s a really interesting Twitter thread I want to talk about in this episode, how to recover from a failed launch, creating content for your SaaS tool that is outside of your expertise, and more. Before we dive into that, I’m on a mission to get to 105 star ratings on Amazon for my new book, The SaaS Playbook, Build a Multimillion Dollar Startup Without Venture Capital. If you have bought the book and you enjoyed it and you think it deserves five stars, it would be amazing if you could go to amazon.com and whether it’s dot com or whether it’s your country’s extension of Amazon, a five star rating and maybe a comment, would really help me out. I kind of chuckle because as I record this, The SaaS Playbook is the number one new release in the venture capital category of Amazon. I think because it has the word venture capital in the subtitle because the subtitle of the book is Build a Multimillion Dollar Startup Without Venture Capital. And the book has already been a number one new release and bestseller in several different categories ranging from entrepreneurship to, there was one really esoteric one that I don’t remember, but it was kind of a subcategory of another tech entrepreneurship thing, and today, it’s venture capital. So again, would really appreciate it if you could potentially give me a review there. And one more thing – We’ve recently re-opened the doors for our online community, MicroConf Connect. MicroConf Connect is our virtual hallway track. It’s a vibrant community of SaaS founders helping each other and discussing wins, challenges, and frankly how to grow faster. A couple months ago we paused new sign-ups to improve the platform based on your requests. With MicroConf Connect 2.0 we’re rolling out three membership tiers packed with new perks like weekly co-working, exclusive discounts, a searchable content library, and more. Whether you’ve been a member of Connect or not, you really should check it out, Microconfconnect.com. And with that, let’s dive into listener questions. My first one is not a question, but a comment from listener Tom who is commenting on episode 671 all about hard work, luck, and skill, where I talked a lot about how success is a combination of these three things, hard work, luck, and skill. Tom says, “Just a thank you for your podcast keeping me going, slapping me upside the head sometimes to keep focused and persevere.” And thanks for that note, Tom. I always love hearing from listeners even if they don’t have a question and they just want to thank the show for keeping them motivated. Because that’s how I think about it too, I don’t think of it as Rob is keeping me motivated. It’s the show. Startups for the Rest of Us is its own entity, its own flywheel, that keeps going every week and it delivers value back to me in terms of motivation to keep shipping and I hope that it delivers value back to you in terms of strategies and tactics to implement to grow your startup faster in terms of motivation and inspiration. Whether it’s me talking about solo topics or me interviewing someone on the show, I try to bring a variety of topics and thoughts and concepts to the show to keep it feeling new and to help you get where you’re going faster. So thanks for that comment, Tom. The next topic I want to cover is from Twitter from Ab Advany, and we will link up this thread in the show notes, but I was impacted by the genius of Ab’s approach and we were talking about it in the TinySeed Slack and several people commented about how they’re either doing this or would consider doing this, and I think it’s a really clever hack. The tweets go like this, “Mock features for B2B SaaS. It’s one of the techniques I’ve used in the last 10 years to sell $6 million worth of software licenses. When you were selling software above $1,000 a month, there is a weird dynamic happening that doesn’t occur with lower pricing.” And Ab continues, “We would build mock features that the buyer would demand before purchase, but were almost never used by the super user or end user of the product.” Let me give you a very specific example, and this is me chiming in. I used to call these checklist features. So when we were growing Drip, people would say, “Do you have split testing because we need to split test everything?” And eventually we built split testing and 1% of our users used it, but everyone thought they wanted it. Aspirational features, or checklist features, is what Ab is talking about. Ab continues, “A buyer who wanted to buy the software for $10,000 a month on a two-year license, so if you do the math on that, that’s a quarter of a million dollars. This buyer requested that there be an ability to build a report generator with 20 different kinds of filters, and we said we can do that, but we only built it as a mock feature in the following way. We added a button deep inside the software that only specific customers could see. When clicking it, they could request a report with all the filters. After submitting, we showed it will take 48 to 72 hours to generate. You will receive an email when it’s finished.” This is so great. “But guess how many times the feature was used in the two years the customer licensed our software? Zero, nada. We have built more than 50 of these mock features in the last 10 years. Some were requested and we would then manually execute them, but most were never used. These kinds of mock features only work if the buyer isn’t the same person as the end user or the super user. Most buyers don’t know their own users and come up with ridiculous demands during the sales process. Mock features are an easy way to increase your closing rate.” So I really appreciated that thread. I think it’s a great idea, and again, it doesn’t work when you’re building software for $100 a month or when you’re selling to the end user. But if you are selling to some corporate procurement person, Ab is 100% correct. I’ve seen it myself. Ridiculous checklist requirements are very common, and I thought this idea of building mock features was too smart not to share on the show. My first question question of the day is from Laszlo Kiss about how to recover from a failed launch.  Laszlo Kiss:Hi Rob, this is Laszlo. I previously asked you about better to further development game platform or get into the SaaS business. I followed your suggestion and my own feelings and began to concentrate on my SaaS project named Real Feedback. It’s an AI powered user feedback chatbot. However, I made some mistakes with the launch. It gained significant traction initially, but I launched too soon, so the product wasn’t very stable yet and the pricing plan weren’t properly figured out. Since then, I’ve improved the product and that fired my first users, but the initial hype has completely disappeared. Do you have any strategies for recovering from a failed launch like I had? I would really appreciate any advice on relaunching and regaining momentum after messing up the initial release. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.  Rob Walling:As always, voicemails and video questions go to the top of the stack. Thanks for this question, Laszlo. It’s tough to have a failed launch like that. It’s not uncommon. Most of us don’t have product market fit. None of us really have product market fit before we launch, and that’s why the way around this is to start marketing the day you start coding such that you have a list of 500, 1,000, 10,000 people interested in your app such that you don’t have to do the public launch until your product is ready, until you have an idea that you do have some product market fit. And so if you’d had that launch list, you could have trickled out to 50 people or 300 people. In a phased launch, you get them in, you realize, “Oh, pricing’s screwed up, don’t have the features.” And then you correct that, you launch to the next few hundred people. I’ve done it myself. I’ve seen other folks do these phased launches. And that is, I would say a much, much more optimal way to bring a product to market rather than try to do the big product hunt, Reddit Hacker News launch where this is what you run into, and now you find yourself in a more challenging situation. I’ll say it’s certainly salvageable. The way I would think about it is, I now have a better product and I now have my pricing dialed in more and I’m ready to take it to market. And so, if there were other launch avenues that I could tap into, let’s say you didn’t do a product not launched, then now I would launch it. Alternatively, just market it like every other SaaS product. People think that a launch is so important and in fact, so many of the products that we see being successful had mediocre launches at best, or maybe they didn’t do some big launch. They really just started cold calling, cold emailing, they started content, SEO, integrations, partnerships, all the blocking and tackling that it takes to grow a SaaS app. So can a launch get you a few customers, a few dozen customers, a few 100 customers? Maybe. But you don’t need that to build an incredible 6, 7, 8 figure SaaS company. So I wouldn’t take it too hard in terms of the launch failing. I would chalk it up as a learning experience. I hope that folks listening to this podcast will learn from it and I would get to work on marketing the product. One last thought on this is with Drip, we did do a Drip 2.0 launch, because the 1.0 launch happened in, say, November of 2013, and we peaked at 8 or 9,000 MRR and then plateaued because to your point, our pricing wasn’t figured out, our features were not there, we didn’t have product market fit, and we spent the next nine months agonizingly moving towards product market fit, and eventually we had it in August of 2014. And I wanted to do essentially another launch to the world, and so I called it Drip 2.0 and I described our journey. I described how we built something people didn’t want early on, and then how we found product market fit and how we saw trial to paid accelerating and our churn plummeted and it was very obvious that we had it. And so, I launched Drip 2.0 and I hit the product hunt and our original launch email list and, frankly, my personal email list. And all the places that you would do a launch, I hit them again and I said, “This is Drip 2.0. Here’s what I learned and here’s why this is interesting.” I’m really relaunching something that’s not totally different, but that now is a much, much better product, and something that you’re more likely to be interested in. So that’s another alternative, is you can do this like 2.0 launch or revamp launch where you say, “Oh, remember how we launched and that thing wasn’t that great? Well, it is great now because we learned a bunch and encourage people to give another try.” My next question is from Zach asking for advice for a consumer vitamin product. “Hey Rob, I’ve fallen in love with a product to scratch my own itch. It’s absolutely a vitamin.” So you’ve heard me say aspirin and vitamins, aspirins solve a desperate pain point and vitamins are nice to haves. “It’s also consumer facing, not for businesses. It’s completely free for now. Maybe I can add display ads if enough people use it. I know there are a lot of red flags here. The early feedback is pretty positive, but some mixed feelings. Do you have any advice for navigating a consumer facing vitamin product? My itch has been scratched, but it’s hard to know how much energy to put into a product like this.” This is kind of within my policy of not answering questions like this on the podcast. And I don’t mean to be glib about it, but I can’t help you, because consumer facing products are a completely different world. I have owned a couple of them and they are not in my wheelhouse and they’re not something I enjoy dealing with. The churn is way too high. If you’re not Netflix or Disney, they’re very, very, very difficult to grow. And no matter how much I say this, people continue to do it and that’s fine. But this show, my expertise, I just can’t help you. And especially if it’s consumer vitamin. Are there some that are successful? Have I seen some get huge traction because of virality or because they figured out Instagram ads? Of course. In your shoes, I would not ask me. I would look for an expert on that topic. Is there a podcast, YouTube channel on someone who builds consumer vitamin products, because they’re going to know so much more about it than I will. And I have kind of this, it’s a little bit jokey stance on this podcast, but I’m kind of serious about it. I’m not going to answer questions about two-sided marketplaces about bootstrapping them unless you already have one side of the marketplace, because my answer is just don’t. And same thing with a consumer vitamin product. I can’t give you advice, because my advice is don’t do it. It’s scratch your own itch. That’s great. Don’t put any more time into it and start a B2B SaaS. Do the stair-step approach. Do one of the other approaches that I’ve seen be so much more repeatable and work for so many more people rather than going down this path that I have seen fail for myself and hundreds if not thousands of other aspiring founders. So I do appreciate the question, Zach, and obviously I wish you the best of luck, and I’m guessing there is a chance that you can make this work, but unfortunately I’m not the person to weigh in on this because I just can’t help you like I can with B2B SaaS. My next question is from Jordan Riddle.  Jordan Riddle:Hey Rob, this is Jordan Riddle. I’m in Columbia, South Carolina. Just want to say thanks for everything. I’ve been following you for a while and it’s been really helpful. My question is about coming up with organic content for my SaaS tool. So I’ve created a tool that’s not really in the space where I have worked before. So I’m struggling with creating content because I don’t know a whole lot about this space, but I still feel like it’s a useful SaaS tool. So what I want to know is how you just juggle creating content and where the best bang for your buck is of coming up with organic stuff, if I should do it myself, if I should get a part-time job and then hire a writer to do it for me. Just looking for some insight on what’s the best way to go about that. Again, thanks for everything and I look forward to hearing from you.  Rob Walling:Thanks for the question, Jordan. It’s a good one. I’m sure it’s something other people have run into. So first off, I want to say this is the challenge of starting a tool catering to folks that are outside your profession. Now, I know a lot of folks who do it and are successful. Some of the approaches they take is they don’t necessarily create content, they do cold outreach, they go to in-person events and trade shows, integrations and partnerships. It’s the 20 B2B SaaS marketing approaches I outline in the SaaS Playbook. And they execute on all of those. They don’t do the content and SEO plays because they aren’t an expert. So that’s one way to think about it. Another is to hire a writer, as you said. You said get a part-time job so that you can hire a writer. So it depends on what your financial situation is, but certainly if you’re catering to accountants or salon owners, you can find an accountant or a salon owner with some spare time or someone with knowledge of these topics, whether it’s on Upwork or a writer’s marketplace, and you can find folks with expertise in these fields. Another option that I’ve seen is to bring a co-founder on for whether you have the developer entrepreneur, then you have the subject matter expert, and that subject matter expert has that expertise in accounting, bookkeeping, or in interior design. And that is a relatively common founder combination that I see in the MicroConf and TinySeed communities. So I guess to summarize, you have a couple options. One is don’t create content, just do all the other marketing approaches or just pick one other frankly and execute on that to where you don’t need the expertise to create the content. The second one is, yes, hire a writer with subject matter expertise, not a generic writer who’s going to have to learn it like you would. And I would not encourage you to, say, use ChatGPT or other AI because I think without the expertise yourself, it’s going to write really bland content. Because the content I see around topics that I know and understand, I can see through it pretty quickly. I think the AI generated stuff, it just isn’t there yet. And so if you don’t have that last 20% to get it, again, it’s 80/20, Where AI can maybe get you 80% of the way there. But if you don’t have the last 20% yourself, I think it’s a tough road. And if you’re competing against other people who actually have the expertise and are trying to rank for these SEO terms or folks who are doing the content pop where they’re trying to get virality on the Hacker News, the Reddits and such, I just don’t think you’re going to do it with AI generated content at this point without human involvement. I will say that one of the very first businesses that I built, in fact several of the businesses I built, I didn’t need content for. And we see a good chunk of TinySeed companies, which is a sample size that I have, or maybe it’s just all my investments. I think I have 151 B2B SaaS investments. There are a lot of them that don’t use content and they use the other marketing approaches. And so, I wouldn’t necessarily say that that is the one way to go. If you can make it work, it’s a great scalable, sustainable flywheel to build, and there’s a reason a lot of people go in on it, but it’s not a hard requirement to build a great company. So thanks for that question. I hope it was helpful. My last two questions are a little different than the ones I often answer, but I was intrigued by them. This first one’s about being an employee of an early stage startup and the last one’s about consulting and contracting, which I think a lot of us think about, especially early stage founders who maybe are trying to quit the day job and get to working full-time on their startup. I think hearing more about these topics can be helpful. So this first question is from Tyler and he asks, “I’m just joining a seed stage startup with a lot of traction. I’ll be basically the third full-time hire, and I have a sense that the business is looking for an acquisition during my tenure, which is likely if they’ve raised funding. It’s a small engineering team. It’s just me. I’m excited about what an acquisition means for my equity and also for my resume. And I’m also curious about what a typical acquisition looks like for a small team of a recently acquired SaaS. As anything in business or software goes, I’m sure the answer is it depends, but I’d appreciate it if you could lend insight on this situation. Say a small company gets acquired and has a solo engineer with equity, does that engineer usually get hired to the acquirer? Do they ever get contractually obligated to stick around for equity to vest, i.e. to help with a smooth transition, or is it usually a clean break? Are the single trigger/double trigger clauses the only mechanism at play here? Or do businesses have some other way to determine what is required of the team? Personally, I’m excited to experience any outcome. I’m just curious how you would conceptualize your future if you were me and assuming a desired acquisition actually happens, of course.” So yeah, I think it’s an interesting question. Of course it depends, but realistically, in almost all of the acquisitions that I see, maybe it is truly all, but in 99 plus percent, the acquirer wants the team. The acquirer wants the team. It’s very unusual that they just are acquiring technology, and unless you’ve built some amazing novel tech, the team is one of the most valuable pieces of it. So the first question, does the engineer usually get hired to the acquirer? The answer is usually yes. Do they ever get contractually obligated to stick around for equity divest? So that’s going to depend on your equity agreement with your current employer. When I have issued equity in the past, I have made it fully vest if we were acquired, because I wanted my people to own that equity or own those options or be able to purchase the options when the acquisition came through such that they were not compelled to stick around by agreements we had already made, but that the acquirer, if they wanted them to stick around, could make them an offer for additional stock options or additional incentives to stick around. So I have heard of founders being contractually obligated to stick around in order for equity to vest. It’s often called a key person clause where in order to get the full purchase price, you stick around for a year or two years or three years, but usually, not in all cases, usually what I’ve seen is that for employees or engineers, they are offered a new grant of stock options in the acquiring entity and then that starts vesting over usually four years. And so that really is the motivation to stick around. It obviously depends on your specific agreement and how your options are vesting, and if they don’t have that acceleration clause and you have options that are in the middle of vesting, let’s say you’re two years into your four year, I suppose the acquirer could elect to have all of your stock vest instantly and then issue you new, or they could just say, “Well, we’ll roll that into the acquiring company.” Could that happen? Yeah. Have I seen it happen? Not a lot. I also think the size of the acquisition is going to dramatically impact this. If you’re part of a company, as you said, where you’re the only engineer, it’s going to be different than if there are 1,000 engineers. But thanks for that question, Tyler. I hope it was helpful. Last question of the day comes from Jay Lee asking about consulting for software engineers.  Jay Lee:Hey Rob, huge congrats in your new book, The SaaS Playbook and thanks always for your podcast. So my name is Jay, I’m from Southern California, and I had a quick question about consulting. So it’s not about SaaS, but you do mention consulting quite a lot, especially related to your early days. As someone who is a software engineer and my background is from big tech, I know pretty much nothing about consulting. I know it’s about helping people and giving advice, but what is consulting? Could you give us a one-on-one breakdown? How do you find your clients? Do you just start in your network? What’s the pay like? Can a junior engineer or a mid-level engineer also be a consultant? And generally things like that, because I would really like to know what my options are aside from just engineering. Thanks so much.  Rob Walling:Thanks for the congrats on the book, Jay. So when I use the term consulting, really I did some consulting. I did a lot of contracting. And the way I think about it is if you’re a software developer, contracting is where you’re writing code for dollars per hour. And so originally I was writing code for $60 an hour, and then I started blogging and making a name for myself around 2005. Suddenly I had people coming directly to me. I could go get retail rates of $100 an hour, and then it was 125. And then I think by the time I stopped contracting, consulting, it was 120, 150 an hour. Now, if you go to an agency these days and you’re going to contract for them and just write code dollars for hours, basically you could call it you’re a 1099 contractor, the rates are going to vary, but you’re going to get lower rates if you go through an agency versus finding clients yourself. And you’re also going to get a lower rate if you go onto a marketplace like an Upwork. But Upwork can be a great source for finding new clients. So I often use consulting and contracting interchangeably. They aren’t exactly the same. I think consulting is more about giving advice and not implementing, and contracting is usually about someone who is doing the work. It’s a software developer who is writing code. And I did a bit of both, but certainly what paid the bills was contracting. And then Jay, you asked about how do you find your clients? Do you start with your network? Yes and yes. What’s the pay? It depends on where you live. It depends on the kind of work you’re doing. Honestly, you can charge $10 an hour if you live in the Philippines, and you might charge 150, $200 an hour if you live in Los Angeles. Can a junior engineer or a mid-level engineer be a consultant? Yes, they can. I think to start off with, you want to find people who need software development or web development or whatever your expertise is. They need help with that. And this might be big companies, it might be small companies, or it might be someone who’s looking on Upwork to have you do a little one-off project. One-off projects sound amazing and like you’re going to have a bunch of freedom, but realistically it’s so feast or famine. I used to work project basis and I would make $15,000 in one month and then I’d make $0 in the next month, and that wasn’t a great feeling. And I would be stressed of when’s my next project coming along versus if you can find someone who can put you to work for 10, 20, 30 or full-time every week. Honestly, you’re less of a consultant contractor and you kind of become, you’re not an employee per se, but it becomes more of a consistent income for you. That’s what I think of as being self-employed, you’re not actually in control of your own schedule, but you’re not an employee. It’s kind of being in between. There’s employed, there is entrepreneur, and there’s being an investor. Those are the four links up the chain. And being employed, we all know what that means. Self-employed is when you’re selling dollars for hours, whether you’re consulting, whether you’re a contractor. If you’re doing it individually and let’s say you’re running a full service organization where you have 30 developers working under you and you are now just doing sales and operating the company. That’s when you’re an entrepreneur, when you’re leveraging other people’s time to generate revenue. If you’re still leveraging your own time as a consultant or a contractor, that’s when you are self-employed. And obviously being a SaaS founder, that’s where I would say, “Oh, you’re an entrepreneur there because now you’re leveraging technology in order to make more money than you could make by charging dollars for hours.” So the only reason I’m weighing in on this is because I did this myself and I moved from W2 employment to being a freelancer/contractor/consultant, which I’ll just say they’re different, but they’re kind of all the same thing for the purpose of this conversation. And that helped me transition to having products full-time because I was stair stepping on nights and weekends while I was doing this. And then I was able to dial back my contract work from five days to four days to three days as my product scaled. And it was a nice balance for me where I didn’t have a boss, per se, I did have a client or two, but it was a good in-between for me. And that doesn’t work for everyone. I hear some people say they just can’t manage it all and it’s too hard to work on your own products that aren’t really making much money when you can bill $150 every hour for 40 hours a week. It is hard to say no to that contract work, because the money is “easy” compared to building your software product or building up revenue for a SaaS product. So there are trade-offs there. I’m guessing there have to be better podcasts or YouTube channels for this particular question. If you really want to get into, “Hey, how do I transition from full-time work to being a contract or consulting developer?” I don’t know any off the top of my head, because it’s just not an interest I have these days. But I would certainly look around whether you ask on Twitter, whether you head to Apple Podcasts or YouTube to look for folks, like What is the Startups for the Rest of Us equivalent show for folks who are in your situation and looking to get into that self-employed contractor freelance game. So thanks for the question, Jay. It was a good one. As I said, it’s a little different than I often answer on this show, but I felt like a lot of folks might be thinking about the same thing. And with that, I’ll remind you that I am on a quest to get 105 star Amazon reviews for the SaaS Playbook and would really appreciate if you loved the book and you feel like it’s five star worthy, heading into Amazon and giving it that five stars. Thanks for joining me this week and every week.

Think about how to potentially mitigate it or just live with the risk and realize, “This is not a 20-year business. This is a business that’s going to get me to the next step to where I could potentially get away from the platform risk.” Welcome to Startups For The Rest Of Us. This is the podcast where we talk about building companies that are unlikely to change the whole world, but very likely to change our little corner of it. I’m Rob Walling, I’m your host and this week I’m going to be answering listener questions. Before I dive into those, I wanted to ask if you have read the SaaS Playbook, my most recent book, saasplaybook.com. If you could go to Amazon and leave a five star rating for me, the ratings go a long way towards helping other people discover the book and they’re a strong signal to folks who may have never heard of me and are considering buying the book based on the name and the cover and a recommendation. And in fact, it looks like there’s one or two folks who have something out for me because I believe I have a two star review that says something to the effect of, “This book is really light on actionable information,” and I chuckle because it’s just a very dense book and it’s full of self-promotion and the book fell apart. “I got the book and it just fell apart at my house.” And I’m thinking to myself, if I knew who this person was, I would just send them another copy. But I genuinely think they’re either out to troll me directly or just in general are trolling Amazon authors. I don’t know. If the book falls apart, email Amazon and they’ll send you a new book. But with that said, it would be amazing if I could get a few more five star reviews and help out the average on this new book. Before we dive into the episode, I have two announcements for you. The first is that TinySeed applications for our fall 2023 accelerator batch will be open from September 4th to the 16th. We are funding companies in two batches. We have our Americas and our EMEA batch, that’s Europe, Middle East and Africa. And if you have at least $500 in MRR and you are looking for the perfect amount of funding as well as world-class mentorship, you can’t get anywhere else, and a tight-knit community, unlike any you’ve been part of, head to tinyseed.com/apply. If it’s from September 4th to the 16th, applications will be open and you can apply there. It usually takes about 10 minutes. If they’re not open, you can enter your email to be notified when we open the doors. I hope to see your application. My second announcement is that while some of you might have spent the summer vacationing or spending time at the lake, our team at MicroConf has been gearing up for one of the biggest announcements we’ve ever made. The last time we made a major announcement was in 2019. I don’t want to jinx it, but there are some pretty amazing things coming down the line to help you build, launch and grow your SaaS business. If you want to be the first to hear about it, head over to futureofmicroconf.com and sign up for our announcement event. It’s going to happen on September 14th, 2023. You won’t want to miss it. And with that, let’s dive in to my first listener question.  Speaker 2:Hi Rob. Big fan of the podcast. I have a question for you. I recently made my first SaaS product. I am not a developer myself. I teamed up with a team of student developers. I realize now that I’m in over my head. I didn’t know that so many things could break and that it would be so challenging to maintain a SaaS product over time. I have some early traction in the sense that I have a few people placing test orders and quite a lot of interest, but I want to exit this thing as soon as possible because I’m pretty sure that if I keep it I’m going to drop it and it’s going to break. My question is are there any communities or platforms where you can sell SaaS products that are only half done or what would you do in my situation? Thanks.  Rob Walling:Thanks for the question, Max and for keeping it succinct, Max actually sent a second voicemail that gave me more context, but that really, you don’t need to hear all of that, and he did a really good job of keeping it as a succinct question that I can answer on the show. Probably the only additional piece of information he gave that is necessary for you to understand the problem is the product itself is in Dutch, the market of people who could potentially buy it is obviously a lot smaller than if it was in English. Definitely a tough position Max, and frankly there aren’t any places. Basically you don’t have any value until you have customers or I should say very, very little value. Could I imagine paying a thousand dollars for a code base with a few customers? Maybe. If you found a strategic who really needed this, and again it being in Dutch in that case is a challenge because it really limits who you can sell to, but realistically, products sell based on revenue, traction and growth and until you have that you have nothing. If I were to do a hot take on Twitter, I would say you have zero value until people are paying you money. That’s not totally true, but mostly it is. And I don’t have a great recommendation of a place you can go to sell this, to be honest. What I do like about your question is you talked about how complex it is to build and run a SaaS app and people don’t believe me when I tell them they should stair-step and everyone wants to start a SaaS app and a lot of people run into what you’re running into and I feel your pain and I’m sorry that you’re having to learn this lesson this way. I’m sure it’s tough. I’m sure it’s a hard process for you to be going through. With all that said, the only recommendations I could make in terms of selling this, there are a handful of these side project marketplaces, acquire.com is the big one. You could of course list it there. Do I think you’ll sell it or get any traction? Probably not, but it’s worth it. It’s a marketplace and you can list it at an asking price. There used to be some others. There was 1kprojects.com, sideprojects.com are the other two and I believe one of them acquired the other or merged with the other and it’s a totally different domain name now, and I’m not going to pull up Google and go looking for these, but if you go to Google and search for those domains, you’ll likely find a couple other sites that are small and basically it’s Indie Hackers. It’s usually people who have indie hacked and launched on Product Hunt and they have $200 in MRR and they’re like, “I’m willing to sell this for a few thousand dollars.” Those are the types of marketplaces that I could recommend for this. And of course there’s communities. There’s MicroConf Connect. We actually stopped taking new community members into Connect over the summer as we retooled and revamped some things, but we are going to be relaunching that in the next couple of weeks. Had to microconfconnect.com, if you are interested, you can get on the wait list to hear more about it. But a community like that of other SaaS founders, you could feasibly go in and specifically look if there’s a Dutch channel or I believe there is a buy sell channel in MicroConf Connect where you could bring up this kind of thing and outline what you’re looking for and potentially get feedback or find a buyer. It’s a tough spot to be in. I feel your pain Max and I hope that was helpful. As a reminder, if you want to send a question in to be answered by me and potentially a guest in a future episode, startupswiththerestofus.com and look in the top nav for ask-a-question, audio and video questions go to the top of the stack. Although I will say in this episode, I do want to get to a few text questions since there are so many audio and video questions in the queue, I wanted to sprinkle a couple in. The next question is from Andrew and he says, “Hey Rob, I enjoyed your episode with Tara Reed,” so you can tell how old this text question is. That’s back when Tara and I talked about No-Code, the pros and cons of it. Back to Andrew’s email. “I recently sold my startup and I’m looking to start my next business. I’m not technical and No-Code is intriguing to me. One thing you didn’t seem to address is platform risk. If you build your business on a No-Code platform, what happens if the No-Code platform closes significantly raises prices or changes how it operates?” This is a great point Andrew, and what’s interesting is I believe this email’s almost a year old now. Sorry about that. That’s the backlog we have with text questions. But shortly after that episode with Tara Reed, I actually had a conversation on Twitter where someone else pointed this out as well, that platform risk is such a huge risk with No-Code. And a few months after that I recorded a YouTube video on the MicroConf channel, that’s microconf.com/youtube and we’ll link it up in the show notes, but it’s called The Number One Mistake No-Code SaaS Founders Make. And in it I talk about how Bubble had dramatically raised their prices and people were furious because migrating off of Bubble is really hard. Migrating off a No-Code is really hard. Compared to AWS, not that that’s a breeze, but if you have code that can run on any server, you can move from Heroku to AWS to GCP to Azure to your own homegrown Dell Box sitting in your bedroom connected to a fiber connection, which of course I wouldn’t recommend. But you get the idea. Moving code-code from place to place while it’s a pane is totally doable. No-Code’s not portable as far as I know. There’s no standard. You don’t export to XML or to JSON and move it into another No-Code platform. It’s all proprietary and it has massive platform risk. If they dramatically raise prices as several have done, if they change how they operate, which Airtable does about every month or two, they break, they don’t break it, I’m overstating it, but they break how our podcast and our video production systems work because they changed their top nav and they changed the left nav and they forced us to only have a left nav and we don’t really want to, but it’s No-Code and we can’t do anything. You are 100% at the mercy of the No-Code platform when you are building on it. I appreciate you writing in with that, Andrew, because we did miss it in the initial conversation. Since then have obviously done quite a bit of talking about it, but I did want folks to know, and I should add one other point here, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t build something in No-Code. Platform risk exists in a lot of apps and it certainly exists in the stairs-step approach. And what I don’t say is, “Then don’t do it because there’s some risk.” Realize what you’re getting into and realize the risk is there. Think about how to potentially mitigate it or just live with the risk and realize, “This is not a 20-year business, this is a business that’s going to get me to the next step to where I could potentially get away from the platform risk.” Thanks again for that email Andrew, I appreciate you weighing in. Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

My question is, I’m not from the US, I’m not familiar with any the tax laws and everything there. How do I go about bookkeeping? Just background, just start my own SaaS, just took the plunge recently. Apparently I need a US entity to open a Stripe account, I did that, now I have a Stripe account, but now it’s think about, “What about bookkeeping like taxes in like March or April?” How do I go about it? Do I do it myself? It’s simple enough. Or do I get somebody to do it? And if I get somebody, that would take a chunk of money from my very early stage startup, do you have any suggestions how to go about that one? Thanks.  Rob Walling:This is a question of whether or not you want to take time away from your startup or money away from your startup. And if you don’t have funding and you are on a shoestring budget, paying for a bookkeeper can be a challenge to justify. I’ll admit that in the early stages of say, Drip, I was doing the books, wasn’t the best use of my time, but I just didn’t have the budget to pay someone like Bench. You go to bench.co and it’s 250 to $350 a month for them to do your books. I actually did hire a couple different bookkeepers on Upwork with varying degrees of success. Sometimes I had math errors in my books, other times categorization errors, and I was frustrated with my books for a very long time and eventually I just plunked it down. I actually talked to my CPA, my accountant and he started doing it for I think it was about $180 a month and I just bit the bullet and I moved on and I never looked back. I think in the very early stages of a startup where there’s almost no money coming in and mostly no money going out, signing up for Bench or Xero, which is X-E-R-O, linking up a credit card and a bank account or a Stripe account for that matter and letting most of it auto categorize and going in and spending 20 minutes a month, 10 minutes a month if you really don’t have much going on, I don’t think that’s the end of the world. The thing to be aware of and to be careful of is when that turns into a few hours a month and you’re still justifying to yourself that you should be doing it. By the time it’s complicated enough for you to be spending a chunk of time on it, you should have enough revenue to be able to go and hire a service. And Bench themselves, I’ve heard mixed reviews, I’ve heard some real positive reviews and other people it hasn’t worked for. I think it really does just depend on the bookkeeper you get in any given month. There are definitely services out there that are less expensive. There are zero approved bookkeepers and I think if you expect to pay a hundred dollars to $200 a month to do your books, that’s probably a reasonable expectation. I think in the very early days I would do it myself until it became a little annoying and then I would hire it out at that point. My next question is from John Potter and he says, “Hey Rob. I’m the non-technical co-founder of a bootstrap SaaS for accountants. I’m an accountant by trade, so I’m unfamiliar with how to set up the ideal marketing engine.” It’s good you’re listening to this podcast. I would also recommend purchasing the SaaS Playbook at saasplaybook.com and reading Traction by Gabriel Weinberg. His email continues, “I plan to focus my sales and marketing energy on my network first, but I will need to reach out to cold contacts eventually. I do plan to have a self-serve sales motion for a long time with no sales reps. Could you walk me through a few ways to set up a marketing engine for someone who has little marketing experience?” All right, John, here’s I think a big mistake that you’re making is if you’re going to sell to accountants, self-serve is 99% not going to work. Pretty much it’s not going to work. I never say never and always and these kinds of things, but I cannot imagine trying to sell to non-technical folks, especially folks who are busy and bill by the hour. We’re talking legal, accounting, consulting, non-technical consultants, coaches, you are going to want to demo to handhold and to get them on board. It doesn’t have to be enterprise sales, it doesn’t have to be five call closes, should be a one call close frankly, but I don’t think you will succeed without having some type of sales process. Accountants are just going to want to talk to someone and it doesn’t have to be complicated. It doesn’t have to be a long process. With that in mind, I literally wrote an entire chapter of the book, saasplaybook.com, it’s $10 on Kindle or on PDF and I talk about the three factor framework, which is that each marketing approach has these three factors that dictate whether you should try them or not. The first is speed. Is it slow or is it fast? Meaning does it work tomorrow or does it work in a year? SEO is slow, cold email could feasibly work quickly. It may or may not, but it could feasibly. The second is scalability. There are things like a Product Hunt launch that are not scalable. You can do them once and you get a few customers and that’s it. Versus SEO content, cold outbound, there’s things that really scale up. Often those ones are perhaps more expensive or more hard to get right, but the scalability of those is a far cry from something like answering questions on Quora or doing a Product Hunt launch. The third factor is cost. We could say that if you’re writing your own content, it’s free. We know that’s not totally true, but let’s just say in answering questions on Quora, which is something I did in the early days of Hit Tail and the early days of Drip and even a little bit in the early days of TinySeed, and I did that myself. The cost in effect was zero, but it was my time versus ramping up AdWords or paying a third party to do cold email outreach on your behalf. Those three factors are different for each marketing approach. And in my chapter on marketing, I go through the 20 B2B SaaS marketing approaches and then I talk about how to use the ICE framework to prioritize them based on the impact you think they might have, you’re going to take a guess at it, the cost to do it and ease of implementing it. And I basically walked through a framework that would make no sense to walk through here on a podcast, but is it foolproof? Is it 100% going to tell you exactly what you should do in what order? No, of course not. Being a founder is making hard decisions with incomplete information and figuring out which marketing approach to try first is a hard decision that you have no data on until you try it. And using a framework like I’ve outlined, and there are others like go look at Sean Ellis and his book, I believe it’s called Hacking Growth. He talks about ways to think about growing your company. This is just a matter of getting educated and realizing that there is no one right answer. There’s going to be a lot of gut feel in it, but you have to mix that gut feel with rules of thumb. And my rule of thumb is a three factor framework and Sean Ellis’ is different and Gabriel Weinberg’s, in Traction, is also different. These are just frameworks and mental models to help folks who haven’t marketed for learn, which marketing approach should I try first? And then you get to decide if I pick a marketing approach, like cold email for example, do I go and learn it or do I hire a productized agency, for example, Postaga, they’re a TinySeed company and they have a done-for-you outreach product as well as a SaaS app that you can use for your outreach, but do you hire someone like that who has sent tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of emails and LinkedIn outreach and do you hire them to do it? Usually it’s budget, do you have the budget to hire them? So that you can test this and feel good that if it doesn’t work, the channel probably doesn’t work because the person or the team implementing it knows what they’re doing. They have a pretty high success rate. This goes back to the bad instrument or bad player analogy I mentioned on a recent solo episode where I talked about my 13-year old who is an amazing violinist. He’d been playing for 10 years and he picked up an old clunky violin. It was his first or second violin. It sounds terrible. He played it and it sounded awful because it’s just a toy, it’s like a hundred dollars thing and the strings are barely real strings. And if you walked into the room, you wouldn’t know is it that he has a bad instrument or is it that he doesn’t know how to play? And then of course he picks up a full-size violin. Sounds amazing. And that’s when you know that it was a bad instrument. With marketing approaches, if you try and approach and you’re doing the work yourself and the marketing approach doesn’t work, you don’t know if it was a bad instrument or a bad player. And I often encourage founders that I’m advising if you have the budget, try to find someone who’s good at this to test it out, to dip your toe in the water and to put your best foot forward such that if it does work great, and if it doesn’t, which is honestly the more likely outcome, then at least you know that you took the best shot you could. But oftentimes budget stands in the way and hiring someone good to do a marketing task is hard. It’s not as easy as snapping your finger and finding someone amazing. And sometimes it can be hard to know are they good at what they do or not? There’s some complexity here, but I hope that gives you an idea, John, thanks for the question.  Speaker 4:Hi Rob. Hi Steve. We met briefly, MicroConf in 2019 in Croatia. I was working on a different set idea back then, which unfortunately didn’t work out, classic, rookie mistake, building something that I thought somebody wanted, but turns out they didn’t. But that’s fine. I learned a lot. I’ve since moved on and I’ve had a new idea. It is essentially a SaaS tool for property finders in the UK, but particularly focused on foreign buyers trying to buy property in the UK. This time around, I’m going to do it differently. I’ve run a few Facebook ads to see if there’s any interest to try and get some emails to build a launch list. And that’s been really successful. We’ve 500 plus emails from foreign customers or foreign target customers, and that list is growing daily, I think that’s probably going to get to about a thousand. My question is what’s the best way to approach launching the new products to said thousand lead list? We’re obviously going to do an MVP. Is it 50 users at a time? Or the usual question of how big should the MVP be? And then final question, because I know a lot of our users are essentially coming to us through Facebook or Facebook leads, they’re obviously using their mobile phones. Now my question is that in terms of getting them to our sales website and buying and starting their subscription, what’s your views on Apple Pay? Can it work? Should it work? Does it work for subscription businesses like the one hopefully that we’re going to get going? Love the content and hopefully see you again soon. Cheers. Bye.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question. I think there’s some good stuff to dig here. I actually recorded a YouTube video called, How to Build SaaS from Scratch in Eight Simplified Steps. It’s also on the MicroConf YouTube channel, and we will link it up in the show notes. One of those steps is the phased launch, and if you have a tiny little launch list of 30 people, 50 people, there’s no reason to phase it. What I mean by phases is breaking it up into chunks exactly as you have mentioned. But if you have a product that you’re not sure if you have product market fit yet, or even you’re concerned that you don’t have the features that you want or that it’s just not anything more than an MVP, then if you add thousands of people on an email list and you put them all into your product, they’re just going to bleed out. You’re not going to retain any of them. Everybody’s going to churn, no one’s going to convert. And the idea of phasing your launch is to let in a group of users to let them try it out. And this is not beta. This is early access. This is something you charge for. They’re not beta testing the product. You should have the bugs worked out, but you’re trying to find out do they need it? Do they love it? What else do you need to build in order to retain as many as possible? Then you rinse and repeat. Yes, if I had a list of 500 people, I probably would break it up into chunks of 50 at least to start with. With Drip, we had 3,400 people on an email list, and I think I started doing it in, I think the first launch was to 300, and then we did another 300, and I realized we could totally handle it. Then we went up to like four or 500, and I believe by the end we were doing 600 at a time for the last couple. And I just increased it as my comfort level improved, my comfort level with the product, my comfort level with our conversion rate, my comfort level with our ability to support it and to close deals frankly. Again, I have that YouTube video where I talk more about this and I have a YouTube video where I talked all about the Drip launch. I believe it’s titled, From Launch To 7K MRR, and it’s also on the MicroConf channel. And I probably spent 10 or 15 minutes talking about how we did it, and that was within six months of doing it. The data was fresh in my mind at that point. And then your second question was about using Apple Pay. I’m going to be honest, I’ve never used it and I’ve never heard, I don’t know of many SaaS apps that do it right. Most of the time that’s a mobile app. Now, can Apple Pay work for subscriptions? Of course. Now, I want to be clear here that Apple Pay is different than having an iOS app in the app store. In that case, Apple’s going to take 30%, but using my Google-fu, I have looked at Apple Pay, which again, I haven’t used, but it says that Apple Pay takes no fee. This is where you just allow someone to buy your app or charge a subscription, which Apple Pay supports according to the Apple website, and you still pay the typical charge, the 3% credit card charge, but Apple Pay is a layer on top of that. I guess a concern of mine as I think this through is can I administer that? Because we used to need to upgrade or downgrade subscriptions or refund subscriptions or do all types of craziness with it. And if I don’t have a dashboard where I can do that, and it’s all the customer themselves doing it through iTunes, I don’t know if that’s how it’s managed or not. Steven, in your shoes, that’s where I would want to see the entire flow from the start to the finish of how do they subscribe, how do I administer those, how do they cancel, upgrade, downgrade, do I have the flexibility that I want when using Apple Pay, or is it going to be easier and better for me to spend whatever three, four days upfront to really build out a top-notch custom, Stripe integration or Braintree or Paddle, whoever you want to use, such that I have full control? And that I don’t know because I just haven’t evaluated the two options side by side. But if you do and you have something to report back, feel free to send it, questions at startupsfortherestofus.com and we can educate the entire community with your findings. Those are all the questions we have time for today. Thanks so much for joining me again this week. I think I’m going to answer more listener questions next week as well to try to work through some of the backlog. I hope you join me for that episode.

[inaudible] I can fix this.”  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever seen Pitch Perfect, the show about the a capella singers?  Tracy Osborn:No, I haven’t.  Rob Walling:The women in college and they… It’s super fun. It’s like-  Tracy Osborn:That sounds cool.  Rob Walling:… tongue in cheek doesn’t take itself too seriously. Good songs like Glee-ish. I’m not the biggest fan of Glee, but at least, it has cool music every 10 minutes. Anyways, there’s one of them that projectile vomits when she gets nervous, so when you were going like this, I’m like, “Uh-oh, are you Pitch Perfecting?  Tracy Osborn:That’s my interview prep, right?  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s the interview prep. Welcome back to Startups For The Rest of Us. I’m Rob Walling, and this week, I’m joined by Tracy Osborn. You know her as tracymakes on x.com, and she spoke with Leon Barnard of Balsamiq. They talk about how to design faster and more effectively with wireframing. Tracy, welcome to the show.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. Happy to be here. Happy to be part of the podcast.  Rob Walling:Yeah. We’re trying something a little different this week. We are longtime friends with Balsamiq as people know. This podcast as well as MicroConf have long followed Peldi. Peldi spoken at MicroConf many times and has been a long longtime supporter. Balsamiq reached out and said, “We’ve written a book. Several of our team members have written a book,” and I thought this is a great opportunity to talk about wireframing and design on the podcast, but I don’t have expertise in it, and frankly, my interest level with it is not as high as other folks I know, so I sent you an email. I said, “Tracy, you want to handle this?” And you said?  Tracy Osborn:Absolutely.  Rob Walling:I tease it a little bit. You interviewed Leon. What’s the book and what’s it about?  Tracy Osborn:When people see the word wireframing, they think of something like the super designers out there who focus on all the super designy stuff, and wireframing seems like a concept that only applies to someone who has a degree or who is doing that as their full-time job. I left at the opportunity to do this interview because this wireframing is something that I’ve had in my toolbox since I have a graphic design degree, but it’s not something I see often talked about in the startup entrepreneur non-designer world. It looks kind of intimidating. It looks like it’s something that might slow down your processes, but in reality, it’s something that can help you go faster and do more and communicate better with other folks out there. So, it was really exciting to kind of leap into with Leon.  Rob Walling:Well, we shouldn’t leave out Leon’s co-authors. There’s actually three authors of the book and all three of them work at Balsamiq, and who better to write a book like this than folks who are day-to-day 40 hours a week thinking about wireframing, building software products for people who want to wireframe? There’s probably software entrepreneurs listening to this or aspiring founders who may think they don’t care about wireframing. Why would they need to know that? So, as a final pitch before we dive in, Tracy, why should someone listen to this episode?  Tracy Osborn:Wireframing helps you figure out the ideas you want for the way that your website works, whether that’s the front end or the back end, it allows you to try different concepts in a faster way, allows you to take those concepts to folks who may give you feedback or the design you’re working with so you can share what you want to work on, allows you to talk with your team members about what you want to do without having to have a full-fledged final mockup, and overall allows founders to work faster.  Rob Walling:Before we dive into the episode, I have two announcements for you. The first is that TinySeed applications for our Fall 2023 Accelerator batch will be open from September 4th to the 16th. We are funding companies in two batches. We have our Americas and our EMEA batch. That’s Europe, Middle East, and Africa. And if you have at least $500 in MRR and you are looking for the perfect amount of funding, as well as world-class mentorship you can’t get anywhere else, and a tight-knit community unlike any you’ve been part of, head to tinyseed.com/apply. If it’s from September 4th to the 16th, applications will be open and you can apply there. It usually takes about 10 minutes. If they’re not open, you can enter your email to be notified when we open the doors. I hope to see your application. My second announcement is that while some of you might have spent the summer vacationing or spending time at the lake, our team at MicroConf has been gearing up for one of the biggest announcements we’ve ever made. The last time we made a major announcement was in 2019, so I don’t want to jinx it, but there are some pretty amazing things coming down the line to help you build, launch, and grow your SaaS business. If you want to be the first to hear about it, head over to futureofmicroconf.com and sign up for our announcement event that’s going to happen on September 14th of 2023. You won’t want to miss it. Book is Wireframing for Everyone. It’s available on Amazon. With that, let’s dive into your conversation.  Tracy Osborn:Leon, thank you so much for joining us here at Startups For The Rest of Us. I left on this chance to run this interview because I have a degree in draft design and I’m personally already aware around the benefits of wireframing and why you should use wireframing, but when I joined the startup world and started working with the entrepreneurs and founders, I found that the term wireframing wasn’t often used. So, what brought you to this wireframing world and what drives your passion to it? Maybe you can kind of explain what wireframing is for the audience that is listening to the podcast.  Leon Barnard:Sure. Happy to answer these questions. I’m really excited to be here. I started my career as a UX designer, and when I started a long, long time ago, the default tools for UX designers were things like Photoshop, and designers were expected to create these pixel perfect mockups. And then, when I was in my first job, I was realizing that that work was not making its way into the product, except for maybe icons or some of these graphic assets that the tools that we were expected to use were not really actually very effective for helping to build a product. So, I found myself turning to tools like PowerPoint and Visio to capture ideas and concepts that I thought would be much more useful in having actual conversations. I don’t know if I even knew the term wireframing at that time. And then, when this tool Balsamiq came out and I heard it was for creating wireframes, I was like, “Oh, this is the tool for me. This is a tool that will help me communicate my design ideas,” which is a very different process from say, building something that looks like a final product because I was finding that really, in the organization I worked at, it was enterprise software. It was very developer focused. It was the developers that were leading things. So, I needed a way to participate in those conversations and insert myself into the conversations. And I found that having these sketchy low-fidelity artifacts, which is what wireframes are, they’re like a digital version of a napkin sketch. It was really a great way to get more engagement with the people who are actually having an effect on the product.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. I think that’s a term that most entrepreneurs or founders have heard is the napkin sketch. The stories of that brilliant entrepreneur who has this big company, it all started because that person was at a restaurant sketching on a napkin their first ideas or prototypes. So, that’s a wireframe in a sense.  Leon Barnard:Yes, exactly, but it’s funny because the product Balsamiq was originally called Balsamiq Mockups because that’s what they were called at Adobe, where the founder worked prior to this. Some people also call them prototypes because they’re a way to kind of prototype the interaction of a product, but I think wireframe is the best term because it’s a sketch. It’s an outline. It’s meant to be low-fidelity, which means mostly black and white, not as many details, and obviously it comes from the world of industrial design, pre-digital days where you were building something made of frame, made out of wire, which obviously wasn’t going to be the final thing. So, yes, I think wireframe is a good term for people to understand and use, but I understand there’s a lot of terms out there in every industry, so if people are not using the right technically correct term, then that’s okay. Part of the book is helping to explain the difference between a wireframe and other types of artifacts.  Tracy Osborn:So, a founder could look at a wireframe that they’re going to put into more founder terms, that they might be used to that napkin sketch, those lines and boxes, things that are super low-fidelity like you mentioned. So, what are some of the specific differences and the reasons why you should start with low-fidelity for wireframing? First, is the urge to start adding those details. I know that I had to struggle with this as a designer because I’ll start with my page and I say, “What do I want on this page? What do I want? How do I want things to work?” You’re like, “Okay, cool. I have my headline on the top, and then I have my images.” And then, you’re like, “Ooh, what is my headline going to say? What are things I could use in my headline?” And then like, “Oh, what is that photo going to be?” So, the initial prototype I’m working on is moving more and more high-fidelity, just more and more detail there. So, can you expand on some of the reasons why you want to keep something low-fidelity and maybe go into the ideation process there or reducing that urge to move into high-fidelity, something that has more content?  Leon Barnard:Yeah. You really captured some of the traps that are out there, and really, it’s just human nature. People aren’t wrong or bad for doing it. It’s so easy to get ahead of ourselves when we get into design. Especially when you’re building a product and you have other competitors to look at, you want to make something real. It’s kind of in our nature, and that’s what’s so attractive about the napkin sketches, that there’s only so far you can take it, but with digital tools today, you can make something that looks and feels real in an afternoon. But the big challenge is, is that the right product? Is that the product you should be building? Is that what people are going to pay you to ship? In my experience, what I’ve found is that if you really ask the right questions and do the right work upfront, then the design details can come later and they kind of fall into place, but if you get things wrong in the beginning and you’re not answering those fundamental questions about what is the goal of this product, who are my users, what is this trying to serve, what information needs to go on there and what doesn’t, then that’s really what’s going to be most useful. And a wireframe, especially if you’re using a tool that’s dedicated only for wireframing, then it kind of forces you to do that and makes it hard even to get into some of those details because the design process has separate distinct phases, and there’s a right time and a place for different levels of detail.  Tracy Osborn:Right. I think that’s a great place to dive into in terms of that, how-to, how do founders get started and how they start using wireframes for ideation because another urge I think a lot of people might have is to create one wireframe, and then take that one wireframe and go to different people in their company, to their customers and get feedback on that one wireframe. I think your book does a really good job of talking about the value of creating lots of different ideas. So, maybe from a founder’s perspective, what does that look like? How do you use wireframes to start generating those ideas and start going through different thoughts you might have or different directions you want to take?  Leon Barnard:Yeah. The first chapter of our book, Wireframing for Everyone, is really dedicated to explaining why wireframes matter, and really more than that, the value of low-fidelity and iteration and coming up with lots of different ideas. We reference examples from other industries where a very successful chef is going to try 10 different dishes for every one that they’re actually going to put out there, and the same with a lot of other industries and examples. So, your first idea is often not your best idea and you can build it. It’s great that you can build that idea right so quickly, but you really owe it to yourself and your audience to try to come up with as many ideas as you can early on, and that’s really going to help you generate better ideas, kind of merge and combine ideas. So, it’s really all about making time for creativity in the beginning and allowing yourself to be creative. It doesn’t have to take a long time because you’re not investing a lot of time to make something that looks final. You’re just letting your imagination go wild and being okay with that, and reserving judgment and all of that kind of things, that kind of brainstorming mentality. And that can be really useful because you can do it in an afternoon and you’ve got 10, 20 different ideas that you didn’t have when you started, and you’ve learned things that you didn’t know that you knew maybe, or you’ve found out questions that you didn’t know that you needed answers to. Just spending a day to do that, it’s going to get you off on such a better foot than trying and going ahead and building your first idea.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. For example, they’re working on their landing page for their product, so rather than creating one wireframe with their initial idea and just building it, I don’t know, do you have a rule of thumb for how many different iterations, something where someone can say like, “This is a good amount of ideas out there”? I think your book goes into… There’s the obvious ideas, but there’s also tactics that you have in your book and how to find the nonobvious ideas, how to step out of there. So, specifically, how would a founder go through this process if they’re say, creating a landing page?  Leon Barnard:Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up. Yeah. There’s a whole art to creativity, and sometimes, often the best way to be more creative is to impose constraints. If you just say, “Oh, let just come up with a landing page,” then you’re like, “Well…” You’re only maybe going to come up with what you already can picture in your head. But if you say, what if I can’t use any text or what if it has to be text only, or let me start with a mobile version of it, or let me do it in the… What if it has to be targeted at children? Coming up with kind of these sometimes artificial constraints or sometimes they can be realistic constraints. What if I’m targeting people in countries that don’t have good access to the internet and the whole page needs to load and be half a megabyte or something like that? So, there are some techniques that you can use or you can just tap into that subconscious and say, “Okay, I’m going to make myself to eight different ideas in five minutes.” So, you don’t really engage the judgmental part of your brain, and you just let that more primitive subconscious part kind of kick into high gear. And then, there’s also this idea of just really pushing yourself to create one more. When you’re tired and you don’t think you can have any more ideas, maybe just saying, “Okay, let me just do one more that just might be crazy and might not make any sense.” But then maybe there’s one little piece of it that you end up using in the final product. So, there’s a couple strategies, but most of them involve either pushing yourself or imposing some kind of constraints in order to stimulate your creativity.  Tracy Osborn:Right. So, rather than looking at a page saying, “I’m creating a landing page,” you’re asking yourself different questions as you’re going through this. Whether using a tool like Balsamiq or pen and paper, creating really quick sketches of boxes and lines and different ways of laying this information out in different ways of approaching this process, wireframing really allows someone to go through each of these ideas very quickly because you can imagine that mocking up every single one of these questions, how would this be for mobile, how would it be for mobile for people of low bandwidth, trying to do a full mockup on those would be quite difficult and very time-consuming. So, wireframing is really there, so you can iterate so quickly and just go through all these ideas and try to see if you can get to that nugget, that really special idea that you weren’t thinking of in the beginning.  Leon Barnard:Yeah, exactly. The cost of having bad ideas or ideas that don’t go anywhere is so low that there’s not really any penalty to creating an idea that you’re not sure about because it doesn’t cost you very much time.  Tracy Osborn:We’ve covered why wireframes should be low-fidelity and quick and easy and whatnot for ideation and the process of creating wireframes. Can we go a little bit more into the value of wireframes for communication? Again, for a founder who’s listening to this podcast, there’s probably a lot of situations where they have the ideas in their head or maybe some really basic wireframes of kind of the direction they want to go, and now they’re hiring a contract designer, maybe someone who has a lot of context about their company or they’re working with the developer to implement that vision. How can wireframing be used as a tool to aid in communication?  Leon Barnard:Yeah. Here’s where it’s a little bit tricky because the temptation is to build something that looks final and the assumption that if you make say, a mockup or a pixel perfect version of something that you can hand off to somebody, that they will understand it, and if you say, “Oh, if I create a wireframe, then there’s going to be a lot of things that they understand,” but what we don’t realize is what’s not communicated in even some of the high-fidelity things. So, it’s often better just to have something low-fidelity, and then have a conversation around it because you can hand off something that looks final and get something back that’s totally different because you didn’t specify how it should be on mobile or how it should resize, for example. So, they’re a really good tool to aid in communication, but not to be seen as a replacement for communication. So, kind of like “a picture is worth a thousand words,” but also you can talk about that picture. And then, also with wireframes, one of the key concepts to understand is that you can annotate them. Because they’re not going to be mistaken for the final design, you can put pictures. You can put words on them. You can put little sticky notes and arrows, and you can use say, bright red or pink or something to say, “Oh, when you click this, it should do this.” So, feel free to mix in words and instructions and sticky notes and all kinds of things to help them be easier to understand, but the best way to communicate is to sit down with somebody in front of that wireframe and talk them through it, so they can ask questions. They can even give you ideas and maybe in your session, you can make changes there on the fly that ultimately communication is best between people. And just because you can create something that looks final, don’t mistake that as a reason not to have a conversation with somebody because there’s so many nuances and so many details, and talking to somebody about something is such a rich forum for that.  Tracy Osborn:Right. In one situation, you might have this full design up for a landing page, and of course a designer’s going to take a look at it and just implement it. Maybe not the designer, but maybe the contractor or developer you hired. However, if you have a wireframe that has annotations with additional context of the things you want to do and the way that things are working, and then the wireframe itself being low-fidelity feels easier to have a conversation about because it’s not final. So, the other person on the other side of the screen can look at it and using their own imagination kind of go into different directions and have a better conversation or have an easier time having a conversation with you because they know that things are not in the final state. I think that’s a really interesting point that you make in this book as another one of the powers of the low-fidelity or maybe even medium-fidelity at this point. Maybe you’ve started to add in some of those headlines in order to have those conversations with other people.  Leon Barnard:Yeah. I mean, that word conversation is so important. Wireframes help you have a conversation and they help you get feedback, so if you show somebody something that isn’t final, you’re going to have a conversation. That’s where the value, that’s what you want. You want to have that conversation. So, that’s what’s really valuable I’d say about wireframes.  Rob Walling:Life as a founder can put a strain on even the strongest relationships, but spending dedicated quality time with your better half can help you recharge and refocus, and who better to help you make the most of those moments than our friends at Created with Love?

Usually, they’ll have a landing page already designed. Maybe they have their onboarding flow that’s already set, and they’re looking at that saying, “Okay, I want to change this. I know that there’s problems here and I want to change it.” And I think the urge there would be to just start moving things around within that live page or start working with their existing components that are right there. How can these folks use the process of wireframing instead of going from, say, high-fidelity to high-fidelity? Where does wireframing come into play here when you already have something that’s launched and out of the world and you’re not starting from scratch?  Leon Barnard:That’s a great question. I think it goes back to that idea of things being low-cost, so you can experiment with things much more easily. One of the things that we encourage in the book is, when you’re starting a wireframe, to start really low-fidelity, so start with some words. So, I would say if you’re doing a redesign for a landing page, just start by writing down some of the changes that you want to make, some of the things that you think are working and are not working, and start writing those down even on a wireframe and maybe just playing around with some of the words saying, “Oh, I want to have a call to action here. I want to do a better job of highlighting some of the features here.” And maybe even just laying out in sticky note or having box placeholders for where you think things should go to really take you out of being stuck on that current design. You’re going to get a lot more creative ideas if you just say, “Well, let me just focus on the content for a second and not get hung up on how it looks currently, and come up with five different variations of just having things in different places without really thinking about the appearance so much.” I think that’s just going to open you up to so many new and different ideas that are really centered around, “Okay, what is the content? What are people’s goals?” Rather than thinking about what visual elements might track people’s eye or even how should the navigation be, but just really not having to think about, “Oh, I’m building a user interface,” but think about, “I’m focused on the content, the information that’s going to be on here, and I can almost step outside of what I think of as the design, but the content, the information on there is the first step in design as well.” So, it allows you to work at different layers of abstraction or different layers of design, kind of the layer zero or something, which is just the non-visual level.  Tracy Osborn:I think that’s a really great point to jump into in terms of this design process because your book is Wireframing for Everyone, so the instinct when we’re reading that is specifically about wireframe, but I think this book, it’s a really succinct, easy to read 150-ish pages book is not just wireframing, or at least it explains why wireframing isn’t just the actual process of creating boxes and lines and doing this layout. A lot of it is around that customer research process and why that’s important and why that goes into it. The other parts of the book… We talked about communication already. There’s parts of the book that go onto visual hierarchy, which I think is really important. So, it’s all these design principles, these pieces that really help someone who’s a non-designer understand what the design process is and how it’s not just say, creating a layout, but it’s really understanding the goals behind the website and what you’re trying to build, and then having this tool so you can iterate on that. What went into the decision between you and your co-authors, Michael Angeles and Billy Carlson? What went into the decision to create a book where the focus wasn’t just on wireframing, or were there iterations that this book went into? Did you start just on wireframing and then realizing that the topic had to be broader? I’m kind of curious about the background there.  Leon Barnard:Yeah. Thanks for recognizing that and bringing that up. Yeah. I would say this book is not just about wireframing, and the reason we added for everyone to the title is to show that wireframing is a technique that everybody can use because it’s something that can apply to all parts of the process to many roles, and there’s this idea of there’s a wireframe as an artifact, but wireframing as an act is really a way of thinking about things that you want to invest time, into exploration and discovery, and answering fundamental questions early on. So, the other nice thing about the book is it all comes from real-world experience. I was a mentor for a bootcamp. I’ve seen a lot of educational resources for UX designers, and they talk about wireframing, wireframes, how to create them, but they don’t tell you how things work in the real world. So, the three of us authors, we all worked for different types of software companies in our lives and we saw what wireframes can do, the value that they can provide, and it’s really as a way of getting people engaged in having those design conversations, having more people have a seat at the table in the design process. So, as far as the three of us writing it, we all had slightly different backgrounds. None of us were authors, so we were really nervous about how are we actually going to write a book. So, A, it was nice that we had three people working on it, and B, it was really great that we worked with A Book Apart as editors to help us craft it into something that all worked together and helped us cut out a lot of fluff. Billy has a background in graphic design, so he really understands how that element of it can improve your wireframe I worked a lot with developers and PMs to try to understand the software development process and where design and different types of design can fit in. Michael Angeles is a great UI designer, big advocate for wireframes, and he’s really good at finding ways to give feedback and communicate with people to kind of come together on things. So, we all had different areas of expertise, but we all knew that the wireframe is just an artifact. It’s just a tool. It doesn’t add any value on its own because it’s not something that ships to the customer. So, it’s really what they can be used for that’s the most important thing. I mean, anybody can learn how to wireframe in half an hour, but that’s not going to help you necessarily be more successful at getting your design ideas into the final product because really, kind of a unifying theme in the book is that what matters is what ships and wireframes are a way to bring people on the team together to ship something that everybody’s happy with and works for the customer, as well as for the business and everything like that. So, it’s really just a piece of the puzzle.  Tracy Osborn:Other than your book, what two to three resources would you recommend for folks who are non-designers wanting to, say, jump into this area and feel a bit more confident in starting out with doing design and starting to create things from scratch?  Leon Barnard:Sure. I’m going to bring up the resources chapter or section right here, but one of the things that was fun was to dig into some of those resources and reread them. I think one of the biggest inspirations was a book called Sketching User Experiences by Bill Buxton. It’s very philosophical. It’s a fun read. It’s very abstract, but it really talks about the sketching process, and there’s so much emphasis on creativity, and just coming out of that, it’s hard to think of why you wouldn’t spend time upfront doing this and just what value it provides. We wanted kind of a condensed version of that, that was also more applicable to real software processes. So Sketching User Experiences is a great book. We love books like Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug, which is a great way of seeing how a UX designer sees the world, that it’s not about the layout. It’s not about the aesthetics. It’s about finding a way that your user can use your application in an intuitive way and trying to put yourself in their shoes. So, our book is kind of a summary of a lot of other books or topics from other books. But then also another book that we really like is UX for Lean Startups by Laura Klein, and she talks about wireframes in it. So, we kind of felt like our book would be inserted into the point where she talks about wireframes and it’s like, “Okay, now here’s a deeper dive into them but about how to work in a lean kind of agile way where you’re not spending a lot of time doing work that isn’t adding value to the product.” So, I love the ideas of lean UX and lean and kind of lean startup mentality, so I think it fits really nicely into those books as well.  Tracy Osborn:I’m also a huge fan of all the lean startup world, lean UX world because that’s something I think a lot of founders… It’s really useful for founders as we’re building our companies, as we are trying to avoid the tendencies to really expand how much work we have to do and figure out the ways that we can kind of tighten up our work. So, this is a great example of something that might look like we’re adding more work to our plate, as if we’re trying to cover all the aspects of building a startup, by adding the wireframing part. As you are working on your ideas for your landing page, it might feel like, “Oh, I could just cut this out and save myself more time.” And I think that we’ve really covered in this why that process, while it might take more time, saves you more time in the long run when you’re trying to be efficient with building your startup because you can land on a better idea faster due to these wireframes. Is that correct?  Leon Barnard:Yes. I mean, I think it absolutely fits in. I mean, lean is all about doing experiments and seeing what works and what doesn’t work, and in the same way, that can feel like a waste of time. Why am I going to do the work to come up with two different ideas for a landing page when I could just spend less time and build one? But it’s all about experiment and test and iterate, and that’s exactly what wireframes allow you to do is come up with 10 different ideas in the same amount of time that it would take you to come up with one more polished idea, and then test those, get feedback, put them in front of customers maybe. So, find out if you’re on the right track before you start coding because that’s when things get expensive. It’s once you start investing in code, once you ship a full-fledged product that’s out in the world, it’s harder to make changes to it, but it’s easy to make changes when you’re in the early phases when it’s mostly internal. So, it really, I think, is going to save you time in the long run.  Tracy Osborn:I love that point. I think that’s a really great way to start wrapping things up. So, to go through some of our points that we’ve put out here, wireframing is the process of creating these low-fidelity mockups of the things that you’re trying to design, and you can use those low-fidelity mockups to help in your ideation process and run for many different ideas and you can use those mockups in the communication process to work better with the designers and contractors and team members as you are building your product. Is there any other things that you want to leave us with as we wrap up?  Leon Barnard:Yeah. One of the messages that we want to get across, especially for startup founders, people who don’t have a designer, is that design work is not maybe what you think it is. Common mistake we see non-designers make is trying to act as a designer or do what they think a designer does, which is making something that looks cool, but a good designer is someone who asks a lot of questions. What is the use case? Who’s going to be using it? How often are they going to be using it? So, think about wireframes as a tool to help you answer those questions, help come up with ideas around those key important questions, and resist that temptation to try to make something that looks finished. So, use wireframes as just one tool, just the way that you would use the other tools in your toolbox. Don’t think about, “Okay, now I’m doing the design,” but just think of them as a tool at your disposal to help solve certain problems that you have. It’s just one of the tools among many, so don’t get stuck on these categories about, “Oh, now I’m a designer,” or, “Now, I’m designing.” Really, it’s all part of the same thing, which is helping you come up with the right solution for the problem that you’re trying to solve.  Tracy Osborn:That’s fantastic. I love it. Let’s end on that. Thank you so much, Leon. It’s been a joy to talk with you. If folks want to follow up with you, you can be found on LinkedIn under your name or at Twitter on Leon… Is it Barnard?

You say build a landing page. How do I get people to it? And I don’t mean to poke fun at those questions, but that’s like saying, “I’m a startup founder. What should I know about being a startup founder?” Everything. I love the smell of startups in the morning. I’m your host, Rob Walling, and this is Startups for the Rest of Us. In this episode, I go through listener questions covering topics like current B2B SaaS valuations and why some people are holding out for those 2021 inflated valuations, how to pick one idea to start building, choosing between two ideas with pros and cons, whether to start a podcast to build an audience and more. Before we dive into the episode, I have two announcements for you. The first is that TinySeed applications for our fall 2023 accelerator batch will be open from September 4th to the 16th. We are funding companies in two batches. We have our Americas and our EMEA batch, that’s Europe, Middle East, and Africa. And if you have at least $500 in MRR and you are looking for the perfect amount of funding as well as world-class mentorship, you can’t get anywhere else, and a tight-knit community, unlike any you’ve been part of, head to tinyseed.com/apply. If it’s from September 4th to the 16th, applications will be open and you can apply there, usually takes about 10 minutes. If they’re not open, you can enter your email to be notified when we open the doors. I hope to see your application. And my second announcement is that while some of you might have spent the summer vacationing or spending time at the lake, our team at MicroConf has been gearing up for one of the biggest announcements we’ve ever made. The last time we made a major announcement was in 2019, so I don’t want to jinx it, but there are some pretty amazing things coming down the line to help you build, launch, and grow your SaaS business. If you want to be the first to hear about it, head over to futureofmicroconf.com and sign up for our announcement event, that’s going to happen on September 14th, 2023. You won’t want to miss it. And with that, let’s dive into our first question about B2B SaaS valuations.  Patrick:Hi Rob. I’m a non-technical bootstrap founder and acquisition entrepreneur. For the past two years, I have been looking to acquire a self-serve B2B SaaS. For the past year, I’ve been specifically looking for a company doing MRR in the neighborhood of 10K. There are two reasons I’ve specifically been targeting companies in this range. One, my hope with acquiring a 10K MRR company is that it’s cashflowing roughly $75,000 a year after cogs and I can use that to go into scale up mode, putting true automations, analytics, marketing in place. Second reason I’ve been targeting companies in this range is that debt is so ridiculously expensive right now and if I buy this company for cash, I can stop losing to all cash offers. Here’s the problem. During a pandemic, SaaS valuations went haywire. The latest Centurica data shows that multiples are finally coming back to Earth for large deals, but no one told the founders out there with companies in my range. I haven’t seen SaaS deals for less than 5X multiple of ARR in forever. Some founders are even engaging brokers and still looking at 10X or more. I’m getting burned out, man. Can you help me make sense of why founders think that their companies worth so much more than it really is? Yes, I might be able to pull some levers and grow this company, but you don’t get to price it based on what someone else might be able to do for it. Please help me understand and thanks for everything you do for the SaaS community. Oh, and can you also give an update on when the audiobook will be available on Google Play or Apple Books? Thanks.  Rob Walling:Yeah, this is tough Patrick, and this is not only happening with bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped kind of lower end revenue SaaS companies, but this is happening with collectibles. This is happening with real estate in some places. This is happening with any type of asset where you set the price. It’s obviously not happening with stocks because that’s a liquid and an efficient market, but these inefficient markets where people can basically set their own sale price and say no to offers that are even 10% below it, they’re experiencing this across the board because we all got dollar signs in our eyes in 2021. And you can see it with venture-backed startups that raised at huge valuations when they really weren’t worth that much, but the market was so frothy that let’s say they raised at $100 million valuation when they had $2 million of ARR or $3 million. That was not unheard of. It was not every deal, but there were deals where the multiples were that high. There were even deals with multiples higher than that. These days, you just can’t do that. The market doesn’t support it. Maybe if you’re an AI startup and you’re growing really fast, but you get the idea, most companies are not going to get that. And so folks at some point have to come down to Earth and so the way I’d be thinking about it in your shoes is, I know you’ve been patient but you just have to be patient for this kind of thing. And if you get it on the way up, the interesting thing is as you see valuations increasing, it makes a lot of sense to buy because you know or expect that next month, next year, that company is going to be worth a bit more. The multiples are creeping their way up and you’re getting a good value.When they’re falling, makes it really hard to pay top dollar because you don’t know if next month it’ll be down 10% or next year it’ll be down a full 1X multiple below what you paid. I don’t know of an easy way around this except to generate your own deals. So I have acquired, it depends on how you count, but certainly north of a dozen and probably closer to 30 different apps, websites, info products, SaaS apps, downloadable software, even an e-commerce site, a couple of e-commerce sites over the course of many years, and I got them from three different places. One were forums just where I was involved. It was just communities where people would put something up for sale or they’d mentioned they need marketing help, needed a partner and I bought the app from them and decided to market it myself. The other option, which is pretty popular these days, and I would think about, is certainly through brokers and I’m sure you’re with all the main brokers. I would mention the Quiet Lights, the Empire Flippers, the FE Internationals. But the third was I did cold outreach and I sent probably close to 50 emails, not in the annoying way people do cold outreach today. But back in 2010 I sent 50, maybe even 75 emails to products that looked dated. They just weren’t being maintained anymore. They looked crufty, they looked long in the tooth, and I basically generated my own deal flow and that’s where I was then the single buyer and I was able to negotiate a price that made sense for me because there were no other buyers competing with me basically. So that would be the other thing I would consider if I were in your shoes. There could obviously be an entire podcast around how to source those deals, but if you give it some thought, put your mind to it, I’m sure you can think of some interesting criteria to use. But I do like the fact that you’re buying something for 10K a month. That’s like a nice revenue mark because that allows you to almost support yourself. I know you said 75K in profit after that, which depending on where you live may or may not support you, but I do like that price range. Now with that said, that price range is extremely competitive because a lot of people are trying to buy in that range. It’s the same thing, if you look at single family houses and houses from let’s say one to four units, the prices of those are a lot higher per unit or a lot higher per rental dollar than if you buy a big apartment building because there’s so many people trying to get into that space. There’s so many people doing it on the side or trying to make money in real estate. The same thing actually is true with high-end collectibles, whether it’s comic books, baseball cards, coins, it doesn’t matter. You’ll see on a really valued piece, something that everyone wants, let’s say the first appearance of Spider-Man and Amazing Fantasy 15. As you go in higher and higher grades where these things are literally six figures and ultimately seven figures. I think it’s a 9.6 that sold for several million dollars. But as you go down, the multiples compressed, so by the time you get down to a really ratty copy, a 1.0, 1.5, 1.8, there’s so many people that just want to own that book and the price for a 1.0 or a 1.5 can be really close to a 2.0 and a 2.5 because again, there’s just a lot of competition for it. That’s where buying in this price range of that 10K a month, it can be tough. There is just more competition there. Sounds like you’re putting in the work, sounds like you’re being patient and I have a feeling you will be successful eventually. Patrick’s second question was about whether the SaaS playbook audiobook would be available on Google Play or Apple Books and the good news is it is available, so I submit it through Audible’s ACX, which is like the author exchange and it’s available now on Audible. It’s available on Amazon as paperback, Kindle and an audiobook and it’s available, it says on iTunes. I believe that is Apple Books. I honestly don’t know. It’s not available on Google Play. You are literally the first person to ever have mentioned that. So if I get resounding requests for it, I will certainly have my project manager look into how difficult that is to do it and to manage. As of now, it’s not in Google Play but it is in electronic format, not audio, but like EPUB format on Apple Books. So again, you can get it on Amazon in all three formats. You can get it on Audible and you can get it on Apple Books, and EPUB as well as through iTunes/Apple Books as an audiobook. That’s the question mark. I would just think ACX would say Apple Books if that’s what it was on, but it says iTunes and I’m kind of at the mercy of their documentation to understand that. So thanks for the question, Patrick, and of course you can go to saasplaybook.com if you want to buy it directly from me. I’m trying to have cheaper prices than the Amazon audibles because it’s crazy the percentage that Audible specifically takes. Amazon actually doesn’t take an egregious percentage, but it is nice to go direct. Then we have a direct relationship and hopefully I can save you a few bucks, but wherever it works for you, love it if you would pick up the SaaS Playbook. Thanks for that question, Patrick. Our next question is from Anders. He’s trying to choose between two software ideas.  Anders Gustafsson.:Hi, Rob. My name’s Anders Gustafsson. I’m a non-technical individual with two separate ideas for a B2B SaaS. Both are drawn from problems that I experience daily as the owner of an automotive repair business, finding qualified technicians for my team and diagnosing and repairing vehicles correctly and efficiently. In both instances, I believe there’s an opportunity to leverage generative AI for new solutions. Based on my research talking to potential customers, the recruiting solution is more novel with limited competition, but the feedback is that a smaller portion of the market would consider purchasing. The repair solution is the opposite. A large portion of the market would purchase, but I would be going toe to toe with lots of well-funded competitors who are likely to pursue similar solutions. I would like your thoughts on how you might analyze these opportunities so I can throw my energy and time behind one. Thanks a lot, love your show.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Anders. Questions like this are often hard to answer with limited information. It’s that balance of like, I really do appreciate the brevity of your voicemail because it means I don’t have to wade through three or four minutes of audio and a bunch of different factors, but it depends on a lot of things. And so I struggle to give a recommendation of, “Hey, you should do this.” The way I think about it is based on what you’ve said in your shoes, if I were trying to make this decision, I personally do not like creating new categories. As much as I’m a builder, I like making new things. I’m going to build this new tool that no one else has and there’s no competition is and it’s so cool. Aren’t I creative? And wasn’t that fun to build. Usually that’s a fool’s errand. It’s very, very hard to build that without a cajillion dollars in funding in many, many years in invested into creating that category. HubSpot did this with inbound marketing as an example, and I talked to Dharmesh at Business of Software and he said, “Yeah, I estimate it took us $5 million and I forget how … It was many years to drive home this category, to make this into its own category.” And then they branched into CRM and obviously the rest is history there. But if I’m going to go after a space these days, I personally want to go into a more competitive space, even with well-funded competitors where I can carve out a position. I want to carve out a corner of the market to where if I have this repair solution that we build, while it may compete with these more well-funded customers, it’s obvious who should use mine versus theirs and it’s obvious why you should use mine versus theirs and maybe that’s a focus, maybe that’s a feature set. Maybe that’s just the positioning of if you’re in the Pacific Northwest and the laws are different there, or the parts are different there, or maybe it’s only for shops less than 10 people and all the other software is really bad for them or vice versa. There’s some angle there that I would be looking for and trying to make it a durable advantage as well because it’s easy to get in to the idea of, “I’m going to build some features and that’s going to be my moat.” But the problem is features get replicated. Every feature I’ve ever built into software has been copied by someone. Even the awesome super cool ones that we knew were novel and we knew we went back to first principles and we built this incredible engine that did all this cool automation and just one by one, all that stuff over the course of the next few years was replicated. And so it was a temporary moat, but it was not one that lasted several years. Brand is a pretty strong moat, virality is a pretty strong moat, assuming you can get it going. And there are other SaaS moats, I actually talk about these in the SaaS Playbook, speak of the devil. But all that said, if you really have a passion to do the hiring solution, a smaller market, no competition, that actually scares me. But also is that a good step one business? If you haven’t been a software entrepreneur, shouldn’t you start small and go into a vertical? Yeah, not a bad idea. Usually though, if I’m going to start small, I want something where the traffic is built in, it’s the Shopify app store. I know SEO, and I know I can target these specific terms where I kind of eliminate a lot of the headache of SaaS by just having marketing built in or distribution just built in to the model. My concern with the hiring solution, is it a two-sided marketplace? If so, don’t build it, just don’t. So I’m actually putting a pause and maybe it’s a permanent ban on two types of questions. I’m no longer going to answer questions about two-sided marketplaces. My answer is going to be don’t, because I listened back to several of the episodes where I’ve answered listener questions and just too many people think that that’s a shortcut to not having to build this big feature set. Or I don’t know, I guess because what you see on TV, and that’s what you see when you read about Uber or whatever, but it’s a siren song and bootstrappers don’t make that work. The only time they make it work is when they have one side of the marketplace already. They have an audience like the Tropical MBA guys did when they started Dynamite Jobs. The other type of question I’m no longer going to answer is the one where it’s, okay, so I built an app, how do I market it? Or I have a landing page, you say build a landing page. How do I get people to it? And I don’t mean to poke fun at those questions, but that’s like saying I’m a startup founder. What should I know about being a startup founder? Everything. You should go back to all 675 episodes of this podcast and read all the books, educate yourself, do some work on your own, watch the YouTube videos. I know we put out a lot of content, but it’s pretty curated. You can zip through these YouTube videos at 2X and get an education. You can listen to episodes of this podcast while you drive, while you do the dishes, while you do yard work. Put them at 1.5X, put them in the background and absorb that information over time and then you’ll have more, I would say, specific questions that I think are more constructive for yourself and I think are more constructive for the listeners. So that’s a tangent. I didn’t mean to derail your question Anders, but I do appreciate the specificity of this one, and if I were in your shoes, I’d be looking to do the one with competitors. That part doesn’t turn me off. In fact, it’s intriguing to me. It shows that there is likely money in that space and as long as you go into it, not saying I’m just going to replicate it, I’m just going to build what they have and it’s going to be half price. Half price can be one advantage, but you need others as well. You don’t just want to be the cheapest one in the market. So thank you for that question. I hope it was helpful. M y next question is a text question. It is from almost a year ago, and so some of these text questions stick around for a while and eventually I just want to bring them in and answer them. This one is from Bavesh who has sent in several questions and I appreciate him sending them in. They’re always quite specific. His question in this one is, “I have a complicated question about the stair-step approach.” And then he sent me a video and I’m just going to summarize it. The video in summary says, if I have a step one product and it’s making some money and then I build or buy additional ones, I get to step two where I own all my time and then I’m going to move on to step three, which is a standalone SaaS product, do all of them have to be related? Should step three build on the same customer base or in the same market as steps one and two? Do they have to? Should they? My answer is they don’t have to, and in most stair-stepping that I see, they don’t, but if possible they should. That would be amazing. It’s just I haven’t really seen it work out very much. I’ve seen it work out in a couple cases. One example is Craig Hewitt, who right now runs Castos. He started off with a podcast editing productized service, used to be called Podcast Motor. Now it’s called Castos Productions, but he built that up to tens of thousands in MRR as he had a day job. Then since he was in the podcasting space, this is all about doing things in public, creating opportunity. Someone approached him, they said, “I have a WordPress plugin called Seriously Simple Podcasting. I will sell it to you for almost nothing.” And I think he’s been public about that purchase price. I will just say it’s less than $10,000. It was not a very expensive purchase. It was a great, great buy on his part. Then he built Castos a SaaS on top of that WordPress plugin. So he used productized service and a WordPress plugin to step into SaaS, and now he’s talked about Castos as a seven figure SaaS company. That’s where it works. That’s when it’s amazing. Everything’s going in one direction. I wish I had been able to do that. My step one, two and three ideas were all separate, all different customer bases, and it made it hard. It was not the ideal way, but it’s what happens with most people, especially if you’re acquiring because you just can’t dictate what’s available for sale at any time, and there could be a good opportunity that doesn’t kind of fit within your ecosystem that you buy and lever up. If you’re starting new ones, if you’re building all of them from scratch, which is perfectly acceptable, I would absolutely try to err on the side of having them all be related or building on top of one another or sharing the same customer base. It’s just going to make things easier in all the ways because you’re going to understand that customer base. You’re going to have shared customers, you’re going to be able to market to them just in every way imaginable. It’s going to make it much easier. So thanks for that question Bavesh. Hope that was helpful. As SaaS founders, we often look to our peers for inspiration, but what if your next big idea comes from where you least expect it? Imagine leveraging sales tactics from a $24 million jet chartering business or implementing SOPs from a franchiser. Suddenly you’ve got an edge that sets you apart. That’s essentially what my friends at the UpFlip Podcast do. They uncover lessons that are universal, unique and often unexpected by interviewing a broad spectrum of businesses. Take episode 27, for instance, where Ed Warren shares his journey of transforming a mobile card detailing business into SaaS from scratch. If you think about it, that’s a pretty unique approach. So if you’re ready to look beyond the conventional SaaS wisdom and stir up some innovation, check out the UpFlip Podcast. Just give it a search in Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your pods. You never know where your next big idea will come from and it just might be a click away.  Our next question is from Mike, and he’s wondering about co-founder equity splits and founder agreements. Mike:Hey, Rob, my name’s Mike. I am a new startup founder for a potential legal software company for attorneys, but I don’t have any tech support, so I’ve been listening to as many of these 600 or so podcasts that I can. And what I’m running into is I’ve got tech people that want to be on board, not sure of the role of co-founder, CTO, fractional employee contractor, and so I’m wondering if you have a resource out there that’s good for this kind of thing for founders agreements and or setting the roles and responsibilities and pay and or equity for some guides for that. So hopefully that question makes sense. I’m glad I’m getting to that point to have to think about those things, but I kind of hadn’t thought about it until I got this far through with the business plan and the pitch deck and getting people interested and wanting to get an MVP. I want to get that stuff hammered out, and I also want to make sure that they’re not competing with me, they’re not disclosing things and everybody gets paid fairly. So with that, I will stop talking and look forward to your answer. Thanks, man. Bye.  Rob Walling:So I have a couple thoughts here. Obviously getting a lawyer involved is the right answer, but that can be expensive. It is expensive, especially at the early stage. So in the US, if I was just looking for documents, I’m not a lawyer, I can tell you what I used when I was cash strapped and I wanted agreements. There’s a bunch of places you can go and nolo.com is one, but I used rocketlawyer.com for many years for a lot of the early Drip stuff. Is it perfect? No. Is it inexpensive and convenient? Yes. So I used it and then as we got further along with revenue and things got more, I’ll say complicated, but also we had more money, I actually rewrote quite a few of these or had a lawyer rewrite them or update them so that I was more comfortable with them. Another option is a TinySeed company, Lexgo and they operate in South America and they are much like a Rocket Lawyer equivalent for South America, Lexgo.cl. And then in terms of dividing up equity or trying to figure out who gets what, I honestly have not seen much written on that. I, of course, I’ve given thoughts on that in the past, but it’s always a very specific question that I’m weighing in on where it’s kind of like, well, the business is at 20K MRR and you’ve done the whole thing and you’re bringing on kind of a “co-founder” which is really just a late added business partner. They should get X% based on things I’ve seen. It’s just rules of thumb and there’s no direct formula for it. But I will say that slicingpie.com started as an ebook, and it looks like they’ve now built it into a SaaS where I’m sure you could track the tasks they talk about. Basically you take a bunch of tasks or things to get done and you put a certain amount of equity attached to each one, or maybe you can do it hourly too. Haven’t read the eBooks probably since it first came out, which is eight or nine years ago, but it’s basically a method for doing what you’re thinking about. And there ar H1 at slicingpie.com is you’ve found the world’s only fair startup equity calculator. Slicing Pie is a universal one size fits all model that creates a perfectly fair equity split in early stage bootstraps startup companies. I will admit, I read it and I thought to myself, I probably wouldn’t use this. It just didn’t fit my way of thinking, but I have known a handful of startups that have used it and I really haven’t heard any complaints. So that’s about as much of an endorsement as I can give it, having never tried it myself. It’s always a struggle when you’re talking about equity and it probably should be because it’s one of those things that if you just hand wave early on and you say, “Oh, we’ll worry about it later,” it can get really ugly, especially if the business takes off as becomes a million, $2 million ARR business, that’s worth a lot of money. And then at that point, 1 percentage points, 2 percentage points becomes a substantial amount of money. So I am glad that you’re thinking about it and digging into it, and I hope my suggestions were helpful. And our last two questions of the day come from the same listener.  Speaker 5:Hi, Rob. When you were working on Drip, I noticed on your video representation on MicroConf, you had a few validations before going ahead with building Drip. How many people said “Yes, that’s what we need, and what was the tipping point for you to say, okay, enough, this is it, I’m building this?” Thank you for taking your time to answer this question.  Rob Walling:This feels like a pretty quick and easy answer for me. There’s a couple of different ways to validate things that I’ve become familiar with. One is to put up the landing page or put up the website and talk about the value proposition, see how many people are interested. That’s usually when it’s a marketing led startup, meaning you’re going to drive a lot of people into a funnel, get them to convert. The other way is to have a lot of conversations to potentially get buy-in or a yes, I would pay for that. And usually it’s like, “Hey, if I built this thing and it was $49 a month, would you pay for that? Would you at least try it out?” And then another level higher, which I haven’t done, is to actually take checks or to take prepayments and say, “I’ll refund you if we never get to it.” There are a bunch of different ways to do it, but the listener who asked this was asking how many people did I get to say yes? I talked to 17 people, I got 11 yeses. For me, the tipping point was at 10. I had modeled my approach after Steve Blank’s original customer development, but realistically more so after Jason Cohen’s validation or pre-validation of WP Engine. And he talked to a lot of people and he got 40 yeses. So I figured, hey, if he needs 40 and I’m building something much smaller than WP Engine, WP Engine was still pretty small at the time, to be honest. It was only a couple of years in, but I figured if I get to 10, this can definitely be a nice lifestyle business. Those are the only two case studies I’ve heard in detail of people telling this story and talking about getting to yeses and talking about how many they’ve had. And so I don’t know what the range is. I know that 5 people doesn’t feel like enough to me unless maybe you’re charging $100,000 a year and then maybe 5 companies is enough. I know that 40 feels like quite a few, and I know that a hundred would be a lot of conversations. So there’s some number in that range where I feel comfortable. And given that originally I was going to charge $99 a month, I felt like getting 10 people who would be willing to pay $99 a month was $1,000 of MRR. And I felt like if that many people needed it and paid that, that the rest of my audience would feasibly buy it in enough volume that it would be a 10 or $20,000 a month business. So do these numbers and ideas change over time? Absolutely. Do they change based on your price point, your audience, your network, the space you’re in, the industry, how many competitors there are? It absolutely does. There’s so many variables, but these are just anecdotes to help us gauge where we might want to be. Because without having heard Jason Cohen’s story and having heard my story with Drip, you kind of have no idea where to go next. And at least these guardrails can help you think, well, if I’m going to validate an idea that way, maybe I’ll follow in the footsteps of Rob and Jason. And our last question for the day is about whether to start a podcast.  Speaker 5:Hey, Rob and team, I have a question regarding building an audience. With AI, making it harder to publish and build an audience, do you think it would be worth working on a podcast or YouTube channel to build your audience in anticipation of releasing the product? Thank you. And I’m also looking forward to reading your new book.  Rob Walling:So I will admit, I don’t think AI necessarily makes it harder to publish and build an audience. I mean, I guess it means more people will crank out more crappy content, but I’ve never built an audience competing against crappy content. I’ve typically competed against pretty competent folks who are putting their all into writing ebooks or writing blogs or putting out podcasts or putting out video content. So while AI is that accelerant that can maybe help people get further, I don’t necessarily agree with the premise of the statement that AI is going to make it harder to build an audience because I think a lot of AI generated content will be mayonnaise, bland. Unless you really know how to write a good prompt, trying to captivate an audience with bland content, it doesn’t work. So then the second part of your question, I also, I guess I don’t agree with the premise of this, that you should build an audience at all in anticipation of releasing your product. I mean, if you’re building a B2C product, then of course build an audience of consumers, virality. This is where the B2C tools come into play. But if you’re selling a tool to businesses to solve a problem? I guess if you are exceptional at YouTube and or podcasting and you’ve done it before, you feel like you really want to do it and you’re going to do it in the specific vertical or the specific niche where you are going to serve customers and you really want to do it, then do it. But you’ve heard me say on this podcast many times for B2B SaaS, build your network, not your audience. Of all the companies we funded at TinySeed, 131 companies, it was a less than 5% that had an audience when they launched, or even as they grew. And I mean an audience that say followed the founder or followed the brand and was consuming all the content that they were putting out. By far, the vast majority of successful B2B SaaS companies are built on the top five, the big five, as I call them in my book: content, SEO, cold outreach, integrations partnerships, and ads. These are not as fun as starting a YouTube channel or podcast or starting a community of entrepreneurs or going on a podcast tour, which can also bring in people. There are marketing channels that you should do like eating spinach, and there are marketing channels that you want to do like eating ice cream. And I gave the example of someone, what was it, five, six episodes ago? About one entrepreneur who built a directory of freelancers and one entrepreneur who built a community of freelancers. And one of those was objectively a better choice. And you can go back and listen to that episode. It’s the most recent Rob solo adventure. But that’s where I have a podcast in a YouTube channel. But you shouldn’t necessarily do it because I do it because I’m not growing a B2B SaaS currently. Did I start a podcast or a YouTube channel for HitTail or Drip? No, neither of them. I happen to have this podcast going, but this has been a hobby now for 13 years. So if you want to, I guess, follow the indie hacker dream of, “Hey, I’m going to launch on Product Hunt, Hacker News Reddit, and then I’m going to have this audience on a podcast on YouTube channel, and I’m going to build a product that basically serves other indie hackers, and the churn’s going to be very high, so I need a really wide funnel. So I need to be one of the top two to five independent solo entrepreneurs.” Micropreneur is what I used to call this. I was doing this from 2005 to 2011. And if you want to be that individual, then yes, you should build an audience. But if that’s not going to be your approach, and you want to build a long-term sustainable, ambitious SaaS product that grows over time, and you can implement the stair step method of course, or you can build that B2B SaaS and then put to work the SaaS marketing approaches that I talk about in the SaaS Playbook or that you might find in a book like Traction or in Sean Ellis’s book Hacking Growth. So I guess to answer your question directly, do I think it would be worth working on a podcast or YouTube channel to build an audience in anticipation of releasing a new product? And if it’s an info product, then sure. And if it’s software, if it’s B2B SaaS, then no. I’m not saying it won’t move the needle at all. I’m saying there are so many other marketing approaches that you can invest time in that will create a flywheel and create a better opportunity for your SaaS to grow. I will admit the audience first approach I think is amazing for info products, for courses, for anything that relies on a personality. But we talk about audience first. What about SEO first? What about cold outreach first? What about pay-per-click advertising first? What about content first? What about partnerships and integrations first? These marketing approaches can be built in advance of building a product. I have a couple of founder friends who I mention on the show pretty regularly that built up flywheels, not of an audience, but of other marketing approaches before they even launched a product. And it gave them an incredible, basically, a slingshot effect when they actually brought the product to market. So thanks for those questions. I hope my thoughts were helpful. At the sound of the tone, this episode of Startups for the Rest of Us has come to a close. Thank you so much for joining me again this week and every week. I’m Rob Walling, signing off from episode 676.","PublishedAt":"August 29, 2023","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-676-exit-valuations-choosing-between-ideas-and-more-listener-questions"},{"Title":"Episode 675 | Storytelling as a Sales Superpower (Book Recommendation)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 675 | Storytelling as a Sales Superpower (Book Recommendation)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34:03\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 34:03 | Recorded on August 12, 2023\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 675, Rob Walling interviews Stephen Steers, author of “Superpower Storytelling.” They discuss Stephen’s experience in selling and teaching startups how to sell better.

This week I have a great conversation with Stephen Steers. He’s the author of the new book, Superpower Storytelling: A Tactical Guide to Telling the Stories You Need to Lead, Sell, and Inspire. We get a lot of pitches from authors wanting to promote their book on startups for the rest of us, and frankly, we don’t interview almost all of them, but Stephen is someone that we sought out based on his resume, his experience, and frankly the quality of the book that he’s written. This is another one of those short and sweet manuscripts, 150 pages, so you can read it in an afternoon or on an airplane, and he really focuses on how to shape stories around selling, around positioning, around talking to prospects, getting customers excited to buy, and then even has some tips at the end of the book about how to be the most interesting person in a room, some thoughts on humor because as you’ll hear in the interview, one of Stephen’s hobbies is standup comedy. But what I like about Stephen’s experience is he has boots-on-the-ground experience selling and then as a consultant teaching startups how to sell better and he’s put that experience into the book. So with that, let’s dive into our conversation. Stephen, thanks so much for joining me on the show.  Stephen Steers:Thank you for having me, Rob. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.  Rob Walling:Yeah, so we were talking offline and you mentioned that you had recognized my name vaguely and Start Small, Stay Small. That’s such a cool connection. You read it years ago?  Stephen Steers:Yeah, I don’t remember how I came up to it. I think it was 2016, 2017, something like this during my wantrepreneur stage, thinking about frameworks and everybody’s raising all this money in venture capital, and I was like, “I don’t have a good idea. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to start,” and somebody mentioned the book to me, I bought a copy, and it just really succinctly brought out how you could bootstrap, ways to think about accountability, goal setting, and just there was no fluff, which I really enjoyed, and I have to say, especially in the venture space and startups, everything’s sexy and fluffy and all this other stuff and this was like, “Nope, here’s how you do it. Here’s how it works, here’s why it’s going to work. Here’s what I’ve done,” and an incredible book, and just funnily, as we mentioned at the start, I actually did a book review of it on my YouTube channel in the very early days, and it’s one of my higher-rated views on my tiny YouTube channel, so thank you for writing it and it’s still singing out there in the universe.  Rob Walling:That’s great, man, and it’s such a trip how these things happen ’cause it’s purely we found you, I think producer Xander probably, or producer Ron, found a YouTube video of you doing some talks on sales, B2B sales, a lot in software, and anytime we, we being MicroConf and this podcast, can find just a new name, a new voice talking about these things. There are only so many of us and it does get old hearing from the same people, including me over time and anytime I can bring someone in who’s an expert on sales, who’s an expert on pricing, who’s an expert on branding, who’s an expert on positioning, marketing, whatever it may be, product, I love having that conversation, so I’m really glad to have you on the show today.  Stephen Steers:Thanks again for having me.  Rob Walling:Speaking of books, you just wrote your own, Superpower Storytelling, and it’s a book about how to learn… Well, I’m going to summarize it and you tell me what I miss. It’s about how to tell your story of your company, how to tell your story of your company’s mission and how that can help you sell both to prospects, sell your actual software, if you want to raise investment, how to sell to investors, how to sell to your internal team to keep them motivated, and how to sell to potential hires because to convince someone to leave their job and come work, “Hi, I’m a four-person company, come be employee number five,” right, it’s always a selling job. Did I do a decent job? What did I miss in terms of the manuscript?  Stephen Steers:Pretty much on it. The only thing I would add is it’s not just your company, it’s about you because the most interesting thing about what you do is who you are. So there’s plenty of developers who can code like the wind, but you and your specific story and why this problem and what you want to actually build is what enables the right people to be like, “You know what? Yeah, I’ll quit my corporate job and be employee number five because you’ve really outlaid this thing in the right way. I need to be a part of this.” So storytelling is one of the vehicles that really helps with that for sure.  Rob Walling:And so someone listening to this, let’s say a left-brain developer type who is cranking out code and getting some traction, maybe with a co-founder, 10K a month, 20K a month, they might be thinking, “Well, why do I need a story? Why can’t I just solve a problem? My software solves scheduling problems for hair salons and I’ve landed 50 hair salons,” and I really haven’t told them a story and I’m just here to fix it.  Stephen Steers:Why?  Rob Walling:So what’s the impetus? Yeah, why? What’s the why here?  Stephen Steers:Yeah, why the heck would I tell a story? I think that’s a great question and the main reason I think a story works really well is because this is something I’ve seen across the board with the hundreds, if not thousands of startups I’ve encountered or worked with, especially developers, so no shade on you guys. You guys are brilliant. You can do things that I can’t do yet. People who develop generally think that people care about the product, which they do, but not before they care about what problem it solves for them, so when you’re solving a problem for somebody, if I’m not a developer and I run a hair salon, my problems are probably I want more customers, I want a higher amount of money that I get from each customer, I want to be able to follow up with them and invite them in and enable them to tell other people about how well I cut their hair. Telling me, the salon owner, the story of how you met Sally, who had the worst time finding customers and keeping her bookkeeping straight and how when you met Sally, she was at X revenue and having this much stress, and now after of when you got your software and how Sally’s able to hire more people, get another franchise going or something, that’s an outcome that me as a listener, a story that I want to see myself in. So there’s a quote I really, really like. I mentioned this in the book. It’s by a guy named Horace in the ancient Greek times, he has a proper Greek name, I just don’t remember it off the top of my head, but it says, “You need only change the name and you are the subject of the story,” so if you’re selling anything, no matter how great your product is, I don’t care about it until you show me the outcome your product’s going to help me get to, and telling me a story about that outcome, that’s when you really start to resonate on a human level and you start to get someone into an emotional state, which is how 95% of purchasing decisions are made. So you can solve a problem, you’re great at it, tell me about how you did that for somebody else in the form of a story and you’re going to get not only more resonance with the market, but they’re going to be able to tell other people the same story and then get you referrals and put business in front of you and your company and your story does the work for you instead of just you making more product. That’s what I’ve seen happen,  Rob Walling:Right, and that’s the magic of stories, right? I read Made to Stick by the Heath brothers, Chip and Dan Heath, I believe. They talk about how stories are so memorable and so if I tell you a bunch of facts right now and you need to go convince someone else at your company because you need three people to buy in to buy the software.  Stephen Steers:Seven, usually.  Rob Walling:Seven, you’re not going to remember the facts. But if I tell you a story, they can at least halfway retell the story, right, in a reasonable way.  Stephen Steers:Exactly, yeah, and I think it’s 60 to 70% of information is retained when told through story. Hilarious to cite a factoid to tell that, but you get the point.  Rob Walling:Makes sense, yeah. And so folks listening to this, you’ve written a book on this topic. What’s your background that got you here? I know, I mean, you and I were talking offline, you’re a sales consultant, you help a lot of B2B companies grow and you obviously have a lot of experience in that, but I guess it’s like this is the question I often, my second slide of every presentation I do is, why should you listen to me? So teeing you up here.  Stephen Steers:Do you want the long version or of the fun version?  Rob Walling:Let’s do the fun version.  Stephen Steers:The fun version, okay. So I started in sales probably eight or nine years ago just doing an SDR, which is a sales development representative. I was the cold-calling guy, sending all the emails, sending all of the communications to set meetings for an account executive. I say it’s the equivalent of setting up somebody else for all the dates and they get to have all the fun on the dates and everybody else is getting laid but you. It was a very difficult job. I learned a lot and I didn’t have as much training as I wanted and I was vocal about not having training and eventually I got let go of the company and I got a note from the founder about how he saw I got the short end of the stick with management, with territory, and with verticals, but he hoped I had a great time at the company, and I laughed about this many years later because it’s like, “Man, you knew that this was going wrong. Why didn’t you do something about it?” So over that time, I got into other startups where I was selling software. I got into the consulting side, was running sales at a consulting company, and it was clear that lots of startups had the exact same issue. So my general mission, why should people trust me? I hope you do. But again, it comes from almost a decade’s worth of experience selling myself and failing at selling because I didn’t have the frameworks and scenarios that I now teach people to have. So in essence, I think a lot of people, one of the ways people start companies is to be the help they didn’t have and that’s very much why I do it because I work with developers every day. I’m a scrum master too, so I actually, like developers, I used to go and sit on the scrum meetings and just learn how you’re talking about the product. Are we building this the right way? What does a roadmap really mean? If I’m going to be selling this, somebody wants this feature, I can speak in a very educated way about, “Actually, that’s probably two years down the line and here’s why,” and that built a lot more trust for me in a sales perspective. So anyway, why should people trust me? I’ve made a lot of mistakes. I talk about some of them in the books, and I think it’s all in service of you being the best founder at whatever you can be based on leveraging who you are is the most interesting part about what it is you do.  Rob Walling:And if folks want to pick up the book, they can go to stephensteers.com. It’s S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S-T-E-E-R-S dot com / superpower storytelling book. We will link that up in the show notes, of course. I’ll mention that again towards the end, but I want folks to, if it’s, “Shut up and take my money already,” you should be able to get there. Stephen, you just mentioned frameworks, right, mental frameworks. I’m a huge fan of them. I love reading them because they allow me to understand things quicker. To me, it’s like a story that’s a little more technical. It’s like a shortcut to getting to an idea. I can see it in my head. You have a framework called the AREA framework and you talk about how powerful storytelling has clear structure, stories have arcs, ups and downs, et cetera. It always feels weird for someone to read your book to you. It’s good stuff.  Stephen Steers:I’ll take it.  Rob Walling:So you have A, R, E, and A. Do you want to talk us through what those mean and why they’re in that order, basically?  Stephen Steers:Yeah, absolutely. One of the things I often hear from lots of people who get on the phone or start selling or do presenting or go on podcasts is they don’t know what to say and then they may get stumped in a situation where they don’t actually know the answer or have to think. The AREA framework is named aptly because it covers all scenarios that you may be needing to communicate something and don’t want to sound silly. So A stands for “angle,” so you’re going to state your angle on an issue. Let’s say it’s bootstrapping a company is better than raising venture capital. That’s our angle. We then followed up with R, which stands for “reason,” and then you can offset a reason to anything to say, “The reason that bootstrapping a company is better than raising venture capital is it gives you a lot more freedom of your business model.” Then we’d followed up with E, which is an example. So an example, this is one of the best places to put in your stories or your situations and scenarios and make it real to you. So it would say something like, “A quick example of this would be my own company, so because of the fact that I didn’t have to actually take on venture funding, I was able to actually go out to the market, validate my idea using this start small stay small framework by actually talking to customers and pre-selling my ideas, and because I was able to pre-sells, actually to get able to get revenue into the door to then reinvest and build my company versus having to hope that somebody got it and bringing that over to a venture capitalist hoping that they would send me some money, and that’s why I believe that bootstrapping a company is better than getting venture capital.” So A again is restating your angle. So A-R-E-A, AREA, angle, reason, evidence, and restates your angle, that’ll give you a framework to make any point you want to make and you can also think while you’re speaking and you don’t sound like you’re thinking when you’re speaking and I made all of that up off the top of my head as we went.  Rob Walling:I was going to give you a clap on that ’cause yeah, it was just off the cuff. We did not prepare for this, folks, so that is, I think, you embracing your own storytelling framework ’cause you just told a story right off the cuff. It’s pretty impressive, man.  Stephen Steers:That’s it. That’s what it’ll teach you.  Rob Walling:Yeah. All right, so we have AREA, and obviously, you dive deep into that. You have almost a whole chapter on it in the book. There’s another section that caught my eye and it is about the problem stack. It’s a little later in the book. Can you talk us through that? ‘Cause I read it and I was like, “This is really…” It was that thing. You know when you read something you’re like, “Oh, of course,” but no one’s ever said it this way before? So you want to talk us through what the problem stack is? It’s during your sales process, right?  Stephen Steers:Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, it is not my model. I learned it from a guy named Taki Moore through one of my mentors, Scott Sambucci, so they helped me get that, but it’s super important, and it’s on three levels. So when we think about solving a problem, right, these developers, they build incredible software, they got it to 10 to 20K a month. They’re kind of figuring out, “Well, look, we could stay here, it’s lifestyle business, but if we want to grow this and move this and make this SaaS something that really changes our lives and our future generations and all this other stuff, we need to be thinking about problems in different ways.” So the problem stack outlines that and the three levels are the following. So it’s the known said problem. So for an example, it would be a salon owner has trouble retaining clients or getting clients back. It’s the problem that they’re going to talk about openly. It’s not a secret. Everybody knows this is a thing, no one’s hiding this. The second level of the problem is the known unsaid problem. This is the problem where maybe you as a developer would only talk to really trusted people about that problem because it’s something that maybe you’re a little ashamed of or you’re just not sure if it’s the right thing and you don’t want to put yourself out there that way. If you can in your marketing or in your storytelling unlock a problem like that, you’re getting people to be like, “Oh, you understand me,” so that’s the second level of the problem. And then the third, the most important and probably the most difficult one to find, especially if you’re in the software space, but if you can find this one you’re in for pay dirt is the unknown unsaid problem, and this is the problem that once you explain to people, to salon owners how this particular lack of software is causing them to not only lose clients, to lose good stylists, and to cause their rent to go up, once they see that problem and you’ve explained it to them, they can’t unsee it, so everything else in their business is now viewed through that lens. And again, if you can tell stories that unpack and help people go through this ascension ladder of understanding the problems that you can see because they can’t, you’re extremely valuable, and then everything is predicated on, “I need to solve this problem. Oh, my gosh, how did I not see this?” And I think storytelling is a nice, kind way to push people towards those outcomes, or rather invite people towards those outcomes with you as the logical person to solve those problems.  Rob Walling:Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

A lot of folks will go into the basement and just start coding. It’s like, “Ah, I think this will work,” and then they hope people find it and buy it, which doesn’t really happen to most of us. But when you take the idea of validating and you actually get out and talk to people if you ask the right questions, right, this is kind of why I love sales, I’m curious, I love to ask questions, and when you can find a word or phrase, and pardon the word choice here, but pick at the scab, “Tell me a bit more about that, why that?”, you’ll start to have people just tell you about where those levels of the problem are and what’s really important about leveraging your framework to validate ideas is the more people you talk to is the more patterns you see in the market, the more of a pattern you see in the market is where you’re building something that people will use and want to solve their problem with. Not only that, if you actually talk to people, you build relationships with people, so when you do have a ready product, you already have buyers, not the other way around, so I think leveraging that and talking to people and hearing them speak about the problem the right way, it’ll give you all the stories you need to tell in your marketing and it will give you the right words to use that resonate with the people who will actually buy your product and tell other people about it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, like that. And what you’re talking about is not just, it’s not just sales, it’s a mix of sales and almost customer development, it sounds like, where you’re getting feedback that’s probably going to impact what you build, how you build it, and how you sell it. Would you say that’s accurate?  Stephen Steers:I would absolutely say that’s accurate.  Rob Walling:And so I can imagine as a founder, there’s a lot of founders listening to this who are in this space, in this state where they’re like, “Ooh, I just don’t know what to build next,” and they are having these conversations and let’s say they get to the point where they are a bootstrap founder and they’re making 10K, 20K a month, they’re doing pretty well for themselves and they think, “You know what? I don’t like sales. I want to delegate. I want to delegate sales.” Do you have a sense or an opinion on when the founder themselves can start handing this off?  Stephen Steers:I do, and I don’t think your audience will like what I have to say, but I’m going to tell you the truth, that’s my goal here. So the way I think about it and the way I was taught to think about it is it really depends on your revenue scale, all right? So these aren’t hard and fast rules, per se, but this is how I would think about it. If you are in the zero to 300K, the only things you should be outsourcing are tasks that don’t have to do with sales. This is you doing bookkeeping, automation stuff. You should be doing all of the selling if you’re at that level. The only exception to any of these levels I’ll mention is if you have a ton of leads and you as the founder can’t take care of the volume, then it makes sense to outsource and I’ll explain a little bit more about why in just a second. The second level is 300K to a million. This is when you start to potentially outsource some sales. This would be where you’re outsourcing the appointment setting depending on your ticket, of course, and then customer success, so the fulfillment side and the onboarding and that stuff. From a million to 3 million, you actually can hire full-on salespeople. You run the process tip to tail and then you would manage them and then 3 million plus is when you’d hire a VP of sales who runs the whole thing and they just pass reporting on to you. The reason I say it needs to kind of be in that general level of zero to 300K, again, depending on what you sell is most people make the mistake of hiring sales too early. People don’t like selling, they want to get rid of it and they’re just like, “All right, you come in here and you do it,” and the problem with that is usually how I’ve seen with many startup founders, especially SaaS folks, they don’t document what worked well and how an actual deal should go through, literally from first contact to signed contract. They don’t have scripts, they don’t have templates for follow-up, they don’t have their products properly outlined in descriptions, and that might not sound like a lot, but you have to think, when I’ve been a rep, I’ve been hired to get into companies to sell, right, and then they give me a quota and I got to go out here and do my thing. And then when we dive into it’s like, “Well, why did customers buy this?” “Oh, we’re not sure.” “Okay. Well, who’s the ideal client for us?” “Well, the ones that have money.” “Okay, where do I find more of those?” “Well, that’s your job.” “Okay, I’ll take it. Fine.” But that’s not a sales job. That’s a business development job. And I think a lot of founders hire salespeople, but they’re actually hiring business development people because business development, my definition here, is the person who figures out what is sellable in the market, how the market’s talking about it, and what will make this solution commercially viable to be purchased. Once that process is run at least 10 times and we have recorded systemized versions, it doesn’t have to be anything special or fancy, but once we’ve documented that, now we can hire someone into sales, not before, because I’ve been hired into roles like that before and I wasn’t set up for success. I had some level of success ’cause I was very hungry, but that took money out of my pocket and out of the company’s pocket because they didn’t do the pre-work of saying, “Hey, you’re now part of the team. Here’s how we do it. Take this, study it, and come back with questions,” and everything’s laid out. So I would say to any founder, if you’re thinking about hiring for sales, kudos, make sure you’ve met certain thresholds, but at least have done it yourself 10 times and have that documented from tip to tail as much as you can so that when you do bring someone in, they’re there to make what you’ve already done better, not make what you haven’t done.  Rob Walling:In the book, you talk about the four reasons why businesses buy, so this is B2B, and the first is make more money, second is save money, the third is increase efficiency, and the fourth is to mitigate risk, and you give examples of each of those. Have you found that one of those is the best or better than others?  Stephen Steers:No, not at all, and the reason for that is I also cite a stat in there, I think it’s about seven people need to agree to buy a software solution. Again, this is probably in the SMB and enterprise space. If you’re talking about growing your SaaS, you want to get up to that. But let’s just say multiple people, more than one person needs to say yes to buying your software solution, right, which means each person in a company is going to have a slightly different metric or KPI that they’re shooting for in their role. So the CEO certainly cares about making more money, right, increasing the bottom line, whatever, the CFO’s probably going to want to save more money because they get comped on that bonus. Someone in a different department who’s going to be using your software wants to make it more efficient. So your software solution can do all of those things, but the key is to be able to tell a story about how your solution does each of those things, depending on who you’re talking to, because at the end of the day, we’re humans solving human problems in a business context and if you can talk to me as a human about how your solution helps me in my role, I’m listening, and that’s the reason you’re going to want to have and understand how your business does all of those things, depending on who you talk to ’cause it’s not just one size fits all. And that’s the other thing, we could talk more about this, too, but a consultative sale is asking the questions first and then being able to talk about how your solution ties to the outcomes that that person has based on the questions you asked.  Rob Walling:Let’s continue with that. Some listeners may not have ever heard the term “consultative sale.” How is that different than I’m selling whatever? What does that mean?  Stephen Steers:Yeah. Oh, man. I love this one. Sales is a four-letter word to most people, right? They hate doing it, they just want to stay as far away from it, and salespeople are icky and annoying and pushy and gross and I agree and that’s part of why I do what I do ’cause I want to be a difference in that and help people enjoy selling again. But consultative selling is, I think the first part of being a good consultative seller is how you open your call, right? So if you’re on the phone, I’ll give you an exact example of how I would open it. “Hey, Rob. Great to be here with you today. I have a super light framework for how I want to run this call. I want to learn a little bit more about you, ask some questions about you and your company, want to share a little bit about us and what we’re up to, and if there is room for a conversation for us to have about working together on anything we talk about today, I’m here for that as well. Is that fair?”  Rob Walling:Sounds good.  Stephen Steers:Boom. So what did I do there? I set up my next steps with talking about, “Hey, we’re going to talk about if this is a fit, we’re going to have that conversation at the end.” I don’t have to rush into a sale. I’ve also given you the out by asking for your permission on that. So a consultative seller sets the agenda, as it were, and then you ask questions that invite pain, if you will. “What’s agitating you? What’s going well? What’s not going well? Where do you want to go?” Then painting a picture of what the overall goals are of the business, why the person doesn’t have those things. And then after you’ve got that information, you can now speak accurately with truthful information to how your solution or solutions help solve the problems the person had. So that is a consultative sale and you’re not pushing it on it. We talked about, “You mentioned that you had this problem with your salons. Here’s how our solution can help that be a thing of the past.”  Rob Walling:And is consultative selling, in your opinion, is that the best way to sell, let’s say B2B SaaS to SMBs or enterprise?  Stephen Steers:I’m going to give you a consulting answer here, Rob. I think it depends, so it depends on your ticket price. Some folks I talk to, they sell something that’s $25 a month, you’re not getting on the phone for that. That’s not worth it. That’s more marketing and great content with storytelling, I think.  Rob Walling:It’s a funnel.  Stephen Steers:Yeah, it’s a funnel, right? If you’re selling something over a thousand, $2,000, you’re probably going to have someone who’s going to get on the phone and talk to you about it. I think a consultative sale is the best kind of sale because it doesn’t force people into decisions, it logically walks them and also emotionally walks them through why this is the best way to go forward. It’s not pushy. And again, this is another thing to think about, too, if you do get on the phone with folks and you’re pushy, that’s also a story they’re going to tell the market about you. “Oh, don’t talk to this guy. He was really just trying to close me really too hard. He was not consultative, he didn’t ask about my problems, and was just trying to get me to buy today. I felt really uncomfortable. Don’t do business with this person.” So I think it’s the best. That’s how I sell, and again, I think it’s also predicated on I might not be able to help you. Let’s find that out first. And I think sales is all about know, like, and trust and building a long-term relationship, so, “Hey, actually you know what, Rob? Based on everything you said, I’m not the right person to solve these problems. I may know somebody, which I’m happy to introduce you to, but I wanted to be very upfront and direct about that.” And most people are like, “What? You’re not going to try to …? Really? What, are you serious?” And that’s how you build trust and you get people to be like, “You know what? I wasn’t a fit, but I know 10 people who would be a good fit for your business.” That’s a great way to get referrals if you could do it the right way.  Rob Walling:And it feels good. It makes sales feel legit and just like you’re being honest. I like that.  Stephen Steers:Yep.  Rob Walling:So as we wrap up, I want to talk about, I think it’s the last section of your book. It’s about humor. And you have in your bio and you told me offline that you do standup comedy, you’re a standup comedian, and so I imagine humor is a pretty important part of your life, but I’m curious in business context, in selling, have you used humor to your advantage? And the second part of that is do you think people can learn to be funny? Or what is the process there? ‘Cause I sometimes try to be funny and I find out that I’m not. So just talk me through that. Has it been an advantage to you and how can folks take advantage of that?  Stephen Steers:First thing to say is sometimes I try to be funny and I’m not either, so that’s what the world will tell you.  Rob Walling:Nice.  Stephen Steers:But it certainly has worked to my advantage in some ways, especially in workshop settings. You mentioned at the start of this, it’s really cool to get new perspectives from different types of people, right? You’ve heard the same thing over and over and over again. I don’t want to say a lot of the information I share or most people share is the same, but we can definitely change the recipe and so what I find is if I can give you the hard medicine of, “Hey, you’re not making enough money to outsource sales, but we can make it funny and interesting,” you take the lesson in a better and different way. It goes home with you in a positive way. So I think as far as humor is concerned, the way to leverage it is to, it helps people build relationships like, “Oh, that guy was funny.” It helps me get asked back for workshops like, “Oh, that was fun. I enjoyed that. Let’s come back again.” Right, so that’s the first, it’s inviting, humor is. As far as people who aren’t funny, that’s okay. There’s a difference between being funny and using humor. So being funny, right, you could think of your favorite standup comedian or your favorite sitcom or whatever it is and these people are just cutting up and you can’t hold it in, that’s a very different thing than telling jokes. So jokes are kind of a structured thing. I go into this a little bit in the book, and again, I’m still learning as well, but I think especially, I wrote one in there about SaaS founders, I think, for the joke. But if you use humor in a self-deprecating way, people love it. It’s like, “Oh, you don’t take yourself too seriously.” It’s a good way to bridge. So I think for people who aren’t funny, I go over a slight framework in there in the book. I think the acronym is the best and fastest way to turn something funny, even if you’re not funny, and you can use it in stride in your talks or in the way you sell to people because it’s an acronym they might know. Right, that’s the easiest way, and I think it’s the easiest way because there’s the innate idea of what they think it already means, and humor, good humor, good jokes, leverage, misdirection, so the fact that you’ve changed it automatically creates a dissonance where there’s room for a laugh and a chuckle. So I think everybody can use it. Again, if it’s off-brand for you to be funny, really think about how that works. But I find it is one of the coolest instruments to build good relationships with people, and at the end of the day, people smiling and enjoying whatever it is they’re doing with you, that’s what we look for.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yeah, it raises the game of a conference talk of a workshop of a sales call. And for the record, I have your SaaS joke here. I love this. You have a whole explanation of how you construct the joke and why and you say, “Let’s make it self-deprecating,” specifically, and so the joke is, “I’m a computer nerd. I’ve built software since the age of 12. It’s hard to get a date. I live a SaaS founder lifestyle. To some, it means software as a service. But in my experience, SaaS means sometimes alone, always single,” and then what I love is you have this comment that says, “Not bad, not great, but it’s a start,” and it’s real self-reflective, so I appreciate that. That whole last chapter is about, right, or maybe it’s second to last, but it’s about how to think about and construct jokes when you walk through your process of, “Here are the facts. How do we try to make those funny?” Which I think it’s a pretty cool thing to have in a sales book.  Stephen Steers:And then adding one other level to that, you’re going to fail at it most of the time with jokes. It’s just how it works, unfortunately. But I’ll say this about it, I love standup comedy, I have for many years, but I think if you are a founder, it’s one of the things you should absolutely try and here’s why. As a founder, you’re mostly alone. You’ve got to figure out what information is important information and take it back and use it and you always have to stand on your square and own where you are, whether you’re winning or losing. And I think entrepreneurship is really a feedback game. If you’re having the right type of marketing, you’re making the right type of actions, the market will respond in kind. The fastest place you get a response in any performative art is standup comedy. If it’s funny, people are going to laugh. If it’s not funny, it’s going to be crickets, and I think taking those two dichotomies, you bring that back into your process and you say, “All right, no, I think that was funny. I need to try it another way.” Or, “This feature is really important to the market. I know it’s worth something. Maybe I need to ask a better question to the next customer to understand how they would use something like this.” So I think they’re very analogous to each other and it’s just fun, so I highly recommend it.  Rob Walling:It’s like finding your sales pitch is like audience testing and trying to find your tight five, right? That’s it.  Stephen Steers:That’s exactly it, yeah.  Rob Walling:Amazing. Stephen Steers, thank you so much for joining me on the show today.

I’m Rob Walling, and this is Hot Take Tuesday. That’s the show format where I invite Tracy Osborn and Elnar Vollset onto the podcast, and we discuss recent news stories that impact our bootstrapped and mostly bootstrapped SaaS community. In this episode, we talk about how SparkToro has paid back their investors. We discuss a piece that tries to talk through the pros and cons or really just the cons of raising venture capital. Then we look at a blog post from Fly.io where they talk about how they raised a bunch of money and why they did that. Finally, we talk a bit about Twitter and X.com or whatever we call it these days. Before we dive into that, my book, The SaaS Playbook, is now available in most places that greater books are sold at least online. SaaSplaybook.com is a place to go if you want to support me directly, and I’m selling PDF, EPUB, audio and paperback copies from the site. Paperback copies, unfortunately, I’m only able to ship in the United States, due to the unnecessary complexity and cost of our worldwide shipping and customs situation. But the book is also now available on amazon.com in Kindle and paperback, and it should be available on Audible as an audiobook. If you go to SaaSplaybook.com, buy directly from me, of course, that’s where I don’t give a 30% to 75% cut. You heard that right, 30% to 75% cut depending on the format. I actually did not know that on Audible, they take 75% of the royalties, even though I wrote the book, I own it, I recorded it, produced it and all that. But if I agreed to not sell it anywhere else, they only took 60%, so I get 40%. If I wanted to sell it somewhere else, such as on my own website for example, then they take 75%, but it is what it is. Buy it in whatever format suits you best. I really appreciate your support. This book distills all the stuff I’ve learned about building SaaS companies, where they’re bootstrapped, mostly bootstrapped. Or even I had a friend of mine who’s working at a venture-backed startup, and he said that if it’s SaaS, it applies to you. Another one of my friends is the CEO of a SaaS company with about 10 people, and he bought it for his entire team. He said, “I know you wrote this aimed at founders, but I actually think it can give everyone in an organization an idea of how your SaaS company runs.” Buy one, buy 10, hand them out to your team, SaaSplaybook.com or amazon.com. With that, let’s dive in to this week’s Hot Take Tuesday. Here we are back again, another Hot Take Tuesday. Tracy Osborn, @tracymakes on X.com, On Twitter. That is our first story. Thanks for coming back, hanging out on the pod with me.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah, happy to be here. Excited to rant and yell at Elnar and have Elnar and I yell, and you keep us on track as much as possible.  Rob Walling:Indeed.  Tracy Osborn:As per usual.  Rob Walling:That’s the wrangling job I have. Yep. Elnar Vollset, coming in live from Europe. How are things, sir?  Einar Vollset:Things are good. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be back and ranting and raving as usual.  Rob Walling:Excellent. We have a good story docket today. First one is Elon Musk. We’ll see how well this ages. This episode goes live in a couple of weeks and knowing Elon, things will change from day-to-day. But as of right now, breaking news, Elon Musk replaces the Twitter bird logo with X, with an X that, I don’t know, it just looks like an X. Then X.com/robwalling leads to my Twitter account. Is it like a rename? I’m not actually sure what’s happening, but it’s rocking the world and people on Twitter are eye-rolling and looking to Threads. @tracymakes, what is your take on this story?  Tracy Osborn:I have some fun facts. A, the X that they’re using is literally, it’s one of the Unicode characters.  Rob Walling:Cool.  Tracy Osborn:It tells you some of the thoughtfulness that went into this start of a rebrand, very Elon Musky. It’s also interesting to note, that I don’t know the whole story on this. I just remember reading some thoughts on this, is that this is something that Elon wanted to do in PayPal days, so rename PayPal to X.com. That obviously didn’t happen. It’s clearly a dream of Elon to have a product that is under the X.com umbrella, and here is his opportunity to do it. There’s some implications here. Is it going to be are we going to be not calling it Twitter anymore? Is it going to be X.com? Is it going to be just X? Are we going to have tweets? Are we going to have X’s, which is what he said on his account recently?  Rob Walling:X’s, all my exes live in Texas though, don’t they? Sorry, might need to cut that. I love it, Elnar, just chuckling.  Tracy Osborn:I think you could cut it or you could leave it in.  Rob Walling:It’s off to a great start.  Tracy Osborn:Because it is a good point of how we have this vernacular we’ve been using for how many years has Twitter been around now? We’ve gotten these words, they’re in the dictionary, I want to say. Tweets are in the dictionary, the word tweet. For any company, that would be an absolute branding win. It’s really interesting to see this bull in a China shop approach continuing to happen, now with moving on of such a brand and such a part of our ecosystem in the tech world. Now making a lot of changes under the hood, and now making these very public faces’ changes that are going to make it more complicated for people to use it. That actually might be the point, I don’t know. This literally started happening last night for me, so I’m still wrapping my brain around it. It’s interesting, I’ll say.  Rob Walling:It’s a social media platform that we’re all familiar with. Sometimes when there is a rebrand, I’m like, “This makes sense. It needs a refresh.” It needs a new name is always a stretch, but new branding, new updated design or whatever. This obviously came out of nowhere for a lot of people, and I don’t tend to get emotional about these things. Remember when Figma sold to Adobe and people are like, “Oh my God, this is the worst, I’m so angry they sold this out”? I just don’t care, even as a Figma user.  Tracy Osborn:But were you an Adobe user? Because the whole point of Figma is people getting off. I say this as a designer, whereas everyone’s just like, “I want to get off Adobe,” and then Adobe pulls it back in.  Rob Walling:I’m just using it as an example of I tend to not be emotional about these things. I just don’t care that much. I haven’t been up in arms.  Einar Vollset:Unlike Tracy, clearly.  Rob Walling:I haven’t been upset about, I don’t really care what Elon’s doing. Twitter’s fine, but rebranding it to X, I think, is a (censored) terrible business decision. It doesn’t make any sense to me. Unless Elon’s playing 3D chess, which I don’t know, he hasn’t really shown us that he thinks too far ahead on these things. It seems like a genuine death knell, a shot in the foot of something to just rename it like this. When I saw it, I had to read it again and then I literally was like, “Is it April 1st?” This is a great April Fools joke, but it’s just crazy to think about this. The other thing, I want to kick it to Elnar in a second, but it reminded me, I have read the story of PayPal and stuff, and I knew X.com. X.com I believe was actually Elon ran a company called X.com and they merged with PayPal, because they were competing and they were flailing. It was like Peter Thiel and a couple other, the PayPal Mafia, a couple other folks were at PayPal, they were X and they merged. He has that X.com domain obviously, but it seems like it’s his hammer, that everything’s a nail when X.com is your hammer. But it reminds me of this story, Kevin Smith, he’s a film director, he told of this producer, John Peters. Kevin Smith was going to direct Superman Lives 15 plus years ago. John Peters says, “Well, you can do it.” I’m paraphrasing here but, “You can do it, but I really want a big, mechanical spider at the end of the film.” Kevin Smith’s like, “What? What are you talking about? This makes no sense. There is no spider in the Lord of Superman.” It’s this great story, you can Google it, see it on YouTube. Kevin Smith either decides not to do it or isn’t allowed to do it. Then two years later, he’s watching a movie produced by John Peters called Wild Wild West with Will Smith and Kevin Kline. He’s like, “I’m watching the movie, and at the end, there’s a huge, mechanical spider.” He’s like, “The dude just had one play.” He wanted that to be in a movie. This a little bit [inaudible].  Tracy Osborn:One play or one dream?  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Tracy Osborn:It could go for both this guy and Elon. He’s like, “This is the dream and we’re finally going to achieve it one way or another.”  Rob Walling:Super funny. Elnar, what are your thoughts before I move on to the next story?  Einar Vollset:Yeah. I obviously have the view that the vernacular is peculiar. What to the X? I don’t know that that works, but I do think on the flip side, I think Elon views Twitter as it was when he bought it as a stepping stone. Everyone I think is always currently, a lot of people anyway, are thinking of what happens to Twitter under Elon, as how much is he (censored) it up and how much money is he burning, and where did all the advertisers go and all this crap? But fundamentally, if you see how he talks about it, the reason why you might want to do a drastic rebranding like this, is if you want people to think of it as a different thing than what it was or something additional. I certainly think in the universe of messaging type apps, it’s no big secret that I was never a big fan of the previous CEO. I think he left a lot of things on the table and never really did much of anything with it, which is why it ended up getting acquired by Elon. But there is things like if you look to Asia, like the big messaging apps that are Asia and all the e-commerce that gets done there, inside the messaging apps in both China and India particularly, but also Japan. I think there’s an option here that if he’s really going aggressively after it being more than just Twitter and different than just mostly people shouting about things on Twitter, then a rebrand might make sense. That’s the other side of where I see it. I think it could go in two ways. Either this gets abandoned almost by the time this is published, or it’s a part of something that’s more towards making it ubiquitous, all day, everyday payment transactions, all that stuff, which I think is where he wants to go with Twitter in general.  Rob Walling:Right. The rebrand is to reposition. In essence, X is a generic name, which could be both good and bad, right?It’s bad because it’s generic, but it’s good in the sense that you can be anything you want it to be at that point.  Tracy Osborn:In this vacuum, well, in this ecosystem of people wanting Twitter to be as is, as it always has been and never to change. Now we have Threads and Bluesky, and all these services are trying to jump into that void, which I think that was going to be the next topic. I thought I’d just jump right over to it, which is interesting.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Our next topic is Threads, but Mastodon is not it. This is just not going to happen. There’s just no way.  Tracy Osborn:I’m sorry, Mastodon. I tried to and I had to change. I didn’t like the default server I was on, and I’m a techie person with a lot of experience with computers. I went through all the articles, was like, “This is how you can change your server from whatever they’re at.” I think I was the default one to more of a subgroup, and you can change servers, and supposedly bring all of your followers and everything over, and it just never worked for me. That was a death knell for me, because I was just like, “As a computer savvy person, I could not figure out how to change things on Mastodon.” Yeah. No, thank you.  Rob Walling:Mastodon is that story of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, because when Twitter, if it actually had its act together in the way that maybe Bluesky or Threads does, I think. I’m on both of them, but I’m not really using them. But Mastodon was the one everyone flocked to, and it just fumbled the ball so badly with the user experience and the need to be a techie. Threads though, I’m curious to get both your takes on it. I, of course, have an Instagram handle only, so I can read my wife’s posts and some stuff about collecting comic books and this and that, but I don’t do anything. I literally have one or two posts total, but obviously I’ve been able to reserve my username on Threads. When I look at it, I’m like, “Well, this is pretty much what everyone’s posting on Instagram.” That’s what it looks like to me and most of them have pictures and it looks the same. I also am never an early adopter of social media. Frankly, I wish I was not an adopter at all, but eventually I do have to do it for work and such. I’m not the early adopter, so I’m probably not the right one to weigh in, but it doesn’t seem to have much there. Elnar, are you on Threads? What are your thoughts on it, in terms of it potentially replacing Twitter or becoming one of the big three or four social networks?  Einar Vollset:I think it has a chance. I don’t think it has a big chance. My view of it when it first came out was partly laziness. I’m like, “I’ve been on Twitter for long enough, that it could probably get a driver’s license in a number of states.” Already this year, we went through Mastodon and then Bluesky and then some other crap. I don’t know, I just am not willing to just futz around with all sorts of things. Then on top of that, I tend to very carefully segment my social media. On Twitter, I am basically the argumentative asshole shit posting at the intersection of AI and finance, but then I also have an Instagram account, but Instagram account is locked down. Basically, pretty much nobody is allowed to follow me. It’s like family and friends effectively. The content that I put on Instagram is very different than the stuff that I put on Twitter. Believe it or not, I’m not a complete psychopath among my friends and family in person, unlike on Twitter. I think that’s maybe the problem that Facebook name Meta has, which is this notion that people, particularly when it’s like you can’t delete your Threads account without also deleting your Instagram account. There’s some weird, conceptual segmentation of how to behave that, I think, people will struggle with. That’s probably the reason why I think it may not actually do very well. I think it’ll find a sub-niche in some way, shape or form. Just actually like I think I’m sure Mastodon, people who hate Elon more than they hate configuring servers, they will definitely stay on Mastodon. You know what I mean? It’s a big enough market that it’ll take some share. Do I think it’s likely to outcompete Twitter? No. I think Elon is more likely to ruin Twitter himself, than Threads is to outcompete him.  Tracy Osborn:Amen. I think it’s a little bit sad that we basically have old Twitter, which is now X or going to be X, or perhaps it’s going to be X. We have new Twitter or the new Twitters, so Bluesky, backed by Dorsey, who was what? He was the founder of Twitter, right? I’m remembering that correctly, Jack Dorsey?  Einar Vollset:One of the founders. Yeah.  Rob Walling:Kind of.  Einar Vollset:Kind of, yeah.  Rob Walling:If you read Hatching Twitter, and he’s a first engineer person who was later named, but anyways, for all intents.  Tracy Osborn:But basically it’s like old guard Twitter, creating new Twitter, and then we have new Meta, like Instagram and Facebook jumping in. It makes me sad that there isn’t, I don’t know, something else out there. Something from a non-established social media company, but I guess it’s impossible in this ecosystem we’re in right now. But I feel like this is going to create these separate communities that we didn’t have on Twitter. Or people were using Twitter and they were using Facebook, they’re generally using both. But if Twitter gets fragmented into the Elon stands with X and then we have the Instagram folks, which is a very huge community, especially I think around for women or business communities, or people doing products. One, they’re all using Instagram as their primary social media tool. Then they can be pushed into this Threads network. Then you have Bluesky, where it’s as of right now, it’s basically a one-to-one clone to Twitter. That one I feel like had some growing pains that they had those invites. For me, that invite system really just killed all motivation or any momentum I had for joining that network. But I feel like they’re going to attract a certain group of people, maybe people who wanted the old Twitter who are not on Instagram. Then you have these three separate social media, text-based updates platforms. Then for folks who are building businesses that need to get their information out to their customers, before they could just use Twitter. Or if things like, I don’t know, the accounts for volcano or earthquake detection or something like that, you could follow things being like, “There was an earthquake in so-and-so and there’s on Twitter,” and it’s like what network is it going to go on? I don’t know. Is it going to stay on X because of things going on? I don’t know. I feel like there’s this weird shakeup, this weird creating of different ecosystems, that people are going to stop posting on one and only on the other. I think we’re going to lose something in this medium-term period of time on easy access information and knowing where to go to places. That makes me a little bit [inaudible].  Rob Walling:It’s a shakeup.  Tracy Osborn:It’s a shakeup and it’s sad. It’s like we got so far in the internet, we had these ways of doing things and there’s going to be a shakeup. In the medium term is going to be really hard and weird and we’ll see what emerges in the future. We went from MySpace to Facebook, so who knows what the Facebook for RMA space is now.  Einar Vollset:Yeah. I don’t know that probably one of the problems with Jack Dorsey’s Twitter, was that I actually think probably more businesses make more money on Instagram and on Pinterest than on Twitter. I never think they managed to really in any meaningful way, monetize that. There are some kind of businesses that might thrive on Twitter, but I think it’s a very small sliver compared to anything else. Yeah, I don’t know.  Rob Walling:Yeah, their ad network’s not great. They’re so far behind.  Tracy Osborn:Prepare yourselves for a shakeup and it’s going to be a while. As business owners for people in SaaS, I think that it might be hard to figure out what social media platform you use for your business in the short term, to figure out how to find customers if you’re using social media. But hopefully something will come into place like a new industry leader at some point.  Rob Walling:I’m just going to hang out on the sidelines like I usually do and wait until all the desks settles and be like, “That’s who won, or there’s three now.” What TinySeed company hits all three APIs and allows me to post the same thing to all three? That’s essentially what it’s going to be.  Tracy Osborn:We had that before with Tumblr and Twitter and a few other things back in the day, too. There were other networks, other than Twitter, that people were posting in one place. They didn’t automatically share to all those things. Honestly, we need a tool like that now.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and it’ll get built. Maybe Postpone right now goes after Reddit. You can imagine Grant, a Chinese seed company, Postpone adding that functionality. There’s probably not a Threads API, it can’t be yet, right? I don’t think they would have it out yet. Anyways, let’s move onto our next story. Actually, our next couple stories are about funding. The first one I want to touch on, is a tweet that I sent out about three weeks ago. In it, I said, “It’s super impressive to watch Rand Fishkin and Casey Henry execute on their vision of SparkToro, not only their vision of the product, but of how they wanted to operate their company. They didn’t raise VC and opted instead to raise a small round from 35 investors. I’m one of them, whom they have just paid back in full. Future returns are expected to come through dividends.” Then I sarcastically say, “Profit, what a novel idea for a startup.” For what it’s worth, their investment terms served as the basis for how we invest via TinySeed. Huge congrats to them and their team. Just so folks are clear, basically Casey and Rand didn’t want to raise Venture and go on the venture track because Rand’s been down that road before. If you’ve read his book, Lost and Founder, he has pretty strong opinions on how that basically failed. They built a great business and venture ruined it, is the lesson from his experience there. When they came out with SparkToro, it’s like, “Well, let’s just sell equity in the company, and however much percentage of that you own, we’ll kick off dividends.” That became one component of TinySeed. Now, what we’ve actually found within TinySeed, a little known fact, it’s about 80/20. When TinySeed founders come in, I used to ask, “Do you want to grow as fast as possible, be the ambitious bootstrapper and sell for, usually it’s enough money you never have to work again? Or would you prefer to run your company for long-term, make it profitable and pull off dividends?” It’s about 80% that want to sell, might even be a little more than that now, but it is the option. That’s one of the advantages of a TinySeed. In Indie.vc, depending on which terms, I believe Indie uses different sets of terms in different versions and stuff. But really Rand and Casey wanted to grow this business on their own terms. Just because they paid investors back, someone approached me and said, “They bought you out.” It’s like, “No, no, no, no. We got our money back and now they can take raises and there’s a bunch of stuff in their terms.” He open sourced the terms. You can search for SparkToro investment terms and they are just on the internet, so you can check them out. I will say with TinySeed, one difference is we don’t have a 1X hurdle. They basically put a 1X hurdle in, meaning before they could take substantial dividends, they had to pay all investors back and then dividends start. We did away with that. Honestly, it felt very pro-investor, which was great when I was investing. But as TinySeed, I think it was just a little too generous for investors. All that said, Elnar Vollset, what are your thoughts on SparkToro making their model successful, kind of pioneering a new model and having this milestone?  Einar Vollset:Huge congrats to Rand and team. Obviously, Rand was very supportive of TinySeed early on and I’m eternally grateful. My view of it is I think it’s great for them. If I’m going to be critical, I feel like they’re probably underestimating their future desire to sell down the line. It’s probably optimized a little bit for dividends, which just because of the nature of SaaS companies and how they’re valued, it’s quite hard to basically an exit. Typically, once you get to a certain size past a couple million ARR, you’re typically selling on some kind of an ARR multiple. A typical free cashflow profit, something available for dividends, is obviously some subpercentage of the revenue. It’s not unusual for a pretty well-run, profitable, at-scale SaaS business to be doing 30-ish percent free cashflow that could be kicked out to dividends. Now, if you do the math on that, if that same business is growing well enough and is at a size, it probably is going to sell for at least five times ARR. If you do the math on that, that’s 15 years of dividends or a sale that returns the same amount of money probably with preferable tax treatment. That’s basically the reason why we didn’t adopt it immediately. That and also I think most founders, 80%, 90%, 95% probably, will not be in Rand’s and in Casey’s view of the world, and that they’re never going to sell. They’re going to run this forever and it’s just going to be a dividend machine. I think that’s probably the biggest, not objection exactly. It is more like a lifestyle choice. If that’s what they want to do, that’s fine. Their investors want to back him in that way, that’s also obviously totally fine. I think purely from maximizing return, there are probably different ways to do it, if nothing else, in terms of tax treatment and time value of money.  Rob Walling:Tracy, any thoughts from you?  Tracy Osborn:Rand’s blog post is super fascinating to read, because not only it goes into the thoughts around dividend model, but also the story of SparkToro and the lessons they learned. I thought it was interesting. Well, I am obviously a huge fan of this model, being that I work at here at TinySeed. There were some nuggets in there where it was good to note the influence that Rand had, but I’m happy that he was able to use his influence to create this new model, and inspire folks like us here at TinySeed. But his influence also made it more likely to be successful, because comparing his journey to TinySeed companies, they started SparkToro in March 2018. They closed their round in June, so that’s only a few months between launching a company and then closing a round. That’s probably built on the fact that people know Rand and how awesome he is, having that amazing network. If someone else is looking into doing the semi-bootstrap model, that’s probably not something that’s going to work for them, unless they already have that network that Rand had. Then they were able to work on SparkToro for about two years before launching. That’s one of those things that brought out to me a difference between how SparkToro does it with their terms, and the reason why TinySeed exists with our education. This is not meant to be an advertisement, but I was noting this is why we have the accelerator side of things. Because otherwise, someone trying to go through this semi-bootstrap model, wouldn’t be able to raise that amount of money immediately. Then be able to work on their company for a couple of years. Then start moving into being profitable and dividends and whatnot, after launching after two years, without having that existing network. I wanted to bring that out. That was a huge advantage to Rand, and one of the reasons why I think a lot of companies or a lot of folks who want to go through that semi-bootstrap route, needs to go through an accelerator.  Rob Walling:That’s knowing your unfair advantages. I often talk about the three unfair advantages when starting a SaaS company. One is being early. Second is having an amazing network. Third is having an audience, usually an engaged audience. Rand definitely has an incredible network and an audience. Doesn’t he have half a million X followers?  Tracy Osborn:Yeah.  Rob Walling:It’s X.com. Anyways, he knew that and he leaned into it, but for those who don’t, you can’t just make that appear out of thin air. He was leaning into his advantages.  Tracy Osborn:One more thing I thought that was really interesting from the blog post was that when they reached profitability, instead of starting doing their payback, they invested $1.2 million in a US treasury bond, with the intent of earning a little interest while they built up a cash cushion. Then let’s see, six months later they got that cash cushion with that continued profitability and the treasury bond payback, and then they were able to start doing that payback to the investors. I thought that was really interesting. I haven’t heard that from other profitable companies as an option for building up that cash cushion. I’m going to throw that question out there. What do you two think about that? Is that an option that people should look at if they’re profitable?  Rob Walling:It really depends. I think Rand and Casey were being pretty conservative with their money. They had the money to pay investors back, but if they wrote the checks, suddenly they have no cash in the bank. What if? You don’t know what’s going to happen. Is there another pandemic that happens and things go sideways? In fact, SparkToro is heavily based or was heavily based on the Twitter API. In fact, he talks about it in the blog post. I know obviously a little more as an investor, but they ran into a lot of platform issues there, and had to rewrite a bunch of it and stand still for a while. It didn’t do their growth any favors to have to do that. Was it the correct choice for them? Probably, because there was risk. I think if you’re being less conservative or if there isn’t a ton of risk, then the moment you have the money in the bank you can pull it out, so to speak, as long as you have enough breathing room.  Tracy Osborn:Overall, I feel like it’s a really good example of what I want to call the dream. The kind of company that people want to build where they keep control, but they do bring in just enough money so they can get over those initial hurdles, so that they become profitable. Then they can both be profitable in a reasonable period of time, but also have more control over their future. At the very least, I’m happy to hear more stories like this come to light, so folks know that os an option for them other than the black and white bootstrap only or full VC route only.  Einar Vollset:I think that’s true. That’s my view of it too. It highlights the fact that there are different ways of doing it than just raising money every 18 months and IPO or bust, which obviously, we’re huge believers in. I think it just showcases that you get to a certain size, which isn’t maybe as big as people think and you’re profitable, the world’s your oyster, you have options basically.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Even within bootstrapping, SparkToro is still mostly bootstrapped. It’s not like there is millions of venture, they’re not on the venture track and yet they raised a small amount of funding. That you can still keep incredible control over your own destiny and still raise this small amount. With that, we’ll move on to our next story. We’ll see if we get to the next two. They’re both about funding. The next one, I don’t want to rag on the person who wrote it, but this was published in the last couple of weeks and it’s called [inaudible].  Einar Vollset:Rag on them, Rob.  Rob Walling:Don’t take VC funding. It will destroy your company. Then proceeds to say, “VC funding is not a success, it’s a failure. VC funding means you will sell your company. Second order effects because your goal is to sell your company later, it has to grow. You’ll be spending much of your time finding the next investors. You have to focus on large markets with many or large customers. Profitability takes a backseat and this kills your company.” There are other ways to do it without raising venture. I agree with everything he says, but I’m like, “No (censored). Basecamp started talking about this 20 (censored) years ago. I started talking about this 18 years.” You know what I mean? I just don’t get, and this was at the top of Hacker News when I found it. It’s like this is not a new take and this is actually what bothers me a little bit. Maybe is it the internet or is it like the startup sphere?  Tracy Osborn:It’s just a rage bait thing.  Rob Walling:I will say things, I’ve said things in my book in 2010, and then every year or two, someone basically is like, “I just discovered this new thing. Oh my God, did you know you can bootstrap startups?” It’s like, “Where have you been? Do you not read anyone else’s stuff?” When I read this, I’m just like, “None of this is new. Is this new to anyone?” Is this new information to anyone, except for someone who’s not been on the internet their whole life and this is their first day on the internet? Am I being too angry about this, Elnar Vollset?  Einar Vollset:I think maybe you haven’t spent enough time on Twitter writing threads about bootstrapping and stuff.  Tracy Osborn:X.com.  Einar Vollset:That’s the main problem right here. Maybe it’ll be X rebrand. Finally, we’ll get the full Rob Walling experience. Yeah, I agree with this. I look at it, it’s like this is rage bait, reclick bait, whatever you want to call it. That’s fundamentally what it is to me. It is like, “How do you get people to talk about it, say on a podcast?” It’s like you make the most ridiculous, extreme views of your opinion. If you have the more balanced view, which is that, “You know what? Maybe in the last couple of years it’s been such that VC funding has been a little overblown and there is this other way. It gives you the opportunities and both have.” Just because I’m obviously pro-tenancy, it doesn’t mean that I think there aren’t situations where definitely you need to raise a bunch of money to do things. I don’t know, building rockets to go to Mars needs a bunch of capital. You’re not going to bootstrap a rocket company. That’s just not going to happen. I feel like a balanced article like this, just would never get picked up because it’s sort of obvious, that’s what I think.  Rob Walling:Tracy, anything to add?  Tracy Osborn:My notes for this when I was researching this, you already went through most of them where I’m just like, “Need citation, need citation, is a straw man. Not true, not true.” There was a quote. I think this goes really well with the story about Rand, in that we need to have more stories of people taking a middle route. Because the middle route is not obviously a path that people can take because all the stories in the past in the last 10 years, have been bootstrapped or VC. Then people are like, “You can’t do all VC.” It’s like but there’s this middle option. We need to have more success stories showing company that took just enough money, so they can get over those hurdles so that all the things that this article says are negatives, then they can navigate those hurdles by not going the full VC route. The article also has things, whereas is like every company can be bootstrapped, which is very not true. It has this anecdote about starting a medical software company, and then starting a one-person consultancy. Then you’ll learn about the problems and then maybe you hire, and then maybe you do this. It’s like this process would actually take years, years. Bootstrapping something for years is not possible for the average person, which is why this middle path needs to exist. You can take that multi-year process of finding product market fit. Getting the point where you understand the questions and you understand what you need to solve, and then you can start doing the hiring and get yourself to that level where you have that flywheel running. Take just enough money so that you can turn that multi-year process to hopefully a much shorter period of time by being able to throw money into it. They go hand in hand. It’s like this guy needs to, I think, take his rage against VC routes, and instead take his passion for startups and start advocating in this article, I think, to show people what they can do instead or what they can do to solve both those problems.  Rob Walling:I don’t read that he has rage and I don’t actually disagree with him, that’s the problem but it’s like, “But say something new.” I can go find basically what he said here in 20 other places, including Rand’s book, Lost and Founder. Including probably just going to ChatGPT and asking, including going to Google. There’s dozens of essays that basically said this and probably said it better. That’s where I’m like, “You have this feeling, that’s cool. Say something new.”  Tracy Osborn:Yeah. But he also got top of Hacker News, so it’s working.  Einar Vollset:Top of Hacker News, that’s the win. I think one of the interesting things, which we’re starting to see, is that I think a lot of companies will be forced into this realization because the funding drained up. I think a lot of companies that probably would never have been able to raise anywhere near the money that they did in ’20. Well, ’20 and ’21, they raised a crap ton of money and now they’re like, “We’re nowhere near the now much bigger hurdle for the round that we need next.” They basically have a choice. They have a choice, do they stay on the VC track and try to run of the world as fast as possible and hopefully figure it out? Or are they going to divert more towards this middle ground? I think obviously, there’ll be some successes that the people who run off the wall or run off the cliff or however you want to call it. But I think that in terms of success for founders, I think a lot more of those successes will come from the companies that are able to steer in a more sustainable path, get the breakeven at best, something like that, or maybe with a small bridge-through.  Rob Walling:For now until the cycle happens again. The cycle happened in the late ’90s with internet companies. It happened in 2005 to ’07 when money was cheap. It happened again in the late teens and we see it and so it’ll come back and everything old will be new again. We’ll hear people saying, “This is never going to stop.” Then we’ll say, “I’ve been through this a few times.”  Tracy Osborn:This is what it’s like aging, isn’t it?  Rob Walling:It is, you start seeing the same cycles over and over.  Tracy Osborn:Yep.  Rob Walling:Last story of the day really just piggybacks on this one. It’s from Fly.io and if you’re not familiar with them, their H1 is deploy app servers close to your users, run your full-stack apps and databases all over the world, no ops required. They’re essentially, they’re similar to a DigitalOcean or maybe like an Amazon EC2 type thing. I know they’re different, but it gives you an idea their infrastructure as a service. They released a blog post that is titled, “We Raised a Bunch of Money,” which actually appreciated the title. “This past July, we raised $25 million from a16z and our existing investors, including Intel Capital and Dell. Recently, we raised an additional $70 million led by EQT Ventures.” Then they go through to say, “Here’s why we did this.” Number one, a hardware fleet. Fly.io has always run on its own hardware. There are fun, technical control and destiny reasons to rack hardware. Number two, to hit all the regions. Number three, support and reliability. Then they talk about what’s not changing because funding cuts both ways. Now when people see you raise funding, they’re like, “Is it going to ruin the company?” I really brought this up. It was coincidental, this was also at the top of Hacker News. I don’t know if it was the same day or a few days later, but this to me is an example of probably a pretty good time to raise money. I remember talking to Dharma Shaw, co-founder of HubSpot, back in at Business Software in like 2008 or ’09. He and I had been the bootstrapper blogger types and they raised a bunch of money for HubSpot. I remember saying, “Why did you decide?” He wasn’t like super pro-bootstrapper but he was just a very sensible entrepreneur, who was building a real product for real customers to pay him real money. Not on that weird venture, we got a raise from day one and billion dollars and blah, blah blah, even though that’s what they eventually grew to become because they have IPO’d since then. But I remember him telling me, “Yeah, we would totally bootstrap, but at a certain point if you can put a dollar in the machine and take $3 out on the other side, don’t I want to raise like 20 million, 50 million of those dollars to put in the machine to make it grow faster?” It was a great, again, I’m three, four years into really owning software products at the time and I was like, “Ah, there really is a time when it’s probably even if you’re not building Facebook or you’re not building things that really are money intensive, where it probably does make sense to take on outside capital.” That was why in my first book, Start Small, Stay Small, I published in 2010. Within the first chapter I say, “I’m not anti-VC, I’m just anti the narrative that everybody all the time needs to raise it to start any tech company because that’s not correct.” That’s been my mission in life for the past 18 years since then is just saying there are multiple paths. But I do think there are companies that if I were to start them, I have a few ideas. I’m never going to start a SaaS company again, by the way, for the record. But if hypothetically, I were to do it thought experiment wise, I would go after a really big market. I would find a Haiti competitor in a massive space, and I would raise money right from the start. Not because I can’t do it as a bootstrapper, because I want to move fast. I want the resources, I know the value that it can provide.  Tracy Osborn:You have the network like Rand.  Rob Walling:Have the network, have the audience. Yeah. Tracy, any other thoughts on this Fly.io piece?  Tracy Osborn:Did you know we used Fly.io for TinySeed applications?  Rob Walling:No, I did not.  Tracy Osborn:Yeah, that’s where we’re hosted. I thought that was so funny we were talking about this. Yeah, that’s where I deployed the application.  Rob Walling:That’s cool.  Tracy Osborn:I am a fan. I needed something that was broke with different [inaudible].  Einar Vollset:Are they sponsors?  Rob Walling:They should be.  Tracy Osborn:They’re not sponsors.  Rob Walling:There’s several tiny companies that use them.  Tracy Osborn:We’re paying them money and they don’t know that we’re using them. Now they know that we’re using them for operations.  Rob Walling:But they raised money, Tracy. We need to get off and go to a hosting company that didn’t raise money.  Tracy Osborn:That goes into the note. I had that note in, well, that note in my notes where compared to the other guy that saying that, “Just start a medical consultancy company and start from scratch, and start really small.” This is a great example of something that could not start small, because they needed the capital so they can have these to support all regions. Imagine if they only had one region available for people to deploy to, that wouldn’t be tenable for most folks. Literally, this is a great example of a company that needs to have the investment so they can fulfill the promise that they have for their users of having this quick, easy deployment, that’s really fast and snappy. Yeah, it’s a great example of a company where bootstrapping slowly would not work.  Rob Walling:Elnar, closing thoughts on this piece?  Einar Vollset:Yeah. I’ve always been the opinion that capital’s a tool, and that’s partly why we started TinySeed in part. Because some of the early accelerator stuff were all optimized for this IPO or bus type scenario. Not everybody has wealth enough to not take a salary for a year or two while they figure it out. It made total sense to offer something like TinySeed, that was a hole in the market. That’s what capital is there to do. We also see with TinySeed companies, once they get to a certain size and it relates to everybody sells. It’s like once you get to a certain state, there’s certain things you may or may not want to do, and certain things that you want to go after. We see TinySeed companies, once they get to a million or two or three or four, take in private equity type growth round funding to get to the next step to build out the stuff that they want to do. I’m not for or against really anything, it’s just is it the appropriate tool? I think for Fly.io, it definitely is. I think for a lot of companies it can be at different stages. Just make sure you take the right kind of money basically.  Rob Walling:You know what you’re getting into.  Einar Vollset:Yeah. Don’t take money at the highest possible valuation you possibly can, just because that’s the highest possible valuation, unless you then really want to be on the IPO train or bust. Make sure that you understand what you’re doing when you’re taking capital.  Rob Walling:Yeah. I had a tweet I spit out a few months ago and then it’s actually a quote from my book, The SaaS Playbook, where I say being anti-funding is like being anti-hammer. Hammer is just a tool and it’s right sometimes and it’s not other times. These extreme views, while they get the clicks and they get to the top of the Hacker News, it’s irresponsible. It’s just dumb. Anytime I see someone say always and never in all caps, I’m like, “You are way too sure of yourself because it pretty much never applies.” I say that in all caps. Elnar Vollset, thanks so much for joining me today on this Hot Take Tuesday.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:You are Elnar Vollset on X.com. We’re never going to not nose left, nose short.  Tracy Osborn:It sounds not safe for work, which is probably what Elon loves about it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s interesting.  Tracy Osborn:Actually, they took down the twitter.com/Xvideos, is now a suspended account. A lot of people are supposing it’s because Xvideos is going to be the new video platform for Twitter, which is also not safe for work as a website URL. Anyway, sorry I derailed that. Fun facts.  Rob Walling:Tracy Osborn, you are @tracymakes on Twitter.  Tracy Osborn:And everywhere else.  Rob Walling:And Mastodon and Pinterest.  Einar Vollset:Bluesky.  Tracy Osborn:Wait, no. Is that true?  Rob Walling:Threads. No, you’re just everywhere. TinySeed applications open, well, it’s like six weeks from now, I believe.  Tracy Osborn:The beginning of September.  Rob Walling:Beginning of September.  Tracy Osborn:Right after Labor Day.  Rob Walling:For folks who are listening to this and are interested. I will be the first to say, if you don’t want funding, don’t raise funding. You know what I mean?  Einar Vollset:[inaudible].  Tracy Osborn:But if you want just enough funding, go find that.  Rob Walling:Right. If you want just enough funding with world-class mentorship and a cohort, and masterminds and all this stuff, then check us out, TinySeed.com. Let’s see, this is going to go live in, I don’t know, mid-August or something. Starting in September, each of us is going on the road for different reasons for TinySeed events and MicroConf. So we have several MicroConf locals if folks are interested, head to microconf.com. There’s an events tab at the top. We have MicroConf Europe in Lisbon, which is probably already sold out by the time this will air. But get on the wait list because tickets here and there do become available, as the venues sometimes open up a little more space, we could sell five or 10 more. Then, of course, MicroConf US in Atlanta next April, there are still some tickets available for that. Elnar and Tracy, thanks again for joining me and we’ll have you back on again in a few months.  Tracy Osborn:Woo-hoo.  Einar Vollset:Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Thanks to Elnar and Tracy for coming back on the show. Hope you enjoyed our takes on these news stories. We’ll be back with another Hot Take Tuesday here in a month or two. Thanks for listening this week and every week.

And with that, let’s dive into listener questions with Ruben. Back by popular demand, Ruben Gamez. People have been asking me on Twitter to have you back on the show. Thanks for taking time to hang out with me today.  Ruben Gamez:Thanks for the invites. It’s fun, always fun.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s going to be good, man. We got some really interesting questions that I want to tackle today. Our first question went to the top of the stack because Ben Daley sent in a video. He actually went to startupsfortherestofus.com. He clicked Ask a Question in the top nav. And then if you record audio or video, which you can do on your phone or on your computer, then that goes to the top of the stack. Maybe by the end of the episode, we’ll get to one or two text questions. I don’t know. We brought in an assistant producer and he looked at the Trello board and he said, “This one all the way on the left where the text questions are, is that where questions go to die?” And I was like, “That’s sad. That’s not what happens.” It takes us a little longer to get through them. So send audio or video, we’ll get there. But we will get to as many questions today as possible. So let’s hear Ben’s question about lifetime plans.  Ben Daley:Hey Rob, Ben Daley with auction.io here. Just got done listening to Ben Orenstein and Adam Wathan on Hackers Incorporated talk about lifetime value pricing model as opposed to monthly recurring revenue. Just wondering if you’ve listened to that episode and what your thoughts are on that idea. Thanks for all the great episodes. Really appreciate all that you have taught.  Rob Walling:Thanks for that question, Ben. So neither Ruben nor I had listened to that episode, but I’m glad you called it out. And I’m glad I also went and listened. I listened to about the first 15, 20 minutes of it. I skipped around a bit because there were some clarifications in there. When I first heard lifetime deals, I thought, “Oh, someone’s selling SaaS for a lifetime price? Don’t do that.” There’s maybe one or two exceptions, Ruben, because you have done apps CMO deals, but I think don’t do that. But it turns out that Adam was talking specifically about Tailwind UI, which he was calling a content business, and so that’s kind of changes I think the framing of the conversation. Realistically, to summarize for listeners who didn’t hear it, the title of the episode is Episode 4 of Hackers Incorporated and it says Lifetime pricing is underrated. And Adam Wathan, who’s the founder of Tailwind CSS, has a great business selling Tailwind UI components for the open source CSS framework. He was talking about how selling this for $29 a month or $30 a month or 39 or whatever wouldn’t make sense because people get a lot of value upfront and so they’ve switched, I believe, switched to lifetime pricing. I actually don’t know if they were ever not lifetime, but… So another on this lifetime pricing. And they were talking about the pros and cons, but a lot of the pros, especially for content businesses of using lifetime pricing. So as I kick it over to Ruben, I want to say for SaaS, for software where you’re running servers and providing an ongoing service each month, this is the worst idea ever. It’s the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. Do not do it. It ruins your exit multiples if nothing else, but it also doesn’t allow you to create business over time. You can lose 80, 90% of your revenue in one month if people just decide not to buy. That actually happened to me back in ’08, ’09 in the recession. I had a business doing several thousand a month then I lost 80 to 90% of the revenue in 30 days. And you can just imagine that’s the downside of not subscription. But with that said and with the framing of, “Hey, it’s this episode,” Ruben, you want to dig in a little on your thoughts?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I actually don’t have too much to say on this other than I agree with you on the SaaS part. If it’s software, SaaS or anything like that, then it’s not a good idea. Don’t do that. Even for the short term lifetime deals with apps like you said, I tell people to be very, very careful when considering those and be very deliberate. Know exactly what you’re doing. We thought of those as paid freemium basically.  Rob Walling:That’s what I was going to ask, was you were saying don’t do lifetime deals, but you have done multiple, so you thought of it as paid freemium, meaning the users essentially are free. You happen to get this one time payment. And you’ve been public about it. I mean I think one of the deals you took in 32,000 in cash, right?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. It was close to 40,000. I end up losing 40,000.  Rob Walling:40,000?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah.  Rob Walling:You’re bootstrapping. You get that one time influx, that’s great, but you thought of it as freemium, as paid freemium. Unpack that for us.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, because they’re basically free users after that one payment, right? And the payment isn’t for each individual user, it’s just not that much. So we did it for a lot of other reasons. It was just a combination of reasons of helping with getting a little bit of word of mouth going in the earliest days, getting a really nice… We have a horizontal products, so getting into a lot of different industries, helping with a little bit of our SEO efforts, which it actually did okay for us. It doesn’t always work that way in combination with a certain type of feedback. There were several things we were considering where it just made sense. And then for us, free users can be valuable if they’re using the product because we have a viral component and exposes other people to the… So if you have a product where that’s happening, that could maybe be an okay way to go. And the costs to support those is not very high, right? The only other thing that I’d mentioned besides it not liking it for SaaS is the whole lifetime value conversation that they we’re having. I get the logic, it’s like, “Well, if you know how much people are going to pay you in the lifetime, why don’t you just get that money upfront? It’s just math. Get that money from each of the people and you’re ahead because you have that money first and then that’s it.” I would say that lifetime value is not static, so that changes. So it’s just a snapshot. It’s also an average, right? And it doesn’t account for upgrades and just a lot of opportunity there that you can have to move that number. So I get the thinking, but especially with software, it’s going to move and you’re going to improve that as you improve churn and all that, so…  Rob Walling:Yeah. You make a really good point and I wonder if a lot of the people who would have paid you your most lifetime value… Let’s just say for the sake of argument that your average lifetime value at snapshot right now is $300. But some people, some businesses would pay you 400 or 500 600, 800, $1,000 over the course of many years and others would’ve paid you a couple months worth. What if the people that would’ve paid you a thousand dollars are the ones that would’ve paid you a lot are the ones that buy? I don’t know. You’re kind of losing out on the ability to earn that, I think, is the way I’m thinking about it.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, and identify those people, right?  Rob Walling:Right. Your best customers.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, your best customers. As you upsell them or offer additional features and services that they can take advantage of, it becomes really hard if you just treat everybody the same and everyone just gives you the same amount of money. You’re just trying to average everything.  Rob Walling:Yeah. But I do see Adam’s point about a business. I think that the issue that I have is the false dichotomy where he says, “It’s either going to do lifetime or I’m going to charge $29 a month.” He brings that up four or five times in the piece that I heard. That’s not what I would do. I would never charge $29 a month for Tailwind UI. I would either charge what he’s charging. What is it? 300 and 800 I think are the two tiers and right now it’s lifetime. I would either charge that annually. That’s what you pay every year to continue to get access to new stuff. Or I would go with the old model. This is a solved problem, right? This is a proven pricing model that Microsoft and Oracle used back when you and I were running dev teams 20 years ago where before SQL Server was a subscription, you would pay this one time fee for it. And actually, it was based on the number of processors it ran on. I don’t remember what the license was, but let’s say I paid $5,000 for a lifetime license to SQL Server to run the database. Then in order to continue to get bug fixes and to be able to email support or whatever, I had to pay, we, the company, had to pay 20% to 25% a year as maintenance. Why did that exist? Why did that 20% exist? Well, because they need to fund some developers and some people to answer the emails. There was ongoing maintenance with it. So when I think about Tailwind UI, I think if there’s any ongoing work, you don’t want a Ponzi scheme it and fund it from future customers. You want the customers who pay you today to fund that such that if suddenly you had zero customers next month… I know it won’t happen, but just follow me on, it’s a thought experiment. If you had zero customers next month, you have zero revenue, do you have to lay off all your developers and you can’t support it anymore? Does that work? I guess if everyone has it and it’s lifetime and they still have it and can use it, maybe they’re okay with it. But I guess are there any updates? Is there any support that needs to be done? In which I guess I’m coming back on the same thing of I would probably charge this same fee annually or I would charge this fee plus an optional annual maintenance. And if people don’t pay it, then they don’t get the bug fixes, they don’t get the new templates and they can’t email us for any type of help or support.  Ruben Gamez:I like that way of describing it. And you’re right, this is a problem that’s already been figured out way back. In the day with software. They did it one time. Just charging one time, nothing. Then they moved to, “Oh, there’s maintenance and stuff, let’s charge for that.” And you see this in other spaces like WordPress. Everyone used to be in WordPress just one time, that’s it. And then they figured out the same thing that was already figured out and they moved over to like, “Oh, let’s charge a yearly maintenance or whatever.”  Rob Walling:We talk about SaaS, and SaaS is and should be subscription because there’s all these costs and stuff associated with building and maintaining it. Are there products that should be sold one time? Absolutely. I’m holding up a copy of my book, The SaaS Playbook. I’m not charging you a subscription for buying this book because it’s information. I don’t have to maintain this. I don’t have to answer support emails. I don’t have to run servers. I don’t have to update it every year. In fact, if I do update it to a second edition, I’m going to sell it to you again. So I get it. I mean, that’s content business feasibly. But what’s interesting is there are also some SaaS apps that while they’re SaaS and it’s software that you’re using in your browser, the way the customers want to consume it is not be a subscription. It’s kind of a one-time problem they’re solving. And I’ll give you an example of that. We have a TinySeed company called Loadstar, Loadstar.app. It’s load testing. Their H1 is amazing. It’s, “Find your website’s breaking point before your customers do.” I love that H1. But what he has found is certain people, let’s say you work at an agency and you’re a web dev agency and you have all these client projects, you want a subscription because you’re testing sites every month to make sure they don’t break. But let’s say you and I are building our SaaS app and we deploy four times a year, we don’t need to test all the time. Subscription doesn’t make any sense, right? It’s a different consumption pattern. And that’s where you do look at alternate models like pay-as-you-go, right? And if you look at Loadstar, he has Loadstar fuel, which is where you buy these credits. They’re way more expensive than the subscription version, but you buy credits one time and then they just stay in your account and you consume them over time. MailChimp also has a pay-as-you-go. I know they got a lot of, because think about it, they were around in 2000 or something, 2002. People are really not used to subscriptions. And so they had that pay-as-you-go feature early on. I usually shy away from that. I would tend to hesitate to invest in a company, for example, that was all pay-as-you-go because SaaS is the best business model in the world and you don’t have all the advantages of SaaS going up into the ride and of the exit multiples and of all the things that come with SaaS. But it’s not to say that’s not still a viable business model. There’ve been businesses using that model for how long? For centuries? I mean, that’s just a normal company.  Ruben Gamez:Postmark does that too, though funny enough, they’ve been moving more and more. They might already have gotten rid of it. I’m not sure the pay-as-you-go part, trying to push everybody towards subscription.  Rob Walling:It’s just better. It makes their revenue not… I mean, I see 150 revenue graphs every month and we absolutely have a certain number of those, 5%, 10% that either have subscription plus pay-as-you-go or have subscription plus a percent of revenue process or a cut off the top or subscription plus you pay per email sent or whatever it is, right? And I see the graphs and those graphs are way spikier. And they spike way up to 50K and then they drop back down to 25K that month. Is that still a business? Yes. Is it as good as an MRR business that is just bringing in 40K every month and growing and up into the right? No, it’s not, right? And so that’s what you have to think about. So what I like about this whole conversation, and I appreciate Ben’s question, and the conversation between Adam and Ben on the podcast, is we can get a little too locked into this, “Everything’s $29 a month or $99 a month,” right? It’s monthly. Everything should be monthly. And I think everything shouldn’t be. I think monthly or annual are the best business models in the world, but there are times when you need to go back to first principles and say, “Is this really the ideal way to price this product?” So thanks for that question, Ben. I hope the answer was helpful and I appreciate you inciting me into some ranting. Ruben, maybe I’ll let you talk a little more on the next question. Sorry, I just had a lot of-  Ruben Gamez:No, that was good [inaudible].  Rob Walling:I’ve given a lot of thoughts to this, right? So I had a lot to say. All right, so with that, let’s roll into our next question. This one is from Luke about testing a market with a landing page.  Luke:Hey Rob and team, I have a question regarding market testing. My understanding of basic market testing is putting together a landing page and collecting interest about a new SaaS that way, whether it be email signups or even better account creations. However, my confusion is how to create a landing page for a product that doesn’t exist. Do we talk about features that are going to be available or do we talk about the features in terms of them already being available? Do we talk about features that are definite selling points but they won’t be available in the initial launch? How do we show off the design of the app when the app isn’t yet built? Super keen to hear your thoughts on this seeming chicken and egg problem. Thanks. Luke.  Rob Walling:I’ll give you first crack at this. Ruben, you want to give your thoughts?  Ruben Gamez:Sure, yeah. So yeah, I have a couple thoughts on this. First, a landing page, especially pre-launch doesn’t have to be very specific. You don’t have to have a lot of screenshots and figure it out all the features or anything like that, especially the first version of it. So I would say a landing page isn’t static, or don’t think of it as just being a static thing that you have your one pre-launch landing page and then that’s it. That’s what you’re going to roll with. The very earliest stage, you could just have something as simple as just basically a headline and with a hook, something that will get people interested in, then just a way for people to sign up and be notified. It could be that simple. And as you learn more and talk to more people and stuff, you can add more things that are going to help get signups. It depends on where you’re going to post the landing page. Some places you’re just not going to be able to. When it’s per year early, they want to… Let’s say product hunt. Once you launch, they do have a place for you to do that pre-launch as well. The other thing that I would mention is that initially in the first part of the question was about testing, market testing with a landing page. So I think that’s a really important thing to not confuse it, not think of it as like, “I validated the market because I have this landing page and people signed up.” It’s just one data point. It could be a good signal, but you don’t know if they’ll buy. Anyone that’s done this before, we’ve all had landing pages to where we get people to sign up. And then a lot of those people don’t actually pay. Plus you learn as you’re building out the product and it changes a little bit and all that. So yeah, you still want to talk to people, have good conversations that will… Get other data points other than just the landing page.  Rob Walling:The term landing page smoke test became popular around, it was in the late 2000s. Tim Ferriss had it in The 4-Hour Workweek. I had it in Start Small, Stay Small. I believe Eric Reese had it in The Lean Startup. Back then the description is more similar to what Luke’s talking about, where it was like your landing page acted like the product already existed and you literally had a sign-up button that when people would sign up, you’d then say, “Oh, we’re almost ready to launch,” or “We’re in beta. We’re in early access. Give us your email and we’ll notify,” right? I was little bit and switchy, but you were trying to truly test how many people would actually click through and try to sign up. And maybe you even had a signup form, that way they put an email and a password and this and that. You could take it to a certain extent, right? I haven’t seen that done in forever.  Ruben Gamez:No. And even that, what you’re really testing is you’re testing your ability to acquire customers through a specific channel if you’re testing that through [inaudible]. It still is not a real validation of whether you have something that’s a product that you want to continue, right?  Rob Walling:Yeah. So if you today, Ruben, were working on your next product, would you do the smoke test that I just described? Or would you put a landing page like, “Here’s what we’re building. This is the value prop. This is the thing that this is going to fix”? And I would almost think of it if I were going to do it because I would want to go into a big market, I would think, “How do I position myself against the existing thing?” So I’d be like, “If you need a great CRM but hate Salesforce, we are revolutionizing blah, blah, blah.” If you think about even the last one of these that I did, this landing page opt-in thing was for TinySeed. And if you go back to that landing page, it was like, “Venture capital is broken for bootstrappers, it doesn’t work. And here’s why we’re going to fix it.” So I was positioning us as the not VC. If you think about Drip, it was the not whatever, Eloqua, Pardot, Infusionsoft or whatever. I didn’t actually know that when we did the landing page. So the landing page itself didn’t have that, but pretty quickly the homepage did. So with all that said, that’s how I would think about it. How would you proceed when we put up a landing page to gauge interest in this and that, how would you do it?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, it would be not trying to test the specific channel and method of acquiring customers. It would just literally almost be trying to test the hook. You’re trying to get and see if that works for people. And it really depends also who are you putting that in front of? Even for the purposes of just getting the domain out there in a page going and having it start to be indexed, if you’re going to be doing any sort of content marketing, you want to have a little bit of age behind that. So yeah, I would think of in that way. And maybe I can get to a point of where we’re getting close to further along with the product and then we have a landing page that speaks about the features a little bit more and I want to run a test and see like, “I think I can acquire customers through Google Ads or Facebook or some other thing that we’re testing.” In that case, I’d know what I’m testing for basically. Know what the goal is and then have your landing page dedicated for that.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I could see that. Back in the day, 15, 18 years ago, whatever, I did run this smoke test thing that he’s talking about, I believe, for two software products, neither of which I ever built, and then for a handful of info products where I was actually doing what you’re saying, where I was using Google AdWords or Facebook ads or something driving, saying, “This is the book that I’m going to write about becoming a developer,” or whatever it was. It was this term. And I was trying to see if people… There was a buy now button and then if they click through, then I was testing stuff. I think I did wind up writing one of those. It’s an ebook about becoming a developer and it never did much. But since then I just stopped and I do it now more. Like you said, everything I’ve done since then, you think about, I’ve used landing pages to launch/get an early access list for a conference, MicroConf, for multiple books now. Start Small, Stay Small, and SaaS Playbook, for Startup accelerator, TinySeed, for SaaS product, Drip. You know what I mean? It’s like I’ve done it for a lot of different stuff and all of those have been what we’re describing here, which is what’s the pain I’m trying to solve? How am I going to position that? There’s a question Luke has about screenshots and this and that, and as you’re saying, it’s like, “You don’t need that yet.”  Ruben Gamez:No. Early on you don’t need that. I did that with SignWell as well. It was Docsketch at the time. Way back in the day, I did that with Bidsketch. I’ve done that with a couple product ideas that I’ve had and then put up a page and then after talking to people realized, “Eh, I’m not going to do this.” So I didn’t waste the time to try and create this page that looks like a homepage with all these screenshots and features and try to go, because there are things that you just need to figure out first before you even get to that point.  Rob Walling:And what you’ll know is that if you put this landing page up, the best part of getting people to opt in is not to say, “Oh, I have 100 email addresses.” It’s to say, “I’m going to email every one of these 100 people and I’m going to try to talk to them.” I mean, I would do a lot of it via email where I’d reach out and be like, “Hey, wondering why you opted in. Is it because you listen to podcasts and you’re just curious? Is it because this is a problem you have?” And then usually I would go back and forth via email because that’s my mode of choice. Every once in a while I’d get on a call. These days I tell people, “Get on a call. It’s just higher fidelity.” Now with jobs to be done… Again, 15 years ago, I don’t even know if it existed. I’d never heard that term. But these days it would be more about that, of like, try to get people on a Zoom call or some type of… Have them record a Loom, have questions. There’s a way, it’s a learning.  Ruben Gamez:Get better feedback, yeah. One thing that I did with SignWell was on the landing page, when they opted in, the next page was a survey. So it didn’t do a confirmation page. It didn’t say, “We’ll notify you” or whatever. It went to the survey and it just asked their name, the things that I wanted to know, why were they interested, how many documents a month did they send and all this stuff. And then after that, then it would be like, “Here’s your success page.” It cut down a little bit on the number of people that completed. But even after the first step, if they didn’t finish the survey, they got an email saying, “Hey, you’ve been notified. Here’s the survey.” Still prompting them again to try and get them to submit it. So getting some data when they’re the most engaged.  Rob Walling:That’s super smart. I like that approach. So thanks for the question, Luke.

I wanted to ask you, what strategies would you use to market a URL shortener SaaS product? So just a little bit about T.LY, it’s a link management platform that allows you to track, brand, and share short URLs. And recently, I’ve been focusing my efforts on SEO and new features. I also have a link shortener browser extension that has close to 500,000 users and has been a great source of new customers. I’d love to hear your thoughts on where you would be focusing your marketing efforts if you were in my shoes. Thanks again for all your advice.  Rob Walling:What do you think, Ruben? These are always challenging because it’s specifically a URL shortener. It’s like, “They’re SEO for that?” But what do you think about how you would go about marketing this?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, so this is tricky. Whenever I see something like this, I’m tempted to go into HREFs and start to look into like, I am sure I can generate all sorts of ideas and things to do that are specific because it’s just fun.  Rob Walling:Right.  Ruben Gamez:So what I found interesting was that he said they have close to 500,000 users from a Chrome extension looks like. So just based off of that, the first thing that comes to mind is just do more of what’s working, right? That’s worked. So I’m just thinking does engineering has marketing work? Is there opportunities for other Chrome extensions that are… So this is very broad and this is just a link shortener, but maybe specific to use cases that you’ve identified. Or are there other extensions for the other browsers if you don’t already have them? Stuff like that. So really it’s starting with that. I’ll try to generalize the thinking just so that’s useful for other people that have different types of products. The other thing would be this is a very horizontal sounding product in that it’s not specific to a niche, designers or whatever, marketers, but you probably have use cases that you’ve identified as being the most valuable. I would start… And I do this through all throughout from the early days. We’re talking about marketing, but you want to start to identify the most valuable use cases, the things that people will pay for, and then start to think about how you can market specifically for that. And don’t worry about the big numbers so much, like, good, yes, get the big numbers, get everybody in. That’s what we did with SignWell. But then once you start to have all this data, which is great, look at the data, look at those bright spots and identify like, “Oh, okay. This use case for marketers is super interesting. If we just focus on this, what can we do on the marketing side? Yes, the numbers are going to be smaller, but it doesn’t matter because these are more valuable. They’re going to pay us,” all this stuff. So I’d really start breaking it down in that sort of way, especially with something that’s a little bit more horizontal like this  Rob Walling:Super smart. Now all the listeners know why you’re where I steal most of my good ideas because you… Well, because if you think it through, it’s sounds very logical coming out of your mouth, but it’s like, “Oh yeah, no, that’s exactly what you should do. That’s a really good idea.” The other thing that I thought about was similar but different from a different angle is like, “Well, if you have a Chrome extension and it works, does Firefox have extensions and Safari? And what are all the other browsers that have extensions?” I don’t know. I would’ve to go look at it. I’d have to figure out how to then do the… What is their app store SEO or their extension store SEO because that’s the big thing, is you got to have to rank for it and you need the reviews and whatever else they factor in. But similar sentiment of double down on what’s working, just do… You were saying, more chrome extensions, which is perfectly viable and also more extensions in other browsers going both directions. The other thing I was thinking about was obviously you could get into HREFs and come up with SEO ideas and I think that that probably be an entire podcast on its own. But I’m wondering, we do see Bitly and these other URL shorteners, how did they get big? I would at least want to know. I would go look at podcast interviews with any of those founders or whatever information I could try to figure out. I was like, “What are they doing?” And I can go into, again, HREFs or Semrush or whatever, and, “Look, are they doing SEO or not? Are they running paid ads?” You can go to the, it used to be SpyFu, but their services now are, right? We can look at if they’re running paid ads. I’m guessing Bitly is not running ads to acquire their customers, but what’s their free thing? Is it extensions and you’re already doing that? Then can you double down on that? That’s kind of what I would think. And I’m not saying copy your competitor, but this is a bit of a product type that’s been around for what? 15 years now? And so, there are certain-  Ruben Gamez:The answers are there already, yeah.  Rob Walling:Yeah, and then it’s just do those better. That’s what I would be trying to do, right?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. I use this a lot and I tell people to do this a lot when they’re in a category that’s established already. Things have already been figured out how people buy, why they buy. Not just that, but what to sell. On the surface it seems like, “Oh, okay, I go to their pricing page and then of alternate like Bitly or whatever, and then I see what they’re selling and it gives me an idea.” But you want to go deeper than that because there’s probably enterprise there. What does that look like? Talk to salespeople. Really dig in and understand how the market works. And then you start to build a picture of like, “Oh, these alternatives kind of go in this direction and this is how they make their money and this is how much they’re making.” Get a really full picture of how all of that works, so it helps you design your own offering and figure out an approach that’s going to work for you.  Rob Walling:I agree. And I’ve always done this with, I’ll grab a notebook or some type of Google Sheet or whatever and it’s like I want every competitor around me that’s viable and I want to know not only their listed pricing, but exactly what you said. It’s like you know there’s unlisted pricing when someone comes in and says, “I want to shorten 100,000 links a month via an API for my…” I don’t know what business, but there’s some businesses that needs to do, I guarantee it. And so what do they do? Well, they talk to enterprise. And how do they price that? I don’t know. Let’s figure it out. Let’s do some research. Let’s pose as a customer potentially. There’s a bunch of different ways that you can think about. Once you get your head around that, you start to see where the money’s at.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. And who are their best customers? And then we did this, and then talk to those people and see what they want. It’s not enough to just say, “Oh, these are the best customers. We can go in this direction. Know what you’re getting yourself into. We looked at real estate and it’s like, “Okay, this is big obviously for a lot of e-sign companies.” We talked to a lot of them, interviewed them, and then found out, “Oh, there’s a lot more to build out for this. And then they have these things that we don’t like so much for starting point, let’s not do that.”  Rob Walling:I like what you said there of… What you really said is… Because realistically, Tim was kind of saying, “How do I get more people in the funnel?” And the first thing you said is, “Maybe you don’t want more people, you just want more of the right people. Even if it’s fewer, you want the ones that are going to pay you a lot of money,” right? The best customers. And best is maybe realtors are not it if they need all these special requirements. So they may pay you money, but they’re not the best because of X, Y, and Z. So that’s the thinking that it shows that you’ve been a successful entrepreneur for what? 14 years now, is that you’re thinking at that next level of how do we get this done in a way that’s not just widening the funnel. So thanks for the question, Tim. Hope that was helpful. Our next question is from Pedro about really it’s about building copycat apps. He’s tried the stair step approach, looking at Shopify apps and wondering, “Is there something to be done here with just copying existing apps?”  Pedro:My name is Pedro, I’m from Ukraine, currently living in Poland because of war. I found your video on YouTube about stair and step approach and decided to follow it this year. Few years ago, I built a Shopify app, but it failed mostly because there was no much need in product. However, I was able to make $1,000 in 10 months, but I shut it down because I thought it’s a waste of my time. I didn’t have original ideas. Currently, I’m building something that already exists. I would say it’s copycat of another app, but with more features and some ideas. I want to build multiple apps like that and to make 5 to 10 [inaudible] to quit my job. So my question is, what do you think about copycats in general? What do you think about this kind of approach to build something that already exists, add more features, try to come with some ideas maybe? Because I know for marketplaces like Shopify and others, it’s pretty common to see some apps like that. Thanks for your podcast.  Rob Walling:What did you think about this one?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, this is a fun topic because I know it makes a lot of people unhappy when they’re thinking about copycats and all this stuff. And of course it’s super annoying, yes. If I put something out, I see somebody copying my stuff, and there are different ways of copying it, then I’m not the happiest person of course. But you kind of learn to ignore it, that’s when you know to expect it. Once you’ve been out there, it’s going to happen. There’s a really underrated MicroConf talk from back in the day that I like a lot from Heaton about… It was pirates and explorers. He talks about this whole whole thing about there are different types of founders. Some are pirates and some of them are explorers. Explorers sort of innovate and all that, and that’s where their strengths lie. And then pirates tend to be fast followers that kind of copy features and they understand their strengths. Once you understand that… And the context was a little bit different and it was more speaking about competitors and how to think of it and understand what’s going on there, but I like that framing because I think it is important to understand where your strengths lie. And if it’s on the innovation and you’re trying to work against that and try to take a strategy to where you’re just copying apps and all that stuff, then it’s maybe not the best approach for you. But if it is, then understand where your strengths lie. Speed is a big part of it. And then it’s not just like… When you say copying, that could mean a lot of things, right? It’s about always trying to improve. And maybe you’re not that good of a product person. So it’s where you’re not going to be improving the product that much. But if you’re not going to be doing that, then you better be good. You better be better at other things like distribution. You better be better at-  Rob Walling:Marketing.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, at sales or whatever because it’s going to be really hard to make that work as a business if you’re not better somewhere.  Rob Walling:My two things, I’m in line with you. My two thoughts around “copying.” Now here, I have personally, since I am a product person and I tend to get really annoyed, my products have been copied and it’s super annoying to me, so I will not tell you and I cannot tell you, “Oh, go just do a carbon copy of someone else’s stuff” because that’s (beep) to me. Now, it’s capitalism. And so some other people may have a different opinion on that, of like, “Well, you can’t trademark or copyright your user interface and the features you have, so legally I can do that.” Me personally, it pisses me off so much because I’m a builder. But all that aside, if you just build the same thing, you have no advantage. That’s exactly what you said. You have to either build the product better in a way that is noticeable. You need a differentiator. Or you need to be way better at marketing or sales. And if you’re building Shopify apps, what does that mean? To me, that means I can build mostly a similar product to what exists. But if I outrank you in the app store, I’m probably going to pick up some customers. If I get to number one for this term, it’s just an SEO play, right? Or what do you call it? ASO, app store optimization when you’re trying to actually rank in an app store, but it’s basically just search engine optimization. I’ve absolutely seen folks build Shopify apps that weren’t differentiated, but they ranked high and so they got decent traction. Or I’ve seen folks build something that ranked the same, but it had this one key differentiator. It could hit an API and pull in a bunch of stuff that the other ones couldn’t. And so anyone who needed that had to go there, right? They had positioned themselves for this specific use case almost. That’s always how I feel about it. Because I don’t know, man. If you build the same product and you’re selling it the same way and you’re kind of not as you’re the innovator like them, exactly to your point, it’s like why would anyone use you?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, I think there might be a situation to where you can build something and have something almost the same to where you can get customers and be in an okay position. That might be if you’re entering into space where people really are upset and not happy with the existing solutions for whatever reason, right? It might be like, “Oh, support’s bad and it’s bugging.” In that case, it’s like if you just kind of have the same thing but support’s good and it works, then people will be happy. It’s still different, right? There’s still a difference there. But it doesn’t have to be in the feature direction so much if there are other opportunities elsewhere.  Rob Walling:Yeah. It’s any type of advantage. Or it’s either an advantage you have or a weakness they have that you’re exploiting is really what it comes down to. So thanks for that question, Pedro. I hope that was helpful. Our first text question of the day is from Callum and they ask, “Hi, Rob. I’ve really enjoyed listening to your podcast. I’ve just started listening this year, but they’re inspiring and empowering for me in my attempts to become a startup founder one day. I’m a software engineer with around four years of industry experience. I’m working on my own early stage business outside of my job. My day job is as a software engineer at a medium-sized tech company, but I’m being forced to find a new one. I want to take this opportunity to make the right step to maximize my learning and my chances of building a successful bootstrap startup one day.” “My question is, should I try to find a startup company where I can get more responsibility or should I try to get a job in a big tech company? I’m leaning towards working at a startup and sacrificing my potential salary increase. I have no other dependence other than myself. I would do this in favor of maximizing my learnings on how to run a successful business. On the other hand, I believe I could still learn a lot of engineering skills from a big tech company and build up more savings if I work for them since the salary’s larger, then that could help support me if I chose to go full-time on my startup at some point.” What do you think about this, Ruben?  Ruben Gamez:So I think a lot of it depends on the person and how they get energy, what their strengths are, all that stuff. Personally, I prefer to learn by doing and I’d want to just start doing the thing. There’s only so much you’re going to learn by having a job. Learn about doing your own business and having your own software product. Even if you’re working for a startup, it’s still not… There’s just so much that you’re not going to learn. That said, yes, you’ll learn more with the startup if that’s your goal. And if you just feel like that’s what you need to build the confidence or whatever, that’s cool. There’s nothing wrong with that. There are a couple ways of thinking about it. Sometimes startups can be more time-consuming. And if you’re thinking at some point, “I wanted to do this on the side, start my own thing on the side now,” and you might not have the ability to do that because you’re so tired, there’s not enough time in the day or whatever, and it might make sense to… Like, I had a bigger, boring corporate job and I did stuff on the side because it didn’t take all of my time like some startups can, and it left me with a lot of energy and time and kind of motivation to do my own thing. So yeah, I just think it’s largely personal, but yeah, you will learn more stuff in a startup that applies, but not as much as you think. You’re going to learn the most when you actually do the thing.  Rob Walling:And I think the reason he’s not just doing the thing full-time is money. He needs a salary to live on.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah. Yeah. And I just mean on the side, right?  Rob Walling:Ah.  Ruben Gamez:Nights and weekends or whatever. Some people have trouble with that, I get it. I didn’t. It was always a thing that I could do.  Rob Walling:That’s what I had to do.  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, right.  Rob Walling:“I didn’t have a problem because I couldn’t have her. If I had a problem with it, then I was not going to be an entrepreneur. It was my only option.” So I get it. I had a problem with it. I didn’t give a (beep) that I had a problem because I wanted to out own my own business, you know?  Ruben Gamez:Right.  Rob Walling:I get the feeling with you. That was a similar thing. So what you’re saying is you’re going to learn the most working on your own thing on the side, on nights and weekends, and you will learn some from the startup and less from the bigger one is basically that’s your sentiment?  Ruben Gamez:Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. But I think a big part of it is if you are going to be doing some stuff on nights and weekends, really, really consider… I say this because I’ve had friends that have made this mistake. They’ve taken like, “Yes, you do a startup job.” It’s fun, it’s exciting, [inaudible], it’s challenging and you still want to do something on the side, consider the environment that you’re going into and if it’s going to leave room for that.  Rob Walling:Yeah. This is similar to a question I answered in the last couple months where it was kind of deciding between a startup job that didn’t pay as much and a big company job where it was super political. And I think he was already at that job. He worked the day job and he was going to take a pay cut to go to a startup, and that was something I brought up was, A, it depends on you, your personality because as I said, working nights and weekends, I just ground through it. I could never grind through politics. That (beep) drove me nuts, absolutely that (beep) crazy. I couldn’t handle it. So that was just one of the things that I wouldn’t do myself. But I know some people who navigate it really well and they would put up with it. So I think we’re on the same page here. You’re going to learn more from the startup day job, than the big company day job for sure. But are they going to make you work 50, 60 hour weeks? Is that the culture there? And so then it would pull away from your nights and weekends. Yeah, it’s always a tough choice. I think I know what I’d be doing. I’d be doing nights and weekends, me personally, plus the startup as long as I could ensure that they weren’t going to grind me, grind me down to a nub. So thanks for that question, Callum. I hope it was helpful. Last question of the day. “How do we balance customer needs with our strategic roadmap?” This is from Nate, and he says, “Listening to Startups for the Rest of Us has been a part of my weekly routine for a couple years. You’ve been able to find topics that are always relevant for me on my startup journey. So thanks for the consistent support. I’m the CEO and co-founder of a bootstrapped identity business focused on the enterprise. We started as pure services and we saw big companies trying to solve the same problem with identity platforms over and over. So we’ve reinvested profits back into the business to build our SaaS product” Congratulations, because a tough switch to make. I see so many services companies try to do this and there’s a headwind to doing it. Back to Nate’s email. “Since we had developed trust and a great relationship with one of our customers who is a major global enterprise, we were able to sell them our first license. So we have a grand total of one customer using our product to date. Granted, it is enterprise, so the license is a few hundred thousand dollars, but that’s another conversation.” “My question is, as you can imagine, we are now balancing trying to build features based on our strategic roadmap and we’re trying to balance that with catering to what our one SaaS customer wants us to build. They make up almost 75% of our revenue, so we want to keep them happy, but we also need to diversify and get more customers. I’m constantly faced with whether I stick to my guns and forge ahead with this strategic roadmap at any cost to find product market fit or continue to try and balance our roadmap with building customer feature requests. These two have been very challenging. We only build features that are generic enough that anyone can use them and the problems that customer is trying to solve are great ones, but that doesn’t necessarily put us closer to product market fit. So what do you think is the better long-term strategy for the business?” Man, that’s a tough situation. What do you think?  Ruben Gamez:So it’s great that they have a customer that’s paying that much and they have other customers, I guess, that are also paying for the product because… Is that right? Because it says 75% of the revenue.  Rob Walling:Yeah, that’s what I was confused by. He said they have one customer but then said it’s 75% of the revenue, but maybe it’s 75% and the other 25% is services revenue.  Ruben Gamez:Services. Oh, okay. That could be [inaudible].  Rob Walling:Let’s assume that. Yeah, so they literally have zero other SaaS customers. Let’s assume that.  Ruben Gamez:Okay, so yeah, this is dangerous. It’s tricky because it’s kind of good, you’re like, “Oh, somebody will pay for this.” But then it’s the danger zone of you have this one customer and they may be dictating too much of your product development. And it’s good, I like that he mentions, “We’re building features that they want but are generic enough in a way to where it applies to other people that are going to want to use the product and it’s going to improve the price.” So it’s kind of killing two birds with one stone. But you’re right, he calls it out like, “This isn’t getting us closer to product market fit.” It’s just building these maybe retention features or something like that, that they’re kind of necessary, but not the ones that are going to get people to buy the product. So it sounds to me, and I may be wrong here, this is one of the things that I think is dangerous, that you may be trying to build something that’s maybe a little bit more self-serve. So you’re building out features that anyone can use and you’re doing it for a customer segment that you have zero customers for and you don’t know anything. So it’s like you’re not even working towards product market fit yet in that case. I would say first make a decision. And if you feel good about the type of customer that you have now at a few hundred thousand dollars, that’s truly enterprise. Go in that direction, get more of those. They’re going to take longer to get in, but if you can sell one, maybe you can sell another one or a couple more and build for that type of customer. Don’t mix them up, especially if you’re going to really keep this one customer on board and try to make them happy. With limited resources, it’s really, really, really tough to build out something for the lower than the market and also build out for enterprise. Decide and just do it that way.  Rob Walling:I don’t think I have anything to add to that. I think that was a really good summary of it. You’re obviously in a pickle having to make a hard decision, but your point about it doesn’t necessarily feel like you’re moving towards product market fit, because kind of guessing at what that is if you don’t have other customers that you’re building for, right? And if you do, let’s just, for sake of argument, assume they have three other prospects that are hot to trot and really want to use this product, but they can’t until you build X, Y, and Z. Well, then that kind of answers the question, doesn’t it? Like I would build X, Y, and Z and I would feasibly lose. Even if you lose your biggest customer, if their product market fit is different than the product market fit of the next three, that’s not SaaS, right? That’s consulting work. And that’s just a different… You’re building custom solutions for people. So that’s the hard part. I guess I want to say I know we’re all scared of losing a customer, and especially a customer is paying you hundreds of thousands of dollars funding this, and obviously you don’t want to lose it now in the near term when they’re funding development. But this first customer may not turn out to be a good long-term customer for you if product market fit is quite different than what you are building for them.  Ruben Gamez:Than the ideal customer. Yeah, that’s a really good point. That’s another dangerous thing about this. When you have a customer like that that’s just contributing so much of revenue, how representative are they of other customers that you’re going to get? And if not, you’re right, lose them. I mean, sometimes they can hurt and sometimes you can’t until you get some new customers in there and all that stuff figure it out. But yeah, don’t let them dictate too much of what you’re doing.  Rob Walling:So thanks for that question, Nate. I hope it was helpful. Ruben Gamez, you are @earthlingworks on Twitter, and @SignWellApp on Twitter, and of course, SignWell.com if folks want to use the best electronic signature platform on the internet. Thanks for joining me, man.  Ruben Gamez:Thanks. This was fun. Thank you.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it was a good time. I really enjoy these listener question episodes because they get me thinking outside of my own box, outside of my own head, right? I have mental models of how startups should be built and grow, and those have been refined over 15, 17 years of doing it and investing in all the companies and advising. But it’s so interesting to hear unique questions that I’ve just never thought of before, and that’s what these episodes allow me to do, and me with a guest sometimes as well. And so I really appreciate you sending them in. And I hope that these episodes are helpful not only for you if you’re asking a question, but even for those of you who listen to this show week in, week out, and whether you’ve listened for six weeks or six years. I hope that you can get insight into specific issues and struggles that other founders are experiencing, that I think is the real value of hearing from others in the community so that each of us doesn’t feel alone and isolated as we sit at our standing desk in our extra bedroom eight hours a day, not communicating with other founders. My hope is that this show and the listener questions that we get can be some semblance of connection for you, to the rest of this podcast and MicroConf family.

I’m your host, Rob Walling, and on this show, we talk about entrepreneurship and diving into bootstrapping and mostly bootstrapping. Sometimes we raise a little money. What we do know is that we seek freedom, purpose, and relationships, in relation to our companies and our products and the businesses that we build and put out into this world. Today, I talk with Jon Hainstock. Jon bootstrapped and exited ZoomShift. He’s currently building ChatterDocs.ai, and he’s an M\u0026A advisor, helping entrepreneurs exit well at Quiet Light Brokerage. I’ve known Jon for several years. He’s come to several MicroConfs, and you probably know him from Twitter. But if not, it’s a great story hearing how Jon bootstrapped his company and then, immediately after the sale, tried to dive right back in. He’s acquired a few things since then, but really has found joy in helping other people do that hard task of exiting, of deciding when to sell their company. And towards the end of the conversation, we talk about pitfalls to avoid when you are looking to acquire a company. And while we’re on the topic of exits, this is the first announcement of MicroConf’s Exit Event. This is an invitation only, premium all inclusive retreat for SaaS founders looking to sell their companies for eight or more figures. So that’s 10 million or more dollars. We’re in the early stages of planning a transcendent, an amazing experience. It’s going to be in partnership with Quiet Light Brokerage. It’s going to be co-hosted by myself and Dr. Sherry Walling. And we’re going to talk about all things selling SaaS. This event’s going to have super limited capacity, probably only have maybe 20 founders. It’s for high performing SaaS companies, that are growing quickly, and it’s going to be a mix of work and play. It’s called the Exit Event. You can head to microcomf.com/exit if you’re interested. This is one that’s going to sell out fast. So if this is something you’ve been thinking about, I would suggest head to microconf.com/exit. And with that, let’s dive into my conversation with Jon Hainstock. Jon Hainstock, welcome to Startups For the Rest of Us.  Jon Hainstock:Hello. Thanks for having me.  Rob Walling:Yeah, man, I feel like you’ve been around MicroConf for quite a while. I’ve seen you on Twitter. I’ve known each other for several years. I was thinking as we were chatting today that somehow you had been on the show before, but you haven’t. You just kind of been in the zeitgeist. So I’m really kind of happy to introduce you to the listeners. And so folks get an idea, you built and sold a SaaS company called ZoomShift. And do you want to give us just a brief kind of timeline of how that happened, when you started, and when you exited? And then, we can talk briefly about that decision around that.  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, absolutely. So ZoomShift was started by my business partner, Ben, and he had created it kind of as a portfolio project to kind of showcase his development skills. He was learning development essentially in programming, and he built that when he was in college. And he won this business competition at the Marquette School of Business. And we ended up partnering up together through an accelerator program. I was doing some marketing for that accelerator program, and we ended up joining forces when that whole thing kind of shut down.  Rob Walling:What year was that?  Jon Hainstock:I believe this would’ve been 2000 and… Let’s see here, 8, maybe. 2009.  Rob Walling:Oh, wow. So it was a long time ago.  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I’m trying to think of the exact timeline. I’m going to have to go back and think about that for a second. But yeah, it was a while ago.  Rob Walling:Yeah. Yeah, that’s crazy. And was it SaaS from the start? And to give people an idea, I probably should have said the H1 of ZoomShift is a work schedule maker designed for hourly employees, build your work schedule in minutes, track time off, reduce labor costs, and have confidence your team will show up on time. So back in, we’re talking, if it’s ’08, you’re talking 15 years ago, and whether it was 13 or 14 or 15, doesn’t really matter. It’s just that it was a long time ago. Was it SaaS from the start?  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, it was. So actually, I’m going to have to reverse back on this answer. So I think, when I think back to the timeline, I believe it was 2011 is when we first started building into what would become ZoomShift, so different timeline, for sure. Still a long time.  Rob Walling:Yeah, it’s still 12 years. Yeah. It’s a long time ago. So it was SaaS from the start, and you partner up with your co-founder. So did he come up with the idea then? He was already working on it?  Jon Hainstock:Yeah. And there was a couple incumbents in the space at that time. It was still very early. This is before things were really starting to take off. It was still very early. And he had built the prototype kind of based on some of the things that he was seeing happening in the competitive space. So it wasn’t this, “Hey, this is an original idea. There’s already some other solutions out there. Let’s try to create something similar and ride the wave.”  Rob Walling:As everything’s being SaaSified. We’re still in the golden age of SaaS, but it’s definitely more competitive today than it’s ever been. And so, when did you sell it?  Jon Hainstock:So that was in 2020 that we sold, was going right into COVID, which nobody had any idea what was going on at the time. ZoomShift serves retail, hospitality, or restaurants. So they took a pretty big hit during that period of time.  Rob Walling:Yeah.  Jon Hainstock:But we had sold right before all that happened, actually.  Rob Walling:Without any knowledge it was coming, right? None of us knew it was coming. That’s crazy. Okay, so can you give us an idea of maybe where the business was at when you sold?  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, so we were profitable. We were both working full-time on it. We had a full-time customer support person doing six figures in revenue, and things were really pretty stable overall. Churn was low, growth was slow, but steady.  Rob Walling:That’s cool. And why did you decide to sell?  Jon Hainstock:There were a number of reasons. I think the biggest reason for us was realizing we were kind of at a fork in the road, in terms of, if we wanted to take the business to the next level and to try to grow and maybe potentially exit to a private equity company or something along those lines, strategic in the future, it would really require a massive shift in how we were operating the business. We were operating primarily around profits, lifestyle, kind of on a saver’s mentality versus a growth mentality. We realized that, as the competition increased, we would have to put a lot of energy and resource into building the team, pouring the gas on marketing, investing capital into the business, whether that’s raising debt or maybe some sort of equity. And so, we were kind of at a fork in the road when we were approached by this private equity company, and we realized it was just a good period for us to take some chips off the table. Because we had also been working on the business for seven, eight years part-time, two full-time. It was kind of a teeter-totter in between other things. So it’s enough time to be working on a project for somebody who’s more of a builder, to start to get to an itch to say, “Look, is there something else I could be doing? Do I really feel like getting into a manager role, where I’m trying to be more of a resource allocator than an actual builder of product?” And obviously, there was a lot more involved in the emotional side of this decision process making, but a lot of it had to do with just where we were as a business. And I find a lot of other folks that I speak with now, getting to that point, where it’s either double down on what we’re doing and what’s working and invest a lot more resource into it, take less profit, build the team, invest, and kind of assume that risk yourself, or look to divest some of that either through a partial or a full exit. And so, it just happened that, when somebody reached out to us, we were kind of at that inflection point, that fork in the road.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I talk a lot on this show about there being, there’s the venture track, which we kind of know what that means, go big or kind of go home, in essence. And then, we used to say it’s bootstrapping and venture track, and now, we know there’s a lot of nuance in between those things. And even within bootstrapping, and now, I say mostly bootstrapping, which is raising small rounds, there is there are lifestyle bootstrappers and there’s I call it the more ambitious bootstrapper track or growth bootstrapper. And lifestyle bootstrapping is amazing. I had an awesome business doing 30K a month with 2K in expenses, and I work 12 hours a week. And that is, it’s like super cash flow, great lifestyle. But that business was, for reasons, for bunch of reasons, platform risk and churn and such, was never going to be something I ran for 10 years and it was never going to be a million dollar business unless, to your point, I completely changed the way I did things. Because I had a bunch of contractors. Everybody was part-time. I was the hub of the hub and spoke. And that has its pros and cons. At a certain point, I decided “I want to do the growth track, the growth bootstrapper, ambitious bootstrapper,” and that’s where you think, “I want to get to one, 10, 20 million.” And I probably, if you’re going to do that, you want to exit at a certain point. But going down that path, as you said, completely different. It’s like you do start grinding a bit. It’s not as bad as venture, I would say, but it certainly comes with hiring, managing, really going after growth. That becomes your number one, and suddenly, you have no profit, you run a break even, or even you lose money, if you’re able to pull money out of your personal stuff, as I did. And so, I could see being at that inflection point, I can imagine, in your shoes, thinking, “Do I want to go down this road?” And I bet you struggled with that decision for a while. It wasn’t like one week, you thought about that. I bet you thought about it for months, if not a year or two, thinking, “What are we doing with this business?” Because you’ve been doing it a decade, right? That’s a long time to run this same company.  Jon Hainstock:I actually remember attending a MicroConf in Las Vegas with my business partner and being in the hallways with him and just chatting and having this exact conversation, which is, “What are we doing with the business? Where are we going? Where are we headed? Do we want to double down? And do we want to keep focusing on this project? Is this even really what we feel passionate about doing?” Because at that period of time too, I was really a lot more driven by what excited me, less just the practicalities of building a SaaS business. And so, it was a conversation we were having for probably multiple years in there, where it would come up, we would talk about it, “Should we raise? Should we sell? Should we do this or that?” And we kind of just pushed it to the side as we continued doing what we were always doing. And when the opportunity came to sell, that’s really where it brought all of those conversations to the forefront. You had to deal with them, you had to think about them, because there was an actual offer on the table.  Rob Walling:So you exit this business and you and your co-founder walk away. If you’re doing six figures, you walk away with a pretty nice, what I call life-changing money. Even putting half a million dollars in a bank account, for almost all of us, is life-changing, because it gives you that comfort and a little bit of freedom. Maybe it’s “I can take a year or two to do stuff,” and I use half a million dollars as just an example. So you exit, you put money in the bank, and then, what do you do next? And I ask this question, it’s almost a trick question, because here’s what most founders say, “I went on to do my next thing right away.” And here’s what I tell anyone who asks me these days, when they say “I’m going to exit,” I say, “Take three months off, maybe six. Don’t do anything. You can write. You can write in a notebook of all the ideas you have. You can maybe buy domains if you give yourself a 48 hour cooling off period. Do not start another company.” That’s assuming you… If you sell something for 30 grand or a hundred grand or whatever, maybe you don’t take a bunch of time off, but when you have a more sizable exit, especially after working on something for a decade, there should be some time to just let it still. So with that ask Jon, I almost know what your answer’s going to be. What did you do after you sold ZoomShift?  Jon Hainstock:Oh, I did the opposite of that.  Rob Walling:All right.  Jon Hainstock:No, I wish I could say that I was very methodical about my next steps. I was not. I really kind of floundered for a bit, because I didn’t know what I wanted to do and I wasn’t in a position to just not do anything for the rest of my life either. And even if I was, I don’t think that that was really the question I was trying to answer in that period of time. The question I was really trying to figure out is , “What do you really want to do? So take all this away. Now, what do you really want to do with your time? Do you want to do this again? Do you want to start something else or get totally out of software?” And so, for me, I kind of took a little bit of time off, but then, quickly after that, I was talking with friends who are also feeling what I call the itch to create again, to build again. And I was kind of chasing down some ideas. Nothing really amounted to anything, because I was floundering. I was really not sure if this was even what I wanted. And I think there was a pretty big conflict inside me emotionally as to, “Should I do this? Should I do that?” And having my foot in multiple things, not really going all in on anything. So that was a difficult period of time, for sure, before I landed at Quiet Light.  Rob Walling:And that’s pretty common. There’s a book called Finish Big by Bo Burlingham, that talks about finishing big. It talks about selling a company and a little bit more of the psychological aspect of it or the mental health side of “This is going to be hard.” And in that book, they talk a lot about it’s manufacturing companies and storage companies. It’s not necessarily tech, but I think the sentiments, if you worked on any company for a decade and it’s kind of been a mostly full-time focus, I think anyone’s going to feel that. It’s this feeling of being a little lost maybe. And I think, to your point, if you have enough money that you never have to work again, then there’s no pressure. You can get bored, you can take six months off. So after I left Drip, I took six months off, and I got pretty bored and I got restless. I wasn’t like, “Oh my God, I have to make money.” I didn’t have that feeling. It was a luxury of selling for what I did. But if you’re not there yet, then of course, that pressure has to be lingering in your mind of, “I need to start something. I need to start revenue. I’m drawing down on my bank balance every month.” And as bootstrappers, that never feels good. We’re not used to that. That’s something that the funded folks get pretty good at is watching a bank balance drop and being runway and being okay with it. But was that a factor? Were you kind of freaking out a little bit, a little panic attack every time the bank balance dropped 10K?  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, definitely. That weighs into it, for sure. And it wasn’t like an immediate, “Hey, we have to fix this problem immediately.” But what really ate at me more than anything was the emotional side, like you mentioned. And it wasn’t really as much around the financial aspect of it, because we’d be fine. We could go for a while without really feeling a major hurt there. But it was really the psychological aspect of answering the question for myself, “Well, now what? What’s next?” And so, that really weighed on me more than the financial aspect of it. Yeah, the financial aspect of it never feels good to see that money going out and no money coming in, which is kind of what drew me into eventually buying a couple smaller assets as well, small software businesses. But that was secondary to the feeling of restlessness, aimlessness, that was really just there from the exit onward, just trying to figure out, “Well, now what? Well, who am I, to a certain degree? And if I’m not a founder anymore, what does that look like?”  Rob Walling:Yeah, it messes with identity. I talk a lot about my three kind of north stars, freedom, purpose, and relationships. And most of my adult life, I was seeking freedom. And then, you achieve it. You achieved freedom, where it’s like you may have to work years down the line, but you certainly don’t have to work this year or next year or whatever the number is. You have a certain freedom, and you really can call your shots on what to work on next. But what you were lacking was purpose. You achieved the first one and hopefully, had the third one, relationships. But when you don’t have all three of them, it’s disorienting. And it’s fine for a week, it’s fine for two weeks. For months, it’s not. It’s not okay. We lose a part of ourselves, I think, or a part of our humanity perhaps when we don’t have… Especially as entrepreneurs, because we’re so ambitious in wanting to have an impact. So you said it earlier, now, you’re an advisor with Quiet Light. Folks who listen to this show know Quiet Light as a broker that’s been around for what, 15 years or something, sells. It helps people buy and sell SaaS, e-commerce, content sites, WordPress plugin software, just pretty much the gamut. And I want to talk about your experience, your decision to make that leap into it, and then, how that’s been. Also get some tips on buying businesses, right? Buying and/or selling, whatever you want to offer, because folks are always interested in that. Before we get there though, I want to cover this piece you just teased, which was, “Before I went to Quiet Light, I acquired a couple small assets.” I’m assuming websites or web properties of some kind. So how did those go? Were they successful? And I guess, why didn’t you keep going with them? What made you decide to become an advisor at Quiet Light, instead of running more with that path?  Jon Hainstock:So again, as I was trying to work through what would be the next thing, couldn’t sit still and started looking at, at the time, this was MicroAcquire, kind of following the playbook of buy then build. And found a couple interesting small ones that were under $50,000, which is very reasonable for somebody getting started and somebody who’s listening to this, I think it’s a great way to test out entrepreneurship through acquisition. It’s kind of in that 20, 30, 40K range is a great sweet spot to find something. And so, I connected with a few folks there that I felt like were good fits from either a partnership or a full acquisition standpoint. And one I bought was in the trucking space. That one ended up getting to a few thousand in MRR, and we ended up selling it because the partner on that deal just wanted to not do it anymore. And I didn’t really have a strong opinion either way. And so, I’m actually still receiving payments on that one, which is kind of fun to get mailbox money on that one. And so, we sold that one, and then, I bought another one around the 50K mark. And it was just at a multiple and at a price point that just like it was a low risk situation. And so, I ended up buying that, and it’s paid itself back and cash flows every month and makes a few thousand dollars every month, which is great. And then, there’s a couple other ones that I own now, that are kind of similar story. Some of those are partnerships, some of those are owned solely. And why didn’t I focus on this? I think, for me, the main reason is because when I was exposed to Quiet Light and the work there, it checked off the purpose box for me more than this other kind of portfolio of software companies did. It really checked off that box for me, because I was able to help entrepreneurs sell their business. I was able to help them during a period of time, which is very challenging to navigate,, practically speaking emotionally, all those things, and try to give them the advice that I wish I had when I was going through that not too long ago. And so, it was super rewarding going through that cycle. And I had kind of acquired some of these assets along the way, and they help and serve as a way to offset some of the ebbs and flows of advising and brokering, which is deals come and go. And lots of times, they fall apart, because that’s what deals do. And this kind of gives us stability of revenue and income through these smaller assets. And so, that’s what appeals to me about them. I really enjoy them, but I don’t have any desire to make those my full-time thing at this point. Because I really am enjoying the advising side of things.  Rob Walling:What you’re saying is triggering this memory of mine of the one thing that I think Robert Kiyosaki who wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad and now, this huge empire of info products. I don’t particularly like most of his stuff. I think his first book, there’s Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens, and I’ve had my oldest child read that. And I think it’s super cool. A lot of the other stuff, I think he just repeats himself in different ways. But there’s one framework that I’ve always loved of his, which is he has it as four quadrants, but let’s just say bottom to top. At the bottom is where most of us start as an employee. And then, many of us become self-employed. And this is when you’re a freelancer or a contractor where you say, “I’m an entrepreneur,” but realistically, I did this for years, dollars for hours. “I’m really just employed for myself and I can decide who to work for, but it’s dollars for hours.” And then, the next step up is an entrepreneur, which is where you’re running ZoomShift. You’re leveraging assets like software and employees, other people’s labor, where you’re paying them and then, you’re making money on that and don’t necessarily have to work 40 hours a week to make a full-time salary at that point. And then, the level above that is investor, and that’s where you are potentially acquiring assets, that are just much more passive. Either someone else runs them or in this day and age, Kiyosaki didn’t write about this back in the day 20 years ago when he wrote the book, but these days, it’s like you can get some passive investments, where they kind of go along with minimal involvement. And it sounds like you’re entrepreneur with ZoomShift, and then, as you acquired these other business, I’m guessing you worked on them and in them for a while, but have almost stepped back to the point of being an investor, where it’s more passive income. I’m careful with this phrase “passive income,” because really, there’s no SaaS company, for example, that’s on permanent autopilot. It just doesn’t happen. They always decline, because Google smacks you, because a competitor comes along. It just happens. I’ve never seen one that’s like, “Oh man, I had this SaaS company 10 years, and it was just passive the whole time.” It’s like, nah, let’s be real. But with that said, you can still be an investor in companies and need to invest periodically to hire to replace someone or to beef up the SEO or whatever. And being an investor is fun, but it can be boring too. And as you said, if that’s not a big interest of yours, then trying to find something else to give you purpose, I could imagine wanting to do that. And at Quiet Light, you’re able to work with a team of other people, which oftentimes gives us purpose, because we’re communal beings as humans. So I’m curious then, leading us into that piece of it, why Quiet Light? And how did that happen? Did you approach Quiet Light? Did they approach you?  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, they approached me. I was actually on the Quiet Light Podcast telling the story of selling Zoomshift shortly after it happened. And it was through a friend of a friend that knew the co-founder there, Mark. And so, I didn’t really know anything about Quiet Light, except for one interaction I’d had with a broker, when I was thinking about selling Zoomshift and we were going through that process. So I didn’t know much about the industry, didn’t know much about even how they thought about brokering. And I had a chat with the founder there. And what I realized was fundamentally different about the way that they approach things versus some of the other folks that I’d spoken with in the industry is that they kind of come at it from the perspective of working with advisors who have been there and done that. There are other entrepreneurs who have already gone through this process and been on the sell side and sat in that seat and actually have gone through the ups and downs of growing a business and then, eventually exiting it, sometimes multiple businesses. And so, I liked that approach. It was different from what I had seen before, which was a little bit more mechanical or investment bank. It just felt different, almost like shuffling along inventory through a real estate kind of process or something. And so, I really liked their approach. And meeting some of the team there solidified kind of what I felt about the business, in terms of its values and the people involved. Just stellar people, every single one of the folks that I spoke with before coming on just very real and very eager to help, even though they didn’t know if I was coming on or not. There was a spirit of collaboration, not just competition among the team members there. So that was a big part of it. And then, I wanted to try something different. I wanted to get out of, even the last year of experimenting with some of these other ideas and trying little projects, I wanted to try to put on a different hat completely and see what it felt like to be in a different role, in an advising role, a role where you’re not in the active operating seat at all times. And I just wanted to see what that was like. And I came to realize it was something that I could really enjoy, I was decent at, I felt like I could really connect with entrepreneurs. And that, to me, was a huge bonus of the job is just being able to talk with folks. Even if they didn’t decide to work with me, it was just great to connect with them, because you have that human element, like you mentioned before, the relational side. And so, to me, it was a great opportunity to try something different, to stretch and learn some new skills. And it’s been great so far. I’ve really enjoyed it.  Rob Walling:Yeah, I find that learning is a huge part of entrepreneurial purpose. Most of us, as entrepreneurs, if we’re not learning or growing, just don’t have that, right? And so, stepping into something new, I think, is super interesting. And to your point of being generous with your advice, there’s no string attached, if someone were to DM you on Twitter, by the way, you’re Jon, J-O-N, Hainstock, H-A-I-N-S-T-O-C-K, on Twitter, your DMs are open, and if folks want to ping you and ask you your advice or ask you whether it’s about your experience or how they should think it through or whatever, you’ve never been the person to say, “Oh, well now I want to sell you something. Now you should come work with me. Well, now you owe me.” It’s like, you’re not that type of person, right? I’ve known you long enough to know that. So I have an interesting question for you, and I’m curious to get your take on this, broker versus advisor? It’s terminology. Quiet Light calls their folks who advise and help people buy or sell companies, they call them advisors. I typically say Quiet light is a brokerage. So some people might think, “Well, people who work there are brokers,” but I don’t know enough to know how you think about this or how the industry thinks about it.  Jon Hainstock:Yeah, so the actual company name, I believe, is Quiet Light Brokerage Incorporated. So from outside appearances and when trying to communicate, comparing us to other organizations, it’s definitely what we position as. We are a brokerage. We have a marketplace of businesses that we help sell. I think, for me, there was a stigma around the term being a broker, because of what I imagined that person to be. I imagined it to be kind of like used car sales person, whatever it was, try to finagle you into doing business, so that they could take a commission or whatever it was. And so, I think that part of it was difficult for me, psychologically, to overcome and identify with. It’s like, yeah, no, I’m an advisor. You can call me a broker. But ultimately, from my position, the goal is to help you maximize your exit and to help you through that process, which is very difficult. I want to help make sure that you get what you’re looking for out of this process. You can call me a broker. You can call me an advisor. The stigma around the broker term, I think, is just due to some of the either tactics or the types of ways that people have tried to engage with entrepreneurs and to try to get their business and take commissions and this and that. And so, I think, for me, it was hard, because as a founder entrepreneur, in that seat, I had a hard time with that outside opinion of that role. And so, accepting that as an identity, it was a little difficult at first, but they’re one and the same. We are primarily sell side focused, and so, we advocate for the seller at Quiet Light. But a lot of sellers go on to be buyers. And a lot of the buyers that we work with keep coming back to us, because they trust what we do. And so, it is, yeah, we do sit in the middle here and we do try to help broker the deal, but there’s a lot of things that go into that, that do look more like an advisor, trying to prepare your business for sale before you sell, not just at the moment that you are going to market, but six months, a year in advance, what should you be thinking about? And all those types of things. So yeah, we’ve moved more into the terminology of advising and the advisors, instead of brokers. But ultimately, yeah, we’re a brokerage. We help facilitate the sale of businesses.  Rob Walling:Makes a lot of sense. And so, I want to get your advice. You’ve bought companies, you’ve sold companies. I’m sure you have some advice on maybe pitfalls to avoid when if someone wants to buy a business. I know there’s a lot of different things that people think about, and I know there’s some it depends as well, but as we kind of move towards wrapping up, if someone’s in the audience, I get this question every once in a while, so I’m a huge proponent of buying businesses. And in fact, I’ve tried to think back recently of all the companies that I’ve had or all the kind of revenue generating products I’ve had, I think I may have bought slightly more than I’ve started myself. If I can skip product market fit, if I can skip 18 months, and I have the money to do it, I was doing it all day and all night from 2006 till, I guess the last one I bought was 2011. So there’s about five years there, where I acquired literally dozens of web properties. A lot was software, there was like two SaaS, and then, there was all the other things, eBooks, and just anything, content sites, whatever. So I’ve always been a proponent of it. I’ve found that most people who listen to this podcast, they want to build their own thing, and that’s fine. But in the early days, when I was really coming in starting to teach, “Hey, if you’re a technical person trying to be a software entrepreneur, don’t go the venture track, do this,” I would say, “Try to buy a business.” I bought the businesses. That’s been the fastest way to get there. And yet, most people don’t want to, which is fine. But I know that there are folks listening to this, because I get a question every few months about this topic of, “I’m thinking about acquisition entrepreneurship.” And I’ve run through the pros and cons of it here, but you, as, I would say, an expert in this space, what should someone be thinking about? What are some common pitfalls to avoid when they’re going to be buying a business?  Jon Hainstock:So I think, first, it gets down to your expectations and the motivations, the things that you’re trying to accomplish by doing this. I think you do get to skip some of the product market fit aspect of it, if you’re able to find something that has some traction, that has some net profit. I think one of the big benefits too, that a lot of people may miss, is that you are essentially buying cash flows. And so, you’re getting the code, you’re getting the product, the marketing kind of base of it for free in a sense, because you’re buying a multiple on the cash flows typically, kind of at the smaller level, not on revenues, or if the revenues are matched, really close to the cash flows, it’s very similar. But you’re kind of getting a lot of what has been already built for free in a way, because you’re, like I said, you’re buying these cash flows that won’t dry up most likely in the next year or two. And so, with that in mind, I would say the biggest thing is to look out for downside protection. Everything is about mitigating risk. And so, understanding that there’s various aspects of the business that are going to expose you to risk, whether that’s on the channel side, how people are acquiring customers, whether that’s on the technology side, being in a very antiquated tech that will be difficult for you to find contractors or to be able to resell someday, every single deal you see will have risk associated with it. And so, to assume and look for the risks as you go through that process, and this is pre-due diligence, trying to understand the history of the business, both from the financial side, as well as the technical side. And then, once you’re under offer, not rushing through due diligence, making sure that you’re actually checking and verifying that the information that they provided is accurate and correct. So not rushing that process and making sure that you have built into your model the way that you’re kind of considering this to be a good or bad investment, that you’re willing to walk away from it when it doesn’t look right, you’re willing to take the loss, if it’s a calculated risk. And in the case of the one that I bought earlier, that I was telling you about, it was very low multiple, so it was a high risk in one sense, but low risk in a cash sense. And so, I think just having an understanding of those things as you’re looking at the business. Happy to provide more specific guidance as you get into the nitty gritty of a deal or something. But those are the things to really think about, in terms of the buckets of risk. You have your financial, your technical, the team, if you’re buying things like that, and acquisition on the marketing end. And so, seeing it through that frame is really useful. And then, from there, I think one of the best things you can do, if you’re really deal hunting, is to come up with your own criteria. Come up with something that really matches your strengths and plays to those things. So if you are really good at, let’s just say, SEO, and you’ve done this before in another business, look for businesses where you’ve examined them in Ahrefs and they’re not doing a good job there. And you know that, if you put five, six months into building some high quality articles, that you’ll be able to start ranking and getting traffic that way. So look for the angles that are specific to your skillset. Don’t just look for a great deal necessarily. Look for things that actually you can provide some extra value add, because those are the investments that always do the best is when you can provide some extra value to the deal or you have some knowledge that can actually provide some insight that they might be missing. Maybe it’s around pricing strategy, maybe it’s around product and product development, some key things that they’re missing. And you look at their competitors, and it’s like, “Hey, they have all these people are requesting this feature, and I know if I add this feature, I can start grabbing those customers.” So I think it’s both strategic and practical to think through that lens of what is your criteria, and then, try not to deviate from that. So if your background, let’s say you’re a Ruby on Rails shop and you start looking at all these deals and you start seeing deals that are Laravel or you have another deal that’s in Next.js or something, try to be disciplined to find the deals where you can really provide the most value. And I know this is probably common sense, but I think it can be difficult when you see something pop up and you’re like, “Oh, this is it. This is the one,” be patient and really kind of make sure that you’re doing your homework before pulling the trigger, even on a 20, $30,000 website.  Rob Walling:Patience is so huge. Patience when you’re buying a house and you’re buying commercial real estate, I buy collectibles, and I find, when I’m in a hurry and I’m like, “Oh, I really need to get this,” I just pay too much or I make bad decisions. Like you said, your Rail shop and you buy a Laravel app, that’s not the end of the world, but it’s like, ugh, that’s a lot to deal with. It’s like, “Am I going to hire someone? Are they going to be full-time? Do I vet them?” What do you do with that? I like the way you said, if you have an expertise, especially a marketing expertise, that you see they’re doing very poorly and you can feel like you can optimize, use that as kind of a superpower. That’s exactly what I did for that five, six year stint is the first thing that I learned was SEO. And I kind of taught myself/learned it/then acquired something that had halfway decent SEO. So then, by the time I was getting that into a flywheel, I was like, “Oh, I kind of know more than most people, especially most developers about SEO.” So then, I would just gobble up these little projects, that were, at the time, they cost, let’s say, five, 10K each, but the multiples were way low back then. This is kind of pre… It’s pre the Quiet Lights almost. And so, the multiples, I would get stuff for 12 to 18 months of net profit, which is bananas when you say that today. But the risk was huge. It was me dealing with a seller, and I had someone basically forge revenue stuff that I couldn’t verify. It was shenanigans, right? But you had to buy it a low multiple, such that you could get around that. But through that, then I would just look at something and exactly what you said, I’d go and be like, “Oh, they’re not doing any SEO and there’s a ton of traffic for these terms.” So then, I’d buy it, SEO it, autopilot it, and then, move on. And through that, I learned, this is where I built my marketing tool belt. So much of what I learned about marketing was from reading info marketing books, internet marketing books back in the day. And then, doing this SEO, I learned AdWords. I learned how to do display ads at a certain point, online display ads and Facebook ads, and then, messing with pricing, all the touchpoints here. You just said SEO and pricing. But these are things that you can learn on the job, so to speak. Once you own and have skin in the game, it’s super interesting how quickly you learn. And you go from the theory of listening to this podcast and watching Hacker News or reading a book to, suddenly, you have to make the hard decisions with maybe incomplete information around it. But if you can develop that tool belt one at a time, it makes you so much more capable of running your own show. And whether you acquire in the long term or whether you build something later, you still have that skillset that you can use.  Jon Hainstock:Yeah. And ultimately, if the goal is to scale up and do this at a larger level, maybe some of these take off and your goal is a little bit to be more ambitious and to get to a mid eight figure exit or something like that, if you don’t have the skills and the understanding around some of what it takes to run the SaaS business, this is a great way to get started with pretty low stakes, but having skin in the game, it’s not theory. You’re in it. And then, you can kind of move out of being an operator and all that stuff to finding the whos, that are going to help you take it to the next level, which I think is really where you need to graduate to scale the business. But I think, in the early stages, it can be so rewarding to get your hands on something, get your hands dirty, and try to make some improvements and see those actually work. And you’re not spending all of your time in a basement coding out your MVP and wondering if anybody’s going to use it. You have maybe a thousand dollars a month, $500 a month that’s coming in, that you get to see every single day when you wake up. You see something new in Stripe, which is just a huge motivator when you open up the app and you see money coming in, and you are sleeping. So I think everybody should really look at this as a way to invest. Because if you have the skills, if you’re listening to this, you probably have some of those skills already developed. And to put them into action, think about how much it would cost to go to grad school, think about how much it would cost to level up your education, you can do that by buying something small and taking a ton from that. And the marketplaces are very mature now, so that worst case scenario, you can sell at a low multiple and probably still not lose money. So I think it’s a lot lower risk than people do see it sometimes. Obviously, there’s risks around platforms and things changing. We’ve seen some of these Twitter based apps going away or Reddit based apps and stuff, and that’s super sad. But I think that, in general, the risks are not necessarily as high as you might imagine them to be, especially kind of in this lower, call it, 10 to 50K range.  Rob Walling:I like that you mentioned kind of learning things and then, stair stepping up into larger SaaS, because honestly, so little known facts, similar stair step approach or stair step method of entrepreneurship that I have, it used to say step one and two were build or buy. Build or buy. And I just pulled out the buy, because no one was listening to me, Jon. But that’s why I like, every once in a while, just calling it out like, “Hey, I get it. It’s not for everyone. Everyone doesn’t have 10 to $50,000 in their bank account.” We get it. But it is something people should think about. It is a path that you traveled. It’s a path that I traveled. It’s a path… Honestly, if you go read the stair step blog post, the essay I wrote about it, I think about half of the entrepreneurs I mentioned actually bought their thing, bought their WordPress plugin, or bought the… It’s just the way it wound up. So everyone thinks about building, and that’s an okay way to go too. But I think it’s a lesser talked about avenue to buy. Jon Hainstock, thanks so much for joining me on the show. Again, on Twitter, you are J-O-N-H-A-I-N-S-T-O-C-K. Your DMs are open.

People say, “What’s the difference of those who succeed in those who don’t?” And one of the things I say is those who succeed generally work on things that move the needle. Welcome to this week’s episode of Startups For the Rest Of Us. I’m your host, Rob Walling, and this is the show where I talk about bootstrapping and mostly bootstrapping tech companies, software companies, software as a service. It’s funny to think back 10, 11, 12 years where software as a service in SaaS was a term that was around, but it wasn’t obvious that it was going to take over the world. These days, and obviously for the past 5, 6, 7 years, we’ve really focused on that. It is the best business model in the world. I have half a chapter in my new book all about why SaaS is so amazing and really it starts with recurring revenue and that drives everything else. Today, we have a Rob Solo adventure. I’m going to start by looking at what it looks like to work on the right things versus the wrong things, and specifically what it looks like to work on something that moves the needle versus something that you’re comfortable with. I have a startup, SaaS specific example of this. Then, I’m going to talk a little bit about left-handed threads, and I’ll leave that as the teaser for that segment. Then, I’ll talk about how your choice of words matters and how using the word luck in a sentence can be an indicator of how you view the world and an indicator of why you’re not succeeding yet. Then, if we have more time, I’ll dive into more topics after that. The first topic for today is about working on what will actually move the needle rather than what you are comfortable with. I know a couple startup founders, and I wish I could call them Goofus and Gallant back from the old highlights for children days, but in this case, let’s just say it’s founder A and founder B, neither of whom are TinySeed founders, I should clarify. What I’ve had happen in the past is I’ll give examples of someone making a mistake and I’ll have someone reach out to me and be like, “Hey, were you talking about me in that episode?” No, usually in almost all cases I’m not. It’s probably someone that you don’t know. Founder A and founder B run similar SaaS companies in the same space and they are competing against one another. In this moderately contrived example, both founders are looking for ways to market their startup to a very specific niche. Let’s pick the niche of freelance designers, probably freelance web designers just to be specific. As they’re looking at the ways to market to this segment, to this customer type, one chooses to build a community for freelance web designers from scratch. Whether that’s a Facebook community or probably a Slack community if we’re thinking of web designers, maybe if they were CEOs of construction firms or folks in, I’ll say less tech-savvy areas, it might be a Facebook group or a proprietary forums or something. Founder A decides to build a community from scratch to bring these freelance web designers together and to provide them with a place where they can gather, ask questions, commiserate, you know what happens in online communities. If you’re part of MicroConf Connect, how amazing that can be. You also might know how much work that is, but that’s what founder A does. Founder B, instead of building a community decides to build a directory of freelance web designers. That directory has several benefits to it. One is obviously there might be some SEO play there where you build a lot of pages with names and keywords and you get inbound links if it’s a good directory. Then the benefit to those freelancers who are listed is that they could potentially get business from this, right? Because that’s essentially what they’re probably looking to do. They’re looking to up level their own skill, they’re looking to be able to charge more over time, and they’re looking to find more work. The more work they have, the more they’re able to charge over time. These are two perfectly viable options. On the surface, both of these seem reasonable. You want to gather your customers in a place, you want to have a relationship with your prospects such that they think of you when it comes time to buy your software. The problem is one of these is mostly a one-time investment of work, and it comes with a ton of potential benefits to the freelancers, and that is the directory of freelancers. As I already said, it can provide them with inbound interest, it can provide them with more business. Over time it can allow them to raise their rate and the amount of work for each individual who joins is negligible. Even getting it started, it’s setting up some pages, whether you’re doing this manually with no code, whether you have an actual SaaS that you’re paying for to have a directory, it’s not a ton of community management I’ll say. Right? It’s some nuts and bolts. Let’s optimize this. People can fill this in and then let’s approve or disapprove or whatever. And then let’s market this thing and let’s get the links and let’s get the SEO. That in my opinion, is a great approach, assuming that works in your space, it obviously depends on a lot of factors. First is founder A who has built a community which comes with a tremendous burden and a workload and an expertise … Hiring a community manager is nowhere near as easy as hiring someone who can, let’s say, manage a directory for what that even amounts to. In addition, a community is going to be private, so there’s really no SEO benefit. Maybe you have a landing page or something, but now you’re trying to get enough people in there that you need the community to work. It doesn’t work with 10 people. A directory does. In fact, a directory if you are marketing it well is actually better with only 10 people because then there aren’t that many choices and the freelancers that are on it are getting more benefit. I want to bring this up not specifically to say, “Oh, directories are better than communities.” For crying out loud, how many communities have I started and run in my career? How many directories have I done? I’ve done both these things and it’s about the time and the place and the value and how much effort you want to put in and whether that is core to your business. With MicroConf, community is the central focus of the entire effort. That’s what MicroConf is. When I draw everything that MicroConf offers, the center circle says community, the people, and then everything is off of that. Like, hey, there’s a circle out here that is the Slack group, and there’s a circle out here where if you are bootstrapping and you want funding, then TinySeed’s attached there. If you want to be in a mastermind, we have Matching. If you want education, you could probably buy one of my books or go to our YouTube channel for free or to this podcast. Each of these things is around the community. The community is the focus, and we spend a lot of time and money moderating that community. MicroConfconnect.com if you haven’t checked it out. If I were running a SaaS aimed at a niche community would be far down on the list of things that I wanted to start unless I felt like there was an extreme vacuum in the space and I already had an audience where I could kickstart that community. For me, if I was thinking about community, I’d be like, “Okay, but first I have to start a podcast or I have to start a blog. I have need enough of an audience or I need thousands of customers that the community builds itself.” It’s just a long road to go and it’s a ton of work. This kind of example is so apparent when you compare these two approaches because people ask me often, “What makes an entrepreneur successful across the …” I don’t know, I think the number’s got to be 300 now in terms of founders across the 151 companies I’m invested in. People say, “What’s the difference of those who succeed in those who don’t?” One of the things I say is, “Those who succeed generally work on things that move the needle, and they’re not afraid to fail, but in general, they don’t fail that much.” Whether it’s 70-30 or 80-20, whatever their ratio is, they analyze stuff well enough, they take the numbers into account, they think it through. They don’t just think, “What’s comfortable for me?” “Well, I’ve done podcasts my whole life, so everything is a podcast. When I see a nail, I’m going to try to hammer it in with a podcast because that’s what I do.” They don’t do that. The best founders put that aside and they say, “What is actually the best approach for building an audience or for reaching my prospects in this space?” Rather than going with what I know or what I’m comfortable with. Obviously, you want to blend that a little bit. If you’re really good at something and you’re exceptional, of course you can double down on it. But I see entrepreneurs who just can’t leave their own comfort zone and they won’t try cold outbound, they won’t try pay-per-click ads because in quotes, “They never work.” “They don’t work in my space.” It’s like, no, they [inaudible] work. Google is not a cajillion dollar company because ads don’t work. It is frustrating to me when I hear entrepreneurs who are getting in their own way and they have these limiting beliefs, this limited mindset of, well, this doesn’t work in my space, or this doesn’t work in general because I tried it once. What that leads to is you staying in your own comfort zone and doing the things that you’re comfortable with, and those are not always the things that are going to move your needle. Again, before I hear a comment on Twitter or on startupsfortherestofus.com, I’m not saying directories in every case are better than communities, is not the point of this. The point is to work on things that you think are going to move the needle and to get advice from experienced founders to get some data or to make a great gut feel, your best gut feel on what to work on next. Because working on the smart thing rather than what you want to do or what you see other people doing is the approach that’s going to get you to where you want to go. Finding the perfect software engineer for your team can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, and the process can quickly become overwhelming.

Most of us know righty-tighty, lefty-loosey. If I’m going to screw a bolt in, I’m going to screw it to the right and that will make it go in and then to the left makes it come out. There’s certain applications where that doesn’t make sense. For example, when you’re putting a bicycle together, the left pedal can’t be a standard thread, a right-handed thread because it will unscrew and come off as you pedal it because you’re pedaling it to the left and you’re going to give it friction and unscrew it. The fact that threads are right-handed is completely arbitrary, but it is the way the world works these days. A couple months ago, I walked in on my teenager, my 16 year old, and he was trying to assemble something, and I don’t remember it was IKEA furniture, I think it was a standing desk. Sherry and I ordered a separate standing desk that is kind of our media center for recording YouTube videos and all that. There was one thread on it that needed to be left-handed for reasons that aren’t particularly relevant to this story. He sat there for 15 minutes, he couldn’t get it in because he had never heard of a left-handed thread. He is left-handed himself, but it had never occurred to him that you could screw something in by lefty-tighty, righty-loosey. It breaks your brain. What was funny is I came in and he said, “I just can’t get this screw in.” And I said, “I think it’s a left-handed thread.” And he said, “A what?” And I flashed back to when I was probably younger than him, I was probably about 10 years old, and I was putting together what was, I think it was a compass or protractor, one of these things for geometry, fifth or sixth grade. I remember it needed a left-handed thread because for the same reasons. Right? Because if you moved to the compass, it would unscrew it. I had never seen one, I didn’t even know it existed. My dad, who’s an electrician, construction worker his whole life obviously had experience with these. And he came in and said, I said, “I’ve been screwing this thing in for 15 minutes. It just won’t go.” He screwed it left-handed and I was like, “I can’t believe that. I didn’t even know this was an option.” Right? But once you see it’s like, well, of course it’s an option. It’s just the threads just go the other way. This is the kind of thing where being exposed to it once, you’ll never forget. I will never forget the moment when I first heard about left-handed threads, and I don’t think my 16-year-old will either. Just having that exposure and realizing that this can exist is an important developmental step in our journeys as human beings and learning how things work. Similarly, as I bring this back to startups and being a founder and a bootstrapper running SaaS companies, there are certain things you haven’t been exposed to. Just knowing that they exist and having a vague idea of how to handle them can be incredibly beneficial. That’s where while I’ve become a just-in-time learner, which is someone who when I need to learn something, I find a book or I talk to an expert and I try to learn it in a week and then go do it. But back 10, 15, 20 years ago, I needed exposure to a lot of things because I just didn’t know. I didn’t really know anything. You have this huge sea of blackness. These days when I look out over the huge sea, there’s like spots of knowledge that I don’t have, but I know enough to know what I don’t know. When you’re dealing with a left-handed thread, you don’t know enough to know what you don’t know because you’ve never been exposed to it. My point to this is early on in your entrepreneurial journey or your career, whatever you’re doing professionally, I think you need to be exposed to a lot of things. I think that’s why a college education, while I am really torn on our boys going to college because I just don’t think the value is there for the cost, I do think that getting exposure to a wide variety of topics and subjects expands your mind and it can help you figure out what you love doing and what clicks with you. In fact, if I hadn’t gone into electrical engineering, became a construction worker, I was going to eventually be an electrical engineer, I probably would’ve done computer vision because even as an undergrad, I took multiple graduate level computer vision courses and I loved them. It was so fascinating, and that was an experience that I never could have had without being exposed to a lot of things. I think that’s why listening to a lot of audiobooks, you’ve probably heard me talk about how I have now 865 audiobooks in my Audible account. I think that’s why founders who I see that are doing well are lifelong readers and learners. That’s why so many of the founders that we know and aspiring founders as well listen to podcasts is because the exposure to these different topics and to hearing what a left-handed thread is or to hearing that once you do something in public, you’re going to have criticism or you’re going to get flamed online for doing something at some point. Just realize that is a thing like a left-handed thread, it does exist. The first time you’re asked, “Hey, can we jump on a quick call? I just have some questions for you about your $30 one-time purchase product or $10 a month product.” You’re going to get these. How do you react to that just in advance knowing that that’s going to happen? So you’re not caught flatfooted and having to go to Reddit or somewhere else to ask a question? The first time someone asks you for a discount when you get an enterprise checklist sent for your $300 piece of software like I did back in 2008, and I said, “Yeah, this is hours of work and it’s $300 one time fee with a 20% annual maintenance thing, so $60 a year.” And I said, “Our sales model doesn’t work that way. Sorry.” And that dude got so mad, so mad, “I can’t believe you even run a business. You don’t deserve our money, blah, blah, blah.” Then, later I got an apology email from a colleague of his who said, “Yeah, he doesn’t really understand how things work.” And I said, “Look, if you want me to fill out this checklist, I need to charge you 10 times, 20 times what I’m charging. Frankly, I don’t think we are the software for you based on how you’re buying.” I had to go through these things and learn them myself, which is fine. It’s a weird thing to say, but I was like the pioneer taking the arrows in the back. The only person I knew who was blogging or talking about being a real software company that didn’t raise venture capital was Joel Spolski with Fog Creek Software. Started reading his blog in 2001. I started my blog in 2005. I didn’t know anyone else talking about it. Then there was Peldi and Patrick McKenzie over the next two or three years, Patio11 as most of you may know, and Peldi is the founder of Balsamiq. That was it. And I was learning from them as much as I, they’ve told me they were learning from me. This was from 2005 to say 2007-2008. Then Jason Cohen, I think, started his blog in 2008 or 2009, but this was it. We were learning stuff on our own. We had to figure out, “Oh, there are left-handed threads.” And, “Oh, B2C is actually really crappy and B2B is going to be superior in almost every way.” And, “Oh, we really should charge more. All of us are undercharging.” On and on and on. The best practices that you hear in our spheres today were discovered in those years. Then as MicroConf started, and as we got Jason Cohen, and Heaton Shaw, and Patio11, and Stelli Efty, and myself and other people in a room to do these talks that you now see on YouTube, we were learning those things as we went. They weren’t just in the gestalt. To wrap up this topic, what I’m saying is I do think that exposure when you’re first getting started to a broad variety of aspects of startup topics, whether it’s through a podcast like this or through books or through online communities like MicroConf or Twitter. Right? There’s a great ecosystem there with MicroConf founders and beyond. There’s a real advantage to kind of having almost a liberal arts approach. You know what a liberal arts degree is. Right? It’s where you go and you just learn about a bunch of different things. Now, I think there should be some science mixed in there and some engineering, or not just philosophy and psychology and all the other things, but taking that approach that you would take in your first two years of college where you’re just getting a bunch of general education, I think that is pretty important for a lot of us so that we know what exists out there. We may not know how to deal with every solution, but at least then we’ll know who to ask. We’ll know where to go, and we will understand that indeed left-handed threads do exist in this world. My last topic for today on this Rob solo adventure comes from a comment made on the MicroConf YouTube channel, and I wish I remembered which video it was, but it was a video where I was talking about how to come up with startup ideas. I think that was it. It was kind of a framework, seven approaches for coming up with SaaS ideas. The first of those seven reasons included asking yourself, what are your unfair advantages? Do you have an audience? Do you have a network? Are you early to a space? And then on and on and on, and it’s a 12 to 15 minute video. It’s actually quite dense. I pulled it from a chapter of my next book, oh my gosh, am I really saying this? While I was writing the SaaS playbook, I realized there was a whole chunk of more early stage stuff that was really idea phase and idea validation and all that, that it just didn’t belong in the SASS playbook. I think there’s like 30,000 words, so it’s kind of 100 … What is that 140, 150 page book? I have that in a Google Doc and I need to figure out what I’m going to do with it. But the bottom line is these seven things for this YouTube video came out of that. I talked through a lot of different ways to come up with ideas and frameworks and patterns, and we’ll link that up in the show notes if you want to see it. One of the comments was so striking to me because the commenter said, “I’ve heard that YouTube best practices are to give something that excites people in the first two minutes. I’m four minutes in, and all I’m hearing about is what I can do if I’m lucky enough to have an audience or a network.” Lucky enough, think of what that word means. No one lucks into an audience or a network. I don’t know of anyone that has, I talk about hard work, luck, and skill. Of those three, I think an audience and a network both take hell of a lot of hard work. Eventually, I would say I was not skilled at building an audience, nor at building a network and eventually you figure it out with enough hard work. But I was struck by that word lucky, because what does it imply? It implies that if you don’t have it’s not your fault. That somehow you didn’t buy the winning lottery ticket to suddenly have a podcast with 35,000 listeners, or you didn’t luck into a YouTube channel with 62,000 subscribers. I don’t tend to be pedantic about people’s sentences or phrasing, but to use the word lucky in that context, it shows a certain mindset, a belief that you have to be lucky to have these things. If you’ve listened to me long enough, I hope you know that’s not true. You don’t have to be lucky to get rich. You don’t have to be lucky to build an audience. You don’t have to be lucky to build a SaaS company to 10K a month that can change your life. You don’t have to be lucky to build an incredible network. You don’t have to be lucky to be a successful entrepreneur. Now, hard work, luck, and skill are all always three factors, and the more luck you have, great, but don’t count on it. Put in the hard work and learn the skill and do the work. That’s what I would tell this commenter is it sounds like you are making an excuse that you don’t have something because you don’t want to record 671 podcast episodes over the next 13 years. And once you’ve done that, if you’re not lucky enough to have the audience of your dreams, then you can totally come and talk to me at that point. And I will say, you know what? I was wrong. But what happens in these conversations is folks who think that way, who think that this is all luck, mostly luck. Those are the folks that don’t ship. They don’t put in the time because they think that luck has so much to do with it and that they’re not “a lucky person”. And if you’ve learned anything over the past 671 episodes of this podcast, I hope that sharing my journey and the journey of so many of the founders who I’ve spoken with on this show has shown you that while luck can be a factor, it’s not a requirement. Also, that commenter was right. I was four, four and a half minutes into a 13-minute video, and I should have gotten to the point faster. I appreciated the sentiment he was trying to communicate. I just don’t necessarily want others to believe that you need to be lucky to have an audience or a network or a successful company. Speaking of luck, I’m lucky enough to be wrapping up episode 671 of this podcast, and I have a call with the podcast production team here in one minute. This is Rob Walling signing off. I’ll see you next week.","PublishedAt":"July 25, 2023","Url":"https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-671-working-on-what-matters-left-handed-threads-and-being-lucky-a-rob-solo-adventure"},{"Title":"Episode 670 | Relying on Luck, Avoiding Burnout, and Bad Player vs. Bad Instrument (A Rob Solo Adventure)","Content":"Startups For the Rest of Us\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEpisode 670 | Relying on Luck, Avoiding Burnout, and Bad Player vs. Bad Instrument (A Rob Solo Adventure)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlay Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPause Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMute/Unmute Episode\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRewind 10 Seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1x\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast Forward 30 seconds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t00:00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26:25\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Podcasts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotify\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStitcher\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRSS Feed\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLink\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEmbed\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\nDownload file | Play in new window | Duration: 26:25 | Recorded on July 5, 2023\t\n\t\tFacebookLinkedInTwitterEmail\t\n\t\nIn episode 670, join Rob Walling for another solo adventure, where he discusses why, while striking luck in your SaaS journey is great, working hard and building skills is the sustainable way to build businesses for the long haul.

You count on shooting the gap and being there just at the right time as the technology catches up. That’s not a great path. It’s not repeatable. If you want to go for one in a million and buy a lottery ticket, you can do that, right? That’s the venture funded path. But trying to be a boot strapper and rely on luck is super dangerous. It’s Startups For The Rest Of Us. I’m Rob Walling. I’m your host as I have been for the past 13 some odd years, 670-ish episodes. Funny story, episode 666 came out just a few weeks back and, of course, there were the requisite jokes and death metal memes on Twitter, which I thought was super fun. And just a few days after 666 came out, it really wanted to be the final episode because our RSS feed stopped updating. And when 667 came out, which was the episode where John Warlow and I talked about building SOPs and increasing the value of your company, it wasn’t appearing in most podcast apps. And so I spent a day or two troubleshooting and after, I mean it was, I said five hours on Twitter, it was more like 8, 9, 10 hours back and forth. We had this really old system that was set up kind of before podcast hosts, because traditionally these days you would just use their feed URL, but we’ve been around since before there were podcast hosts. And so although we host with Castos, we were not using their feed URL. And so 8, 9, 10 hours later with support from our old provider, I just decided that we should pull the plug and move our way over to fully embrace the Castos ecosystem. So a day or two later, we were all set up and now everything’s in one place and cashed and handled by the trusty folks over at Castos. But it was quite a journey. It’s that moment in your startup where you think to yourself, “I don’t want to be doing this.” You’ll hear me talk a little later in this episode about some, I’d say burnout may be a strong word, but I’m entering, I can feel myself approaching burnout. I can see it in the distance. I’ll go into more details later. But when I feel that way, I don’t want to work on bull [inaudible] tasks, which is [inaudible] around with my RSS feed. It’s like the last thing you want to be doing. It’s like you buy a brand new house and everything’s amazing, and then the plumbing line goes out, or the sewage line breaks or some electrical thing that really needs to work goes out. And so you have to spend a bunch of money or a bunch of time fixing it. That’s how it feels when this happens with the RSS feed. And so every X amount of years something goes wrong with it, and I’m just glad to be on the other side of it. So hopefully, if you’re hearing this episode, everything is now fixed and you have the new feed. Before I dive into the solo topics that I’m going to be tackling today, I wanted to remind you that there are two exclusive Startups For The Rest Of Us episodes that have never aired on this feed. And you can get them simply by entering your email address at startupsfortherestofus.com. Two never before released podcast episodes called Eight Things You Must Know When Launching Your SaaS, and 10 Things You Should Know as You Scale Your SaaS. So it’s launching and scaling. And I have these handy PDF guides for the episodes. If you don’t want to listen to the full MP3, you can look through at the points I make. And these are evergreen episodes of lessons that I’ve learned in the 20-ish years that I’ve been thinking about and starting and advising and investing in SaaS companies. So startupsfortherestofus.com if you want to get on the email list. And with that, let’s dive into my first topic of the day. The first revolves around how I often talk about how success is hard work, luck and skill, and it’s different percentages or varying degrees of each. And sometimes you don’t have any luck and you just work really hard and you bring a lot of skill to it, and you’re successful. You brute force it, you grind your way through. And other times, luck is a huge factor and you get 10 times more luck than someone else and maybe you don’t need as much hard work and skill to make it. And other times you put in the hard work and you have the skill, but luck turns against you. And to illustrate this, I want to take you back to 2001. And there is a band called Sugarcult. No one’s ever heard of them. And the only reason I had heard of them is they were kind of like a pop punk band, like a Blink-182 type thing. And a friend of mine went to college with, I don’t know, two or three of the guys in this band. And we were into that type of music, me and this friend, let’s just call him Mark. And so my friend and I actually would play guitars because I was in grunge and pop-punk bands around that time. Never did much with it, but it was just a fun hobby that I enjoyed. So he said his friend Sugarcult got signed to a major label and their single was going to come out in mid to late 2001. And I was super envious, right? This is so cool. And he kind of had talked about some of their songs and he’d shown them to me, and they were good band, and they’d been playing together for a lot of years. And the songwriter was good. They had put in the time, they had the skill to do this. We were living in LA at the time, and in LA everyone, you’ll go to a Starbucks there and there’ll be a guitarist playing and singing originals, and it is world-class amazing songs. And that was the point when I moved to LA when I realized, “Oh, I’m never going to make it as a musician.” Not that that was ever really on the table. But I realized that there were people who had put in so much more work and were so much more talented than I was on that front, that it was just never going to happen. And that’s the moment where it became, “Hey, this is a hobby and I’m going to do it for fun, and I’m never going to try to make a living at this, right, or be a professional.” But these guys had put in the time, and they were good, and they had put in the work and they were grinding and touring and playing all over la and they had been signed to a major label. And so I was excited for them. I didn’t know them. I think I met them once at a party, but they weren’t friends of mine, but they were friends of a friend. And their single was slated to come out in early September. And then September 11 happened, and the attack on the Twin Towers and America was in this massive shock. And it was this huge blow to so many things around this country and safety. And I actually remember there was a huge patriotic push. I think some people who maybe took for granted what it was to live in America or be an American, I think were reminded of that. And I just remember there being a patriotic push like I hadn’t really seen in my lifetime. And so at the same time, I think it was a week or two before September 11, Sugar Cult’s lead single came out. And I remember my friend telling me, “Oh, they’re going to get radio play and they’re going to be on MTV.” And I was a little skeptical of that. You kind of hear that stuff. You hang out with enough people in LA and it’s like, “Oh, my commercial’s going to be on”, or “I’m going to be on MTV.” And then it doesn’t happen. They get on the cutting room floor or whatever happens, things change and they don’t make it. But we did actually hear their single on the radio, which I was super impressed by. And this was their big bet. This was their first single off their first album. And if it took hold, then they could potentially have a pretty lucrative career as musicians. And the song, unluckily, as it was, was called Stuck in America. And it was a typical pop punk song of kind of like, “I’m an angsty teen and I’m stuck in-“. It wasn’t like anti-America. And in fact, we’ll play a little snippet of it here, but it’s a typical punk song that you would’ve heard for 30 or 40 years from anyone in any country. Not only was it called Stuck in America, but there was a line in it that said, “Everyone’s talking about blowing up the neighborhood”, which had no meaning prior to September 11. It’s just a turn of phrase as these 20 year old, 22-year-old kids just out of college just doing their thing and being angsty. And yet, this all took on this new really negative meaning once September 11 happened.  Sugarcult:(Singing)  Rob Walling:I remember feeling really bad for these guys because it was their break. And in entertainment you kind of get one break. They had another single, they did get some radio play, they did some touring, but that was really it for them. And to turn this to startups and entrepreneurship, the same thing can happen to you where you go to launch on Product Hunt or you go to hit your email list and some massive Google or Apple project launches on Product Hunt. I don’t know why they would, but you get the idea, you get upstaged and your best laid plans turn into nothing. Or you have your email launch list and that day when you go to launch, some massive crisis in the stock market happens and no one’s paying attention to your emails. Or any newsworthy thing that draws everyone’s attention. You know, you think about the number of things that COVID disrupted. Sometimes luck doesn’t play your way. And this is actually why hard work, luck and skill, of those three, I always bank on hard work and skill because I can build my skills and I know I can put in hard work, but luck if you try to count on it, it’s just too unpredictable. And I want strategies and approaches that are repeatable and that as much as possible, not always possible, but as much as possible are relatively proven. And I’ve seen them work over and over. And anytime you count on luck, you count on being early to a market. You count on shooting the gap and being there just at the right time as the technology catches up. That’s not a great path. It’s not repeatable. If you want to go for one in a million and buy a lottery ticket, you can do that, right? That’s a venture funded path. But trying to be a bootstrapper and rely on luck is super dangerous. And we see some people doing it. We see in our space some founders who kind of get lucky, and then when they go to do it a second or a third time, they can’t, right? And I’m not trying to say, “Oh, they’re not a good founder”, or “They’re a bad person.” It’s nothing like that. But when you think about building and growing your startup, my advice and the way that I do it myself is to put in the hard work, build the skills, do it over time in a repeatable fashion. Think in years, not months. And maybe you’ll get lucky and maybe you won’t, but it won’t matter. You’ll be successful anyways. And I do still love that quote from Thomas Jefferson, where he said, in essence, the harder I work, the luckier I get. And that’s how I think about it, is the more hard work and skill that you put into something, the more likely you are to experience that good fortune, that serendipity when the time comes. All right. Second topic of the day. I hinted at it earlier in the intro, and it’s basically that about six months ago I started feeling a twinge. And it’s a twinge of early burnout. And less burnout, it’s more of being tired of the grind of content creation. So for me, I put out 52 episodes of startups for The Rest Of Us every year and have since 2010. 52 individually outlined and recorded and produced YouTube videos, MicroConf.com slash YouTube, and 52 episodes of the MicroConf podcast, MicroConf podcast.com. It’s a lot of content. Also, some other things, live streams, TinySeed, playbooks. There’s all kinds of time spent in front of a microphone or a camera. And I’m okay with that. That’s my job. I’ve built my job. This is the best job I’ve ever had. But like anything, no matter if it’s the best job you’ve ever had had, and the job you were designed for, it’s something you’re great at and you enjoy, you do eventually burn out on things. The grind can get to you even if you love it. And so I started seeing this about six months ago, and I kind of started mentioning it to some people I work with, like producer Ron, producer Sandra, like, “Hey, I don’t want to burn out, but this is how I’m thinking about it.” And so I started thinking, how can I figure out how not to burn out? Because I have burned out in the past and it’s bad. And coming back from burnout is way harder than just avoiding it in the first place. And so I’ve taken a couple steps and I want to share them with you because I feel like this is my fifth time, seventh time, 10th time, I don’t even know if I can count how many times I’ve felt this, where I notice that I have all these audiobooks about business and startups, and I have all these podcasts about business and startups, and usually the leading factor, the leading indicator, the canary in the coal mine, is that I go to look at them and listen to them and I don’t care about any of it. I find myself just not wanting to learn one more thing about startups or business or entrepreneurship. That is a sign to me that something’s off. Because my entire life, since I was 11 or 12 years old, I have thought about, lived and breathed entrepreneurship in one form or fashion. And so anytime that I’m not feeling that way, not feeling positive to think about and talk about entrepreneurship, I know that something’s off and I’ve kind of overdosed a bit, if you will, on the content. And I need to step back and get a fresh perspective such that I can continue to create with inspiration so I’m not forcing it. And so whether this is the fifth or the 10th time I’ve dealt with it, I now have strategies that I use to cope with it to avoid burnout. Now, recovering from burnout is something my wife, Dr. Sherry Walling has talked a lot about. And if you just type in Sherry Walling, recovering from burnout, dealing with burnout, she’s recorded YouTube videos, podcast episodes, and there’s an entire chapter of the book, The Entrepreneur’s Guide, to Keeping Your [inaudible] Together, all about this. So that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m actually talking about things that I’m doing myself to avoid burning out, to avoid feeling like I’m phoning it in or avoid feeling like I just don’t want to record the next episode of a YouTube video or a podcast because I’m not there yet. And that’s a good thing, because as I said earlier, it’s easier to avoid it than to come back from it. So a few things that I’m doing. One thing I’ve started doing is I’m taking a break from recording YouTube videos on a weekly basis and even this podcast. So for a few months I’m going to batch them. So I recorded, I don’t know, four YouTube videos in a week, two weeks in a row. And so that’s almost two months of content. And now I can take a break and not have to think about the YouTube videos for a bit, and it allows me to recharge. With this podcast, I got to have five or six episodes, and that’s enough of a break. The podcast usually is less of a drain on me than the YouTube videos for whatever reason, probably because I’ve been doing the podcast longer and it just feels more natural. But being able to take a break without losing a week, without missing any weeks is important to me. It’s kind of a personal goal to get 52 of these things out year in, year out. But I will say if I do fall into burnout, if I start to crash and burn, I probably would take some drastic action and either bring in some help or there’s other things I could do, slow down the pace of YouTube videos. I have this thing though, I cannot not ship this podcast every week, so that’s not something that is even on the table. So taking a break from the grind and actually recording in advance so that I can get a break is one thing. Another thing that I’ve been doing when possible is just to take time off from work. And I took a full week off with my family, and we went up north and did some kind of glamping up there. That was amazing because there was really no cell service and there was intermittent wifi every day or two. I could check in, but realistically, it was a nice time to unplug, digitally detox. I deleted several social media apps from my phone, which I’ve continued to not pay attention to and that’s been pretty helpful. And then in the next couple of months, I will be taking just a bit more time off than usual. A, it’s summer, my kids are out of school, and it’s just a great time to get outside and travel. But also I feel this tug. I feel this hole to want to recharge. And so one of the biggest things, if you do encounter burnout and you go into full fledge burnout, a big thing you have to do is just stop working. Sometimes it’s a month or two, and it’s usually when you feel like you can’t do that, and I’m nowhere near that point, but to pull away for weeks at a time is what allows you to come back down and recharge. And so a few days here, a few days there I feel like should be good for me, given the state of things. The other thing I’m doing is I am taking a break from business podcasts and audiobooks and a lot of social media. I’m still on Twitter a little bit, but realistically I just need to step back, need to clear the head. The other thing that I’ve started doing is once or twice a week, I’m working from a new location. I’ve been working from home for about 20, well, more than 20 years now. Geez, it started when? It was 2001. So yeah, almost 22 years on and off. I had a few jobs in there, not for very long, unemployable they call me. But I’ve started working from a couple different coffee shops, and I don’t have this massive monitor. I don’t have a good recording set up. It’s super noisy. The desk isn’t the right height, all things are wrong. And yet I get incredible amounts of work done because it’s this new stimulus, it’s a new environment, and it actually causes me to work on things that I really don’t want to work on from my house. It’s like I’m tired of working from my house for now, and so I need to almost mix that up. So I think there’s a little bit of, I’m overusing the word burnout, but just frustration or boredom with the same situation. It doesn’t help that the weather’s gorgeous here, right? I’m recording this in early July of 2023, and in Minneapolis, this is the place you want to be, right? It’s amazing here in the summer. And so here I am sitting in the same room that I’ve been sitting in for however long we’ve lived in this house many years, and I look outside and it’s like, “Oh, I kind of don’t want to be here.” But somehow when I’m at a coffee shop, I feel like I am out and about and being with the people. So working from new locations is another thing I’ve done to mix it up. In addition, I’m trying to fill my time with non-work stuff on the weekends and the evenings because I have a tendency to slip into always thinking about work, which is good and bad. It’s good because it makes me productive. I’ll be thinking about it while I’m doing dishes or I’m in the shower or I’m working out or whatever, and I come across those amazing shower moments. I think Paul Graham maybe was the person who coined that, but it’s that moment where you solve a problem and it’s just because you happen to be running a background process the whole time. That’s great. The negative side of it is it burns me out. And so as a result, I’ve been trying to do more tabletop gaming. I’ve been picking up my guitar a lot more than I used to. I’ve been revisiting old music that used to inspire me, stuff from the nineties, even the early two thousands. I don’t listen to a lot of that anymore. Whatever it is. It’s like No Effects and Blink-182 and kind of just the grunge and the pop punk from that era. And that’s been helping change these patterns because I’ve been listening to the same music now on and off for months, and I’m kind of burned out on it. So going backwards, going back and listening to old Beatles stuff, drinking some coffee, listening to some hard driving songs has really helped start to break that free. I’m trying to break the grooves, get out of the grooves that are in my head. And then the last couple things is I’ve been looking at every task. I’m really mindful now about every task that comes across my desk and I’m figuring out, A if it needs to be done, and B, if someone else can do it, if I can hand it to a VA or someone on my team or just postpone it or snooze it. How urgent is it really? It’s summertime right now. I want to keep pushing things forward, but given my mental state, I’ll say, now is not the time for me to grind. There’s a time to grind, and there’s a time to give yourself permission to rest your mind. And that’s the moment that I’m in now. And I think that will last for a few weeks, maybe a couple months. I think a couple months is actually probably a lot longer than it will last. But I think having started this stuff a couple weeks ago, I think that within the next month or two, I will be back. And already, I was at a coffee shop today and I just started going down the Trello board. And instead of being frustrated with all of it, I just hammered through a bunch of tasks. It’s the tasks that stay on your to-do list for weeks and weeks and you think to yourself, “Oh, it’s going to take so much time”, and then you hammer through five of them in two hours. I hate those tasks because it’s so frustrating, right? It’s like this procrastination machine that gets in your own head. And so I’ve already been able to break through those. And lastly, the other thing I’ve done is I’ve pulled a few “fun” work projects that are not super urgent, but have been on my list for… it’s kind of a wishlist of I wish this existed. I wish this was getting done. I wanted to make some very minor updates to the WordPress theme on Startups For The Rest Of Us, for example. And there was a couple other things that have just been hanging around. They’ve been bugging me. And so I took the time, I took a few hours and hammered them out and got them started. And I’m excited about those because I wanted to get them going. They’ve been bothering me for a long time, and it is motivating to see motion on those fronts. So even though it is not the most urgent thing that I should be working on right now, again, I gave myself permission to maybe do something that isn’t the 100% logical choice, but that will help me be motivated to keep pushing forward. So if you’re experiencing burnout or you feel like you’re approaching it, hopefully those ideas are some helpful tips that you can take away coming from someone, me, who’s dealt with this a lot in my life, and eventually I’ve gotten over it each time. It just takes more time the further I get into it. And so being able to identify it early, I think is a key piece to that. My next topic is one I call bad player or bad instrument. So my youngest son, he turns 13 next week, he has been playing violin since he was three. And so he’s a decade into this instrument, and he is really, really good. He will play Bach, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Mozart as written. Normally, when you start out, you have these simplified versions, and he will play these very complex pieces of music virtually flawlessly. He’s a pretty incredible musician. I’m super envious of him, actually. He has perfect pitch. He learned it. It was not natural, but I can clank a cup with a spoon, and he’ll tell me what note it is, and he’ll say, “Oh, that’s a C sharp.” Or he’ll say, “Look, well, it’s between a C and a C sharp.” I’m like, “Are you joking?” And then I’ll go play it on my guitar or on the piano, and he’s right. And he’s a way better musician than I am, than I will ever be for sure. So what’s interesting is he picked up his first, I think it’s his first violin from when he was three, maybe it was one from when he was five. It’s this tiny, tiny, tiny little violin, and these things sound terrible. They’re cheap and because people know, the violin makers know, they’re going to only use them for six months or a year and then outgrown them, and they just don’t sound very good. And so he picked it up and he was playing these complex pieces of music on it, but it sounded like crap. And it occurred to me that if you didn’t know him, you wouldn’t know “Is he a bad player or is it a bad instrument?” And by bad, I mean poor quality. The sound quality isn’t great because even if you put an amazing player on a crappy instrument, you’re not going to get an amazing sound. And that got me thinking, of course, as it is apt to do about SaaS marketing. Really startup marketing in general. And about the challenges of knowing if you pick a marketing approach and implement it and it doesn’t work, is it a bad player or a bad instrument? Meaning did you just not do it very well? Or is the marketing approach not a fit for your type of company at this point in time? And I hate that uncertainty, right? You don’t want that many variables because then you don’t get to an answer with much certainty. And so there’s been some advice I’ve been giving to a lot of TinySeed companies where they go to start a new marketing approach. And my advice is, “If you have the budget, hire someone who’s really good at this, who has a proven track record doing exactly what you need.” So if it’s cold outreach, hire one of the productized companies that do this. If it is SEO, learn enough about it yourself, but then get advice, pay for advice so you know that you’re doing it well. If it’s pay-per-click ads, Facebook ads, ad words, you know, you get the idea. These different marketing tactics, if you have the budget. And of course with TinySeed companies, we’ve given them funding. So the answer usually is they have the budget. And my advice is you want to eliminate the possibility that you’re doing it wrong. And is there still some possibility that you hire someone who’s good at it and they do it wrong? There is, but it’s a lot lower than you trying to figure it out. And this is coming from me, Captain Bootstrap, who learned every marketing approach at all my startups, and at least I either implemented them myself or would then teach junior people that I would hire. I never followed this advice and I wish I had because I wasted a lot of time figuring this stuff out, and I wasted a lot of time figuring out marketing approaches that weren’t a fit for my companies. And I don’t regret learning the ones that worked because then I could run them and tweak them and optimize them and all that. And that’s how I grew HitTail into a mid six-figure company. And that’s how we grew Drip into many millions in revenue and all the things that came before it. So I don’t have regrets around it per se, but I know that I spent a lot of time kind of flailing and grinding on things where I probably should have found someone who was better at them than I to hire them to at least prove it out and then maybe I learn it and take it over. Or maybe I keep paying them because if they’re generating new revenue, then I have the money to try that next marketing approach. Those are my three topics for today. I hope you enjoyed this Rob solo adventure, and I hope you’re looking forward to the rest of this year. 2023 is shaping up to be super interesting and recovery from 2022. Things are starting to go up into the right a bit more. We’re seeing the stock market recover. We’re seeing some M\u0026A activity start to reemerge. Funding rounds are getting closed just a bit more. It’s not like 2021, but it’s better than 2022. And even if you don’t depend on any of that, there’s just more money moving through the system. And so now’s a great time to focus, double down, avoid burnout, and keep pushing it forward. Thanks so much for listening this and every week.
